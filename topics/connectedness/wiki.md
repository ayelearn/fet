In mathematics, connectedness[1] is used to refer to various properties
meaning, in some sense, "all one piece". When a mathematical object has such a
property, we say it is connected; otherwise it is disconnected. When a
disconnected object can be split naturally into connected pieces, each piece is
usually called a component (or connected component).

***** Connectedness in topology[edit] *****
Main article: Connected_space
A topological_space is said to be connected if it is not the union of two
disjoint nonempty open_sets[2]. A set is open if it contains no point lying on
its boundary; thus, in an informal, intuitive sense, the fact that a space can
be partitioned into disjoint open sets suggests that the boundary between the
two sets is not part of the space, and thus splits it into two separate pieces.
***** Other notions of connectedness[edit] *****
Fields of mathematics are typically concerned with special kinds of objects.
Often such an object is said to be connected if, when it is considered as a
topological space, it is a connected space. Thus, manifolds, Lie_groups, and
graphs are all called connected if they are connected as topological spaces,
and their components are the topological components. Sometimes it is convenient
to restate the definition of connectedness in such fields. For example, a graph
is said to be connected if each pair of vertices in the graph is joined by a
path. This definition is equivalent to the topological one, as applied to
graphs, but it is easier to deal with in the context of graph_theory. Graph
theory also offers a context-free measure of connectedness, called the
clustering_coefficient.
Other fields of mathematics are concerned with objects that are rarely
considered as topological spaces. Nonetheless, definitions of connectedness
often reflect the topological meaning in some way. For example, in category
theory, a category is said to be connected if each pair of objects in it is
joined by a sequence of morphisms. Thus, a category is connected if it is,
intuitively, all one piece.
There may be different notions of connectedness that are intuitively similar,
but different as formally defined concepts. We might wish to call a topological
space connected if each pair of points in it is joined by a path. However this
condition turns out to be stronger than standard topological connectedness; in
particular, there are connected topological spaces for which this property does
not hold. Because of this, different terminology is used; spaces with this
property are said to be path_connected. While not all connected spaces are path
connected, all path connected spaces are connected.
Terms involving connected are also used for properties that are related to, but
clearly different from, connectedness. For example, a path-connected
topological space is simply_connected if each loop (path from a point to
itself) in it is contractible; that is, intuitively, if there is essentially
only one way to get from any point to any other point. Thus, a sphere and a
disk are each simply connected, while a torus is not. As another example, a
directed_graph is strongly_connected if each ordered_pair of vertices is joined
by a directed_path (that is, one that "follows the arrows").
Other concepts express the way in which an object is not connected. For
example, a topological space is totally_disconnected if each of its components
is a single point.
***** Connectivity[edit] *****
Main article: Connectivity_(graph_theory)
Properties and parameters based on the idea of connectedness often involve the
word connectivity. For example, in graph_theory, a connected_graph is one from
which we must remove at least one vertex to create a disconnected graph[3]. In
recognition of this, such graphs are also said to be 1-connected. Similarly, a
graph is 2-connected if we must remove at least two vertices from it, to create
a disconnected graph. A 3-connected graph requires the removal of at least
three vertices, and so on. The connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of
vertices that must be removed to disconnect it. Equivalently, the connectivity
of a graph is the greatest integer k for which the graph is k-connected.
While terminology varies, noun forms of connectedness-related properties often
include the term connectivity. Thus, when discussing simply connected
topological spaces, it is far more common to speak of simple connectivity than
simple connectedness. On the other hand, in fields without a formally defined
notion of connectivity, the word may be used as a synonym for connectedness.
Another example of connectivity can be found in regular tilings. Here, the
connectivity describes the number of neighbors accessible from a single tile:
    * 3-connectivity in a triangular_tiling, 
    * 4-connectivity in a square_tiling, 
    * 6-connectivity in a hexagonal_tiling, 
    * 8-connectivity in a square_tiling (note that distance equity is not kept)
