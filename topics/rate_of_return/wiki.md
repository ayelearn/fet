****** Rate of return ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In finance, return is a profit on an investment.[1] It comprises any change in
value of the investment, and/or cash_flows which the investor receives from the
investment, such as interest payments or dividends. It may be measured either
in absolute terms (e.g., dollars) or as a percentage of the amount invested.
The latter is also called the holding_period_return.
A loss instead of a profit is described as a negative_return, assuming the
amount invested is greater than zero.
The rate of return is a profit on an investment over a period of time,
expressed as a proportion of the original investment.[2] The time period is
typically a year, in which case the rate of return is referred to as the annual
return.
To compare returns over time periods of different lengths on an equal basis, it
is useful to convert each return into an annualised return. This conversion
process is called annualisation, described below.
The return_on_investment (ROI) is return per dollar invested. It is a measure
of investment performance, as opposed to size (c.f. return_on_equity, return_on
assets, return_on_capital_employed).

***** Calculation[edit] *****
The return, or rate of return, can be calculated over a single period. The
single period may last any length of time.
The overall period may however instead be divided into contiguous sub-periods.
This means that there is more than one time period, each sub-period beginning
at the point in time where the previous one ended. In such a case, where there
are multiple contiguous sub-periods, the return and rate of return over the
overall period can be calculated, by combining together the returns within each
of the sub-periods.
**** Single-period[edit] ****
*** Return[edit] ***
The return over a single period of any length of time is:
         R =     V  f   &#x2212;  V  i     V  i       {\displaystyle R={\frac
      {V_{f}-V_{i}}{V_{i}}}}  [{\displaystyle R={\frac {V_{f}-V_{i}}{V_{i}}}}]
where:
          V  f     {\displaystyle V_{f}}  [V_{f}] = final value, including
      dividends and interest
          V  i     {\displaystyle V_{i}}  [V_{i}] = initial value
For example, if someone purchases 100 shares at a starting price of 10, the
starting value is 100 x 10 = 1,000. If the shareholder then collects 0.50 per
share in cash dividends, and the ending share price is 9.80, then at the end
the shareholder has 100 x 0.50 = 50 in cash, plus 100 x 9.80 = 980 in shares,
totalling a final value of 1,030. The change in value is 1,030 - 1,000 = 30, so
the return is       30  1 , 000    = 3 &#x0025;   {\displaystyle {\frac {30}
{1,000}}=3\%}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {30}{1,000}}=3\%}].
*** Negative initial value[edit] ***
Return measures the increase in size of an asset or liability or short
position.
A negative initial value usually occurs for a liability or short position. If
the initial value is negative, and the final value is more negative, then the
return will be positive. In such a case, the positive return represents a loss
rather than a profit.
If the initial value is zero, then no return can be calculated.
*** Currency of measurement[edit] ***
The return, or rate of return, depends on the currency of measurement. For
example, suppose a 10,000 USD (US dollar) cash deposit earns 2% interest over a
year, so its value at the end of the year is 10,200 USD including interest. The
return over the year is 2%, measured in USD. Let us suppose also that the
exchange rate to Japanese yen at the start of the year is 120 yen per USD, and
132 yen per USD at the end of the year. The value in yen of one USD has
increased by 10% over the period. The deposit is worth 1.2 million yen at the
start of the year, and 10,200 x 132 = 1,346,400 yen at the end of the year. The
return on the deposit over the year in yen terms is therefore:
            1 , 346 , 400 &#x2212; 1 , 200 , 000   1 , 200 , 000    = 12.2
      &#x0025;   {\displaystyle {\frac {1,346,400-1,200,000}
      {1,200,000}}=12.2\%}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1,346,400-1,200,000}
      {1,200,000}}=12.2\%}]
This is the rate of return experienced either by an investor who starts with
yen, converts to dollars, invests in the USD deposit, and converts the eventual
proceeds back to yen; or for any investor, who wishes to measure the return in
Japanese yen terms, for comparison purposes.
*** Annualisation[edit] ***
Without any reinvestment, a return     R   {\displaystyle R}  [R] over a period
of time     t   {\displaystyle t}  [t] is equivalent to a rate of return:
           R t     {\displaystyle {\frac {R}{t}}}  [{\frac {R}{t}}]
For example, let us suppose that 20,000 USD is returned on an initial
investment of 100,000 USD for a rate of 20%. The 20,000 USD is paid in 5
irregularly-timed installments of 4,000 USD, with no reinvestment, over a 5-
year period, and with no information provided about the timing of the
installments. The rate of return is 4,000 / 100,000 = 4% per year.
Assuming returns are reinvested however, due to the effect of compounding, the
relationship between a rate of return     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r], and a
return     R   {\displaystyle R}  [R] over a length of time     t
{\displaystyle t}  [t] is:
         1 + R = ( 1 + r  )  t     {\displaystyle 1+R=(1+r)^{t}}  [1 + R = (1 +
      r)^t]
which can be used to convert the return     R   {\displaystyle R}  [R] to a
compound rate of return     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r]:
         r = ( 1 + R  )   1 t    &#x2212; 1 =    1 + R   t    &#x2212; 1
      {\displaystyle r=(1+R)^{\frac {1}{t}}-1={\sqrt[{t}]{1+R}}-1}  [
      {\displaystyle r=(1+R)^{\frac {1}{t}}-1={\sqrt[{t}]{1+R}}-1}]
For example, a 33.1% return over 3 months is equivalent to a rate of:
           1.331  3    &#x2212; 1 = 10 &#x0025;   {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{3}]
      {1.331}}-1=10\%}  [{\displaystyle {\sqrt[{3}]{1.331}}-1=10\%}]
per month with reinvestment.
Annualisation is the process described above, of converting a return     R
{\displaystyle R}  [R] to an annual rate of return     r   {\displaystyle r}
[r], where the length of the period     t   {\displaystyle t}  [t] is measured
in years and the rate of return     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] is per year.
According to the CFA Institute's Global Investment Performance Standards
(GIPS),[3]
      "Returns for periods of less than one year must not be annualized."
This is because an annualised rate of return over a period of less than one
year is statistically unlikely to be indicative of the annualised rate of
return over the long run, where there is risk involved.[4] Annualizing a return
over a period of less than one year might be interpreted as suggesting that the
rest of the year is most likely to have the same rate of return, effectively
projecting that rate of return over the whole year.
Note that this does not apply to interest rates or yields where there is no
significant risk involved. It is common practice to quote an annualised rate of
return for borrowing or lending money for periods shorter than a year, such as
overnight interbank rates.
*** Logarithmic or continuously compounded return[edit] ***
The logarithmic return or continuously_compounded_return, also known as force
of_interest, is:
         R = ln &#x2061;  (    V  f    V  i     )    {\displaystyle R=\ln \left
      ({\frac {V_{f}}{V_{i}}}\right)}  [R = \ln\left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right)]
and the logarithmic rate of return is:
          r   l o g    =    ln &#x2061;  (    V  f    V  i     )   t
      {\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {log} }={\frac {\ln \left({\frac {V_{f}}{V_
      {i}}}\right)}{t}}}  [r_{\mathrm{log}} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{V_f}
      {V_i}\right)}{t}]
or equivalently it is the solution     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] to the
equation:
          V  f   =  V  i    e  r t     {\displaystyle V_{f}=V_{i}e^{rt}}  [V_f
      = V_i e^{rt}]
where:
         r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] = logarithmic rate of return
         t   {\displaystyle t}  [t] = length of time period
For example, if a stock is priced at 3.570 USD per share at the close on one
day, and at 3.575 USD per share at the close the next day, then the logarithmic
return is: ln(3.575/3.570) = 0.0014, or 0.14%.
*** Annualisation of logarithmic return[edit] ***
Under an assumption of reinvestment, the relationship between a logarithmic
return     R   {\displaystyle R}  [R] and a logarithmic rate of return     r
{\displaystyle r}  [r] over a period of time of length     t   {\displaystyle
t}  [t] is:
         R = r t   {\displaystyle R=rt}  [R = rt]
so trivially     r =   R t     {\displaystyle r={\frac {R}{t}}}  [r = \frac{R}
{t}] is the annualised logarithmic rate of return for a return     R
{\displaystyle R}  [R], where     t   {\displaystyle t}  [t] is measured in
years.
For example, if the logarithmic return of a security per trading day is 0.14%,
assuming 250 trading days in a year, then the annualised logarithmic rate of
return is 0.14%/(1/250) = 0.14% x 250 = 35%
**** Returns over multiple periods[edit] ****
When the return is calculated over a series of sub-periods of time, the return
in each sub-period is based on the investment value at the beginning of the
sub-period.
Assuming returns are reinvested, if the returns over     n   {\displaystyle n}
[n] successive time sub-periods are      r  1   ,  r  2   ,  r  3   , &#x22EF;
,  r  n     {\displaystyle r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},\cdots ,r_{n}}  [r_1, r_2, r_3,
\cdots, r_n], then the cumulative return or overall return over the overall
time period using the time-weighted method is the result of compounding the
returns together:
         ( 1 +  r  1   ) ( 1 +  r  2   ) &#x22EF; ( 1 +  r  n   ) &#x2212; 1
      {\displaystyle (1+r_{1})(1+r_{2})\cdots (1+r_{n})-1}  [(1 + r_1)(1 + r_2)
      \cdots (1 + r_n) - 1]
If the returns are logarithmic returns however, the logarithmic return over the
overall time period is:
          &#x2211;  i = 1   n     r  i    =  r  1   +  r  2   +  r  3   +
      &#x22EF; +  r  n     {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}{r_{i}}=r_{1}+r_{2}+r_
      {3}+\cdots +r_{n}}  [\sum_{i=1}^n {r_i} = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + \cdots + r_n]
This formula applies with an assumption of reinvestment of returns and
application of the time-weighted return method.
*** Arithmetic average rate of return[edit] ***
The arithmetic average rate of return over     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] time
periods of equal length is defined as:
            r &#x00AF;    =   1 n    &#x2211;  i = 1   n     r  i    =   1 n
      (  r  1   + &#x22EF; +  r  n   )   {\displaystyle {\bar {r}}={\frac {1}
      {n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}{r_{i}}={\frac {1}{n}}(r_{1}+\cdots +r_{n})}  [\bar{r}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n {r_i}  =  \frac{1}{n} (r_1+\cdots+r_n)]
If you have a sequence of logarithmic rates of return over equal successive
periods, the appropriate method of finding their average is the arithmetic
average rate of return.
*** Geometric average rate of return[edit] ***
Further information: True_time-weighted_rate_of_return
For ordinary returns, if there is no reinvestment, and losses are made good by
topping up the capital invested, so that the value is brought back to its
starting-point at the beginning of each new sub-period, use the arithmetic
average return.
With reinvestment of all gains and losses however, the appropriate average rate
of return is the geometric average rate of return over n periods, which is:
             r &#x00AF;      g e o m e t r i c    = (  &#x220F;  i = 1   n
      ( 1 +  r  i   )  )   1 n    &#x2212; 1 =     &#x220F;  i = 1   n   ( 1 +
      r  i   )   n    &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle {\bar {r}}_{\mathrm
      {geometric} }=(\prod _{i=1}^{n}(1+r_{i}))^{\frac {1}{n}}-1={\sqrt[{n}]
      {\prod _{i=1}^{n}(1+r_{i})}}-1}  [{\displaystyle {\bar {r}}_{\mathrm
      {geometric} }=(\prod _{i=1}^{n}(1+r_{i}))^{\frac {1}{n}}-1={\sqrt[{n}]
      {\prod _{i=1}^{n}(1+r_{i})}}-1}]
Note that the geometric average return is equivalent to the cumulative return
over the whole n periods, converted into a rate of return per period.
In the case where the periods are each a year long, and there is no
reinvestment of returns, the annualized cumulative return is the arithmetic
average return. Where the individual sub-periods are each a year, and there is
reinvestment of returns, the annualized cumulative return is the geometric
average rate of return.
For example, assuming reinvestment, the cumulative return for annual returns:
50%, -20%, 30% and -40% is:
         ( 1 + 0.50 ) ( 1 &#x2212; 0.20 ) ( 1 + 0.30 ) ( 1 &#x2212; 0.40 )
      &#x2212; 1 = &#x2212; 0.0640 = &#x2212; 6.40 &#x0025;   {\displaystyle
      (1+0.50)(1-0.20)(1+0.30)(1-0.40)-1=-0.0640=-6.40\%}  [(1+0.50)(1-0.20)
      (1+0.30)(1-0.40)-1=-0.0640=-6.40\%]
and the geometric average is:
            ( 1 + 0.50 ) ( 1 &#x2212; 0.20 ) ( 1 + 0.30 ) ( 1 &#x2212; 0.40 )
      4    &#x2212; 1 = &#x2212; 0.0164 = &#x2212; 1.64 &#x0025;
      {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{4}]{(1+0.50)(1-0.20)(1+0.30)(1-0.40)}}-1=-0.0164=-
      1.64\%}  [{\displaystyle {\sqrt[{4}]{(1+0.50)(1-0.20)(1+0.30)(1-0.40)}}-
      1=-0.0164=-1.64\%}]
which is equal to the annualized cumulative return:
            1 &#x2212; 0.0640   4    &#x2212; 1 = &#x2212; 0.0164
      {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{4}]{1-0.0640}}-1=-0.0164}  [{\displaystyle {\sqrt[
      {4}]{1-0.0640}}-1=-0.0164}]
***** Comparisons between various rates of return[edit] *****
**** External flows[edit] ****
In the presence of external flows, such as cash or securities moving into or
out of the portfolio, the return should be calculated by compensating for these
movements. This is achieved using methods such as the time-weighted_return.
Time-weighted returns compensate for the impact of cash flows. This is useful
to assess the performance of a money manager on behalf of his/her clients,
where typically the clients control these cash flows.[5]
**** Fees[edit] ****
To measure returns net of fees, allow the value of the portfolio to be reduced
by the amount of the fees. To calculate returns gross of fees, compensate for
them by treating them as an external flow, and exclude accrued fees from
valuations.
**** Money-weighted rate of return[edit] ****
Like the time-weighted return, the money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) or
dollar-weighted rate of return also takes cash flows into consideration. They
are useful evaluating and comparing cases where the money manager controls cash
flows, for example private equity. (Contrast with the true time-weighted rate
of return, which is most applicable to measure the performance of a money
manager who does not have control over external flows.)
*** Internal rate of return[edit] ***
Main article: Internal_rate_of_return
The internal rate of return (IRR) (which is a variety of money-weighted rate of
return) is the rate of return which makes the net_present_value of cash flows
zero. It is a solution     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] satisfying the following
equation:
           NPV   =  &#x2211;  t = 0   n      C  t    ( 1 + r  )  t      = 0
      {\displaystyle {\mbox{NPV}}=\sum _{t=0}^{n}{\frac {C_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}}=0}
      [\mbox{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1+r)^{t}} =0]
where:
      NPV = net present value
and
           C  t      {\displaystyle {C_{t}}}  [{C_t}] = net cash_flow at time
      t    {\displaystyle {t}}  [{t}], including the initial value       C  0
      {\displaystyle {C_{0}}}  [{C_0}] and final value       C  n
      {\displaystyle {C_{n}}}  [{C_n}], net of any other flows at the beginning
      and at the end respectively. (The initial value is treated as an inflow,
      and the final value as an outflow.)
When the internal rate of return is greater than the cost_of_capital, (which is
also referred to as the required rate of return), the investment adds value,
i.e. the net present value of cash flows, discounted at the cost of capital, is
greater than zero. Otherwise, the investment does not add value.
Note that there is not always an internal rate of return for a particular set
of cash flows (i.e. the existence of a real solution to the equation       NPV
= 0   {\displaystyle {\mbox{NPV}}=0}  [\mbox{NPV} = 0] depends on the pattern
of cash flows). There may also be more than one real solution to the equation,
requiring some interpretation to determine the most appropriate one.
*** Money-weighted return over multiple sub-periods[edit] ***
Note that the money-weighted return over multiple sub-periods is generally not
equal to the result of combining together the money-weighted returns within the
sub-periods using the method described above, unlike time-weighted returns.
**** Comparing ordinary return with logarithmic return[edit] ****
The value of an investment is doubled if the return     r   {\displaystyle r}
[ r] = +100%, that is, if      r   l o g      {\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {log}
}}  [r_{\mathrm{log}}] = ln($200 / $100) = ln(2) = 69.3%. The value falls to
zero when     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] = -100%. The ordinary return can be
calculated for any non-zero initial investment value, and any final value,
positive or negative, but the logarithmic return can only be calculated when
V  f    /   V  i   > 0   {\displaystyle V_{f}/V_{i}>0}  [ V_f/V_i > 0].
Ordinary returns and logarithmic returns are only equal when they are zero, but
they are approximately equal when they are small. The difference between them
is large only when percent changes are high. For example, an arithmetic return
of +50% is equivalent to a logarithmic return of 40.55%, while an arithmetic
return of -50% is equivalent to a logarithmic return of -69.31%.

**** Symmetry of logarithmic returns[edit] ****
Logarithmic returns are useful for mathematical finance. One of the advantages
is that the logarithmic returns are symmetric, while ordinary returns are not:
positive and negative percent ordinary returns of equal magnitude do not cancel
each other out and result in a net change, but logarithmic returns of equal
magnitude but opposite signs will cancel each other out. This means that an
investment of $100 that yields an arithmetic return of 50% followed by an
arithmetic return of -50% will result in $75, while an investment of $100 that
yields a logarithmic return of 50% followed by a logarithmic return of -50%
will come back to $100.
**** Comparing geometric with arithmetic average rates of return[edit] ****
The geometric average rate of return is in general less than the arithmetic
average return. The two averages are equal if (and only if) all the sub-period
returns are equal. This is a consequence of the AM√¢¬Ä¬ìGM_inequality. The
difference between the annualized return and average annual return increases
with the variance of the returns √¢¬Ä¬ì the more volatile the performance, the
greater the difference.[note_1]
For example, a return of +10%, followed by √¢¬à¬í10%, gives an arithmetic average
return of 0%, but the overall result over the 2 sub-periods is 110% x 90% = 99%
for an overall return of √¢¬à¬í1%. The order in which the loss and gain occurs
does not affect the result.
For a return of +20%, followed by √¢¬à¬í20%, this again has an average return of
0%, but an overall return of √¢¬à¬í4%.
A return of +100%, followed by √¢¬à¬í100%, has an average return of 0%, but an
overall return of √¢¬à¬í100%, as the final value is 0.
In cases of leveraged investments, even more extreme results are possible: a
return of +200%, followed by √¢¬à¬í200%, has an average return of 0%, but an
overall return of √¢¬à¬í300%.
This pattern is not followed in the case of logarithmic returns, due to their
symmetry, as noted above. A logarithmic return of +10%, followed by √¢¬à¬í10%,
gives an overall return of 10% - 10% = 0%, and an average rate of return of
zero also.
*** Average returns and overall returns[edit] ***
Investment returns are often published as "average returns". In order to
translate average returns into overall returns, compound the average returns
over the number of periods.
                Example #1 Level Rates of Return
                                 Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  Year 4
Rate of Return                   5%      5%      5%      5%
Geometric Average at End of Year 5%      5%      5%      5%
Capital at End of Year           $105.00 $110.25 $115.76 $121.55
Dollar Profit/(Loss)                                     $21.55
The geometric average rate of return was 5%. Over 4 years, this translates into
an overall return of:
          1.05  4   &#x2212; 1 = 21.55 &#x0025;   {\displaystyle 1.05^{4}-
      1=21.55\%}  [1.05^4-1=21.55\%]

Dollar Profit/(Loss)                                     ($6.40)
The geometric average return over the 4-year period was -1.64%. Over 4 years,
this translates into an overall return of:
         ( 1 &#x2212; 0.0164  )  4   &#x2212; 1 = &#x2212; 6.4 &#x0025;
      {\displaystyle (1-0.0164)^{4}-1=-6.4\%}  [(1-0.0164)^4-1=-6.4\%]

Dollar Profit/(Loss)                                  ($89.25)
The geometric average return over the 4-year period was -42.74%. Over 4 years,
this translates back into an overall return of:
         ( 1 &#x2212; 0.4274  )  4   &#x2212; 1 = &#x2212; 89.25 &#x0025;
      {\displaystyle (1-0.4274)^{4}-1=-89.25\%}  [(1-0.4274)^4-1=-89.25\%]
**** Annual returns and annualized returns[edit] ****
Care must be taken not to confuse annual with annualized returns. An annual
rate of return is a return over a period of one year, such as January 1 through
December 31, or June 3, 2006 through June 2, 2007, whereas an annualized rate
of return is a rate of return per year, measured over a period either longer or
shorter than one year, such as a month, or two years, annualised for comparison
with a one-year return.
The appropriate method of annualization depends on whether returns are
reinvested or not.
For example, a return over one month of 1% converts to an annualized rate of
return of 12.7% = ((1+0.01)12 - 1). This means if reinvested, earning 1% return
every month, the return over 12 months would compound to give a return of
12.7%.
As another example, a two-year return of 10% converts to an annualized rate of
return of 4.88% = ((1+0.1)(12/24) - 1), assuming reinvestment at the end of the
first year. In other words, the geometric average return per year is 4.88%.
In the cash flow example below, the dollar returns for the four years add up to
$265. Assuming no reinvestment, the annualized rate of return for the four
years is: $265 √É¬∑ ($1,000 x 4 years) = 6.625% (per year).
 Cash Flow Example on $1,000 Investment
              Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4
Dollar Return $100   $55    $60    $50
ROI           10%    5.5%   6%     5%
***** Uses[edit] *****
    * Rates of return are useful for making investment decisions. For nominal
      risk investments such as savings accounts or Certificates of Deposit, the
      investor considers the effects of reinvesting/compounding on increasing
      savings balances over time to project expected gains into the future. For
      investments in which capital is at risk, such as stock shares, mutual
      fund shares and home purchases, the investor also takes into
      consideration the effects of price volatility and risk of loss.
    * Ratios typically used by financial analysts to compare a company√¢¬Ä¬ôs
      performance over time or compare performance between companies include
      return on investment (ROI), return_on_equity, and return_on_assets.[6]
    * In the capital_budgeting process, companies would traditionally compare
      the internal_rates_of_return of different projects to decide which
      projects to pursue in order to maximize returns for the company's
      stockholders. Other tools employed by companies in capital budgeting
      include payback period, net_present_value, and profitability_index.[7]
    * A return may be adjusted for taxes to give the after-tax rate of return.
      This is done in geographical areas or historical times in which taxes
      consumed or consume a significant portion of profits or income. The
      after-tax rate of return is calculated by multiplying the rate of return
      by the tax rate, then subtracting that percentage from the rate of
      return.
    * A return of 5% taxed at 15% gives an after-tax return of 4.25%
            0.05 x 0.15 = 0.0075
            0.05 - 0.0075 = 0.0425 = 4.25%
    * A return of 10% taxed at 25% gives an after-tax return of 7.5%
            0.10 x 0.25 = 0.025
            0.10 - 0.025 = 0.075 = 7.5%
      Investors usually seek a higher rate of return on taxable investment
      returns than on non-taxable investment returns, and the proper way to
      compare returns taxed at different rates of tax is after tax, from the
      end-investor's perspective.
    * A return may be adjusted for inflation. When return is adjusted for
      inflation, the resulting return in real terms measures the change in
      purchasing_power between the start and the end of the period. Any
      investment with a nominal annual return (i.e. unadjusted annual return)
      less than the annual inflation_rate represents a loss of value in real
      terms, even when the nominal annual return is greater than 0%, and the
      purchasing power at the end of the period is less than the purchasing
      power at the beginning.
    * Many online_poker_tools include ROI in a player's tracked statistics,
      assisting users in evaluating an opponent's performance.
***** Time value of money[edit] *****
Main article: time_value_of_money
Investments generate returns to the investor to compensate the investor for the
time_value_of_money.
Factors that investors may use to determine the rate of return at which they
are willing to invest money include:
    * their risk-free_interest_rate
    * estimates of future inflation rates
    * assessment of the risk of the investment, i.e. the uncertainty of returns
      (including how likely it is that investors will receive interest/dividend
      payments they expect and the return of their full capital, with or
      without any possible additional capital_gain)
    * currency_risk
    * whether or not the investors want the money available (√¢¬Ä¬úliquid√¢¬Ä¬ù) for
      other uses.
The time value of money is reflected in the interest_rate that a bank offers
for deposit_accounts, and also in the interest rate that a bank charges for a
loan such as a home mortgage. The "risk-free" rate on US dollar investments is
the rate on U.S._Treasury_bills, because this is the highest rate available
without risking capital.
The rate of return which an investor requires from a particular investment is
called the discount_rate, and is also referred to as the (opportunity) cost_of
capital. The higher the risk, the higher the discount rate (rate of return) the
investor will demand from the investment.
***** Compounding or reinvesting[edit] *****
Main article: compound_interest
The annualized return of an investment depends on whether or not the return,
including interest and dividends, from one period is reinvested in the next
period. If the return is reinvested, it contributes to the starting value of
capital invested for the next period (or reduces it, in the case of a negative
return). Compounding reflects the effect of the return in one period on the
return in the next period, resulting from the change in the capital base at the
start of the latter period.
For example, if an investor puts $1,000 in a 1-year certificate of deposit (CD)
that pays an annual interest rate of 4%, paid quarterly, the CD would earn 1%
interest per quarter on the account balance. The account uses compound
interest, meaning the account balance is cumulative, including interest
previously reinvested and credited to the account. Unless the interest is
withdrawn at the end of each quarter, it will earn more interest in the next
quarter.
                           Compound Interest Example
                                1st Quarter 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter
Capital at the beginning of the $1,000      $1,010      $1,020.10   $1,030.30
period
Dollar return for the period    $10         $10.10      $10.20      $10.30
Account Balance at end of the   $1,010.00   $1,020.10   $1,030.30   $1,040.60
period
Quarterly return                1%          1%          1%          1%
At the beginning of the second quarter, the account balance is $1,010.00, which
then earns $10.10 interest altogether during the second quarter. The extra dime
was interest on the additional $10 investment from the previous interest
accumulated in the account. The annualized return (annual percentage yield,
compound interest) is higher than for simple interest, because the interest is
reinvested as capital and then itself earns interest. The yield or annualized
return on the above investment is     4.06 &#x0025; = ( 1.01  )  4   &#x2212; 1
{\displaystyle 4.06\%=(1.01)^{4}-1}  [4.06\% = (1.01)^4-1].
***** Foreign currency returns[edit] *****
As explained above, the return, or rate or return, depends on the currency of
measurement. In the example given above, a US dollar cash deposit which returns
2% over a year, measured in US dollars, returns 12.2% measured in Japanese yen,
over the same period, if the US dollar increases in value by 10% against the
Japanese yen over the same period. The return in Japanese yen is the result of
compounding the 2% US dollar return on the cash deposit with the 10% return on
US dollars against Japanese yen:
      1.02 x 1.1 - 1 = 12.2%
In more general terms, the return in a second currency is the result of
compounding together the two returns:
         ( 1 +  r  i   ) ( 1 +  r  c   ) &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle (1+r_{i})
      (1+r_{c})-1}  [{\displaystyle (1+r_{i})(1+r_{c})-1}]
where
          r  i     {\displaystyle r_{i}}  [r_{i}] is the return on the
      investment in the first currency (US dollars in our example), and
          r  c     {\displaystyle r_{c}}  [r_{c}] is the return on the first
      currency against the second currency (which in our example is the return
      on US dollars against Japanese yen).
This holds true if either the time-weighted method is used, or there are no
flows in or out over the period. If using one of the money-weighted methods,
and there are flows, it is necessary to recalculate the return in the second
currency using one of the methods for compensating for flows.
**** Foreign currency returns over multiple periods[edit] ****
It is not meaningful to compound together returns for consecutive periods
measured in different currencies. Before compounding together returns over
consecutive periods, recalculate or adjust the returns using a single currency
of measurement.
*** Example[edit] ***
A portfolio increases in value in Singapore dollars by 10% over the 2015
calendar year (with no flows in or out of the portfolio over the year). In the
first month of 2016, it increases in value by another 7%, in US dollars.
(Again, there are no inflows or outflows over the January 2016 period.)
What is the return on the portfolio, from the beginning of 2015, to the end of
January 2016?
The answer is that there is insufficient data to compute a return, in any
currency, without knowing the return for both periods in the same currency.
If the return in 2015 was 10% in Singapore dollars, and the Singapore dollar
rose by 5% against the US dollar over 2015, then so long as there were no flows
in 2015, the return over 2015 in US dollars is:
      1.1 x 1.05 - 1 = 15.5%
The return between the beginning of 2015 and the end of January 2016 in US
dollars is:
      1.155 x 1.07 - 1 = 23.585%
***** Returns when capital is at risk[edit] *****
**** Risk and volatility[edit] ****
Main article: volatility_(finance)
Investments carry varying amounts of risk that the investor will lose some or
all of the invested capital. For example, investments in company stock shares
put capital at risk. Unlike capital invested in a savings account, the share
price, which is the market value of a stock share at a certain point in time,
depends on what someone is willing to pay for it, and the price of a stock
share tends to change continually when the market for that share is open. If
the price is relatively stable, the stock is said to have "low volatility". If
the price often changes a great deal, the stock has "high volatility".
**** US income tax on investment returns[edit] ****
                 Example: Stock with low volatility and a regular quarterly
                                    dividend, reinvested
              End of:           1st Quarter 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter
              Dividend          $1          $1.01       $1.02       $1.03
              Stock Price       $98         $101        $102        $99
              Shares Purchased  0.010204    0.01        0.01        0.010404
              Total Shares Held 1.010204    1.020204    1.030204    1.040608
              Investment Value  $99         $103.04     $105.08     $103.02
              Quarterly ROI     -1%         4.08%       1.98%       -1.96%
To the right is an example of a stock investment of one share purchased at the
beginning of the year for $100.
    * The quarterly dividend is reinvested at the quarter-end stock price.
    * The number of shares purchased each quarter = ($ Dividend)/($ Stock
      Price).
    * The final investment value of $103.02 compared with the initial
      investment of $100 means the return is $3.02 or 3.02%.
    * The continuously compounded rate of return in this example is:
         ln &#x2061;  (   103.02 100   )  = 2.98 &#x0025;   {\displaystyle \ln
      \left({\frac {103.02}{100}}\right)=2.98\%}  [\ln\left(\frac{103.02}
      {100}\right) = 2.98\%].
To calculate the capital gain for US income tax purposes, include the
reinvested dividends in the cost basis. The investor received a total of $4.06
in dividends over the year, all of which were reinvested, so the cost basis
increased by $4.06.
    * Cost Basis = $100 + $4.06 = $104.06
    * Capital gain/loss = $103.02 - $104.06 = -$1.04 (a capital loss)
For U.S. income tax purposes therefore, dividends were $4.06, the cost basis of
the investment was $104.06 and if the shares were sold at the end of the year,
the sale value would be $103.02, and the capital loss would be $1.04.
**** Mutual fund and investment company returns[edit] ****
Mutual_funds, exchange-traded_funds (ETFs), and other equitized investments
(such as unit investment trusts or UITs, insurance separate_accounts and
related variable products such as variable_universal_life_insurance policies
and variable_annuity contracts, and bank-sponsored commingled funds, collective
benefit funds or common trust funds) are essentially portfolios of various
investment securities such as stocks, bonds and money market instruments which
are equitized by selling shares or units to investors. Investors and other
parties are interested to know how the investment has performed over various
periods of time.
Performance is usually quantified by a fund's total return. In the 1990s, many
different fund companies were advertising various total returns√¢¬Ä¬îsome
cumulative, some averaged, some with or without deduction of sales loads or
commissions, etc. To level the playing field and help investors compare
performance returns of one fund to another, the U.S._Securities_and_Exchange
Commission (SEC) began requiring funds to compute and report total returns
based upon a standardized formula√¢¬Ä¬îso called "SEC Standardized total return"
which is the average annual total return assuming reinvestment of dividends and
distributions and deduction of sales loads or charges. Funds may compute and
advertise returns on other bases (so-called "non-standardized" returns), so
long as they also publish no less prominently the "standardized" return data.
Subsequent to this, apparently investors who had sold their fund shares after a
large increase in the share price in the late 1990s and early 2000s were
ignorant of how significant the impact of income/capital gain taxes was on
their fund "gross" returns. That is, they had little idea how significant the
difference could be between "gross" returns (returns before federal taxes) and
"net" returns (after-tax returns). In reaction to this apparent investor
ignorance, and perhaps for other reasons, the SEC made further rule-making to
require mutual funds to publish in their annual prospectus, among other things,
total returns before and after the impact of U.S federal individual income
taxes. And further, the after-tax returns would include 1) returns on a
hypothetical taxable account after deducting taxes_on_dividends and capital
gain distributions received during the illustrated periods and 2) the impacts
of the items in #1) as well as assuming the entire investment shares were sold
at the end of the period (realizing capital gain/loss on liquidation of the
shares). These after-tax returns would apply of course only to taxable accounts
and not to tax-deferred or retirement accounts such as IRAs.
Lastly, in more recent years, "personalized" brokerage account statements have
been demanded by investors. In other words, the investors are saying more or
less that the fund returns may not be what their actual account returns are,
based upon the actual investment account transaction history. This is because
investments may have been made on various dates and additional purchases and
withdrawals may have occurred which vary in amount and date and thus are unique
to the particular account. More and more funds and brokerage firms are now
providing personalized account returns on investor's account statements in
response to this need.
With that out of the way, here's how basic earnings and gains/losses work on a
mutual fund. The fund records income for dividends and interest earned which
typically increases the value of the mutual fund shares, while expenses set
aside have an offsetting impact to share value. When the fund's investments
increase (decrease) in market value, so too the fund shares value increases (or
decreases). When the fund sells investments at a profit, it turns or
reclassifies that paper profit or unrealized gain into an actual or realized
gain. The sale has no effect on the value of fund shares but it has
reclassified a component of its value from one bucket to another on the fund
books√¢¬Ä¬îwhich will have future impact to investors. At least annually, a fund
usually pays dividends from its net income (income less expenses) and net
capital gains realized out to shareholders as an IRS requirement. This way, the
fund pays no taxes but rather all the investors in taxable accounts do. Mutual
fund share prices are typically valued each day the stock or bond markets are
open and typically the value of a share is the net_asset_value of the fund
shares investors own.
*** Total returns[edit] ***
Mutual funds report total returns assuming reinvestment of dividend and capital
gain distributions. That is, the dollar amounts distributed are used to
purchase additional shares of the funds as of the reinvestment/ex-dividend
date. Reinvestment rates or factors are based on total distributions (dividends
plus capital gains) during each period.
*** Average annual total return (geometric)[edit] ***
US mutual funds are to compute average annual total return as prescribed by the
U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission (SEC) in instructions to form N-1A (the
fund prospectus) as the average annual compounded rates of return for 1-year,
5-year and 10-year periods (or inception of the fund if shorter) as the
"average annual total return" for each fund. The following formula is used:[8]
    P   (  1 + T  )   n   = E R V    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P\left(1+T\right)^
{n}=ERV} }  [\mathrm {P \left( 1 + T \right) ^ n = ERV}]
Where:
P = a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000.
T = average annual total return.
n = number of years.
ERV = ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the
beginning of the 1-, 5-, or 10-year periods at the end of the 1-, 5-, or 10-
year periods (or fractional portion).
Solving for T gives
    T =   (    E R V  P   )   1  /  n   &#x2212; 1    {\displaystyle \mathrm
{T=\left({\frac {ERV}{P}}\right)^{1/n}-1} }  [\mathrm {T = \left( \frac {ERV}
{P} \right) ^ {1 / n} - 1}]
**** Mutual fund capital gain distributions[edit] ****
Mutual funds include capital gains as well as dividends in their return
calculations. Since the market price of a mutual fund share is based on net
asset value, a capital gain distribution is offset by an equal decrease in
mutual fund share value/price. From the shareholder's perspective, a capital
gain distribution is not a net gain in assets, but it is a realized capital
gain (coupled with an equivalent decrease in unrealized capital gain).

    * After five years, an investor who reinvested all distributions would own
      91.314 shares valued at $19.90 per share. The return over the five-year
      period is $19.90 √É¬ó 91.314 / $1,000 - 1 = 81.71%
    * Geometric average annual total return with reinvestment = ($19.90 √É¬ó
      91.314 / $1,000) ^ (1 / 5) - 1 = 12.69%
    * An investor who did not reinvest would have received total distributions
      (cash payments) of $5.78 per share. The return over the five-year period
      for such an investor would be ($19.90 + $5.78) / $14.21 - 1 = 80.72%, and
      the arithmetic average rate of return would be 80.72%/5 = 16.14% per
      year.
