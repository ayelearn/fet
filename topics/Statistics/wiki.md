Statistics is a branch of mathematics working with data collection,
organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation.[1][2] In applying
statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional
to begin with a statistical_population or a statistical_model to be studied.
Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people
living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with
every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the
design of surveys and experiments.[1] See glossary_of_probability_and
statistics.
When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing
specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures
that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the
population as a whole. An experimental_study involves taking measurements of
the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional
measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has
modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational_study
does not involve experimental manipulation.
Two main statistical methods are used in data_analysis: descriptive_statistics,
which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard
deviation, and inferential_statistics, which draw conclusions from data that
are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling
variation).[3] Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of
properties of a distribution (sample or population): central_tendency (or
location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value,
while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of
the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on
mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability_theory,
which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.
A standard statistical procedure involves the test_of_the_relationship between
two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an
idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship
between the two data sets, and this is compared as an alternative to an
idealized null_hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting
or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify
the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used
in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are
recognized: Type_I_errors (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false
positive") and Type_II_errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an
actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative").[4]
Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework: ranging from
obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis.
[citation_needed]
Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.
Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but
other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect
units) can also occur. The presence of missing_data or censoring may result in
biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these
problems.
Statistics can be said to have begun in ancient civilization, going back at
least to the 5th century BC, but it was not until the 18th century that it
started to draw more heavily from calculus and probability_theory. In more
recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software to produce
tests such as descriptive analysis.[5]

***** Introduction[edit] *****
Main article: Outline_of_statistics
Some definitions are:
    * Merriam-Webster dictionary defines statistics as "a branch of mathematics
      dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation
      of masses of numerical data."[6]
    * Statistician Arthur_Lyon_Bowley defines statistics as "Numerical
      statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to
      each other."[7]
Statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection,
analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data,[8] or as a
branch of mathematics.[9] Some consider statistics to be a distinct
mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics. While many scientific
investigations make use of data, statistics is concerned with the use of data
in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty.
[10][11]
In applying statistics to a problem, it is common practice to start with a
population or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as
"all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal".
Ideally, statisticians compile data about the entire population (an operation
called census). This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes.
Descriptive_statistics can be used to summarize the population data. Numerical
descriptors include mean and standard_deviation for continuous_data types (like
income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing
categorical_data (like education).
When a census is not feasible, a chosen subset of the population called a
sample is studied. Once a sample that is representative of the population is
determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or
experimental setting. Again, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize
the sample data. However, the drawing of the sample has been subject to an
element of randomness, hence the established numerical descriptors from the
sample are also due to uncertainty. To still draw meaningful conclusions about
the entire population, inferential_statistics is needed. It uses patterns in
the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting
for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no
questions about the data (hypothesis_testing), estimating numerical
characteristics of the data (estimation), describing associations within the
data (correlation) and modeling relationships within the data (for example,
using regression_analysis). Inference can extend to forecasting, prediction and
estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population
being studied; it can include extrapolation and interpolation of time_series or
spatial_data, and can also include data_mining.
**** Mathematical statistics[edit] ****
Main article: Mathematical_statistics
Mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics.
Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical_analysis, linear
algebra, stochastic_analysis, differential_equations, and measure-theoretic
probability_theory.[12][13]
***** History[edit] *****
Gerolamo_Cardano, a pioneer on the mathematics of probability.
Main articles: History_of_statistics and Founders_of_statistics
The earliest writing on statistics was found in a 9th-century book entitled
Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages, written by Arab scholar Al-
Kindi (801â873). In his book, Al-Kindi gave a detailed description of how to
use statistics and frequency_analysis to decipher encrypted messages. This text
laid the foundations for statistics and cryptanalysis.[14][15] Al-Kindi also
made the earliest known use of statistical_inference, while he and other Arab
cryptologists developed the early statistical methods for decoding encrypted
messages. Arab_mathematicians including Al-Kindi, Al-Khalil (717â786) and Ibn
Adlan (1187â1268) used forms of probability_and_statistics, with one of Ibn
Adlan's most important contributions being on sample_size for use of frequency
analysis.[16]
The earliest European writing on statistics dates back to 1663, with the
publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality
by John_Graunt.[17] Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around
the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its
stat-_etymology. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the
early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general.
Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and
social sciences.
The mathematical foundations of modern statistics were laid in the 17th century
with the development of the probability_theory by Gerolamo_Cardano, Blaise
Pascal and Pierre_de_Fermat. Mathematical probability theory arose from the
study of games of chance, although the concept of probability was already
examined in medieval_law and by philosophers such as Juan_Caramuel.[18] The
method_of_least_squares was first described by Adrien-Marie_Legendre in 1805.
Karl_Pearson, a founder of mathematical statistics.
The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century
in three stages.[19] The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the
work of Francis_Galton and Karl_Pearson, who transformed statistics into a
rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in
industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the
concepts of standard_deviation, correlation, regression_analysis and the
application of these methods to the study of the variety of human
characteristicsâheight, weight, eyelash length among others.[20] Pearson
developed the Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient, defined as a
product-moment,[21] the method_of_moments for the fitting of distributions to
samples and the Pearson_distribution, among many other things.[22] Galton and
Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and
biostatistics (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first
university statistics department at University_College_London.[23]
Ronald_Fisher coined the term null_hypothesis during the Lady_tasting_tea
experiment, which "is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved,
in the course of experimentation".[24][25]
The second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by William_Sealy_Gosset, and
reached its culmination in the insights of Ronald_Fisher, who wrote the
textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around
the world. Fisher's most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper The
Correlation_between_Relatives_on_the_Supposition_of_Mendelian_Inheritance,
which was the first to use the statistical term, variance, his classic 1925
work Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers and his 1935 The_Design_of
Experiments,[26][27][28][29] where he developed rigorous design_of_experiments
models. He originated the concepts of sufficiency, ancillary_statistics,
Fisher's_linear_discriminator and Fisher_information.[30] In his 1930 book The
Genetical_Theory_of_Natural_Selection he applied statistics to various
biological concepts such as Fisher's_principle[31]). Nevertheless, A.W.F.
Edwards has remarked that it is "probably the most celebrated argument in
evolutionary_biology".[31] (about the sex_ratio), the Fisherian_runaway,[32]
[33][34][35][36][37] a concept in sexual_selection about a positive feedback
runaway affect found in evolution.
The final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier
developments, emerged from the collaborative work between Egon_Pearson and
Jerzy_Neyman in the 1930s. They introduced the concepts of "Type_II" error,
power of a test and confidence_intervals. Jerzy_Neyman in 1934 showed that
stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than
purposive (quota) sampling.[38]
Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision
making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for
making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology.
The use of modern computers has expedited large-scale statistical computations,
and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform
manually. Statistics continues to be an area of active research, for example on
the problem of how to analyze Big_data.[39]
***** Statistical data[edit] *****
Main article: Statistical_data
**** Data collection[edit] ****
*** Sampling[edit] ***
When full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by
developing specific experiment_designs and survey_samples. Statistics itself
also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical_models.
The idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-1600s
in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life
insurance.[40]
To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it
truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that
inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population
as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample
chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and
correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There
are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these
issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths
about the population.
Sampling theory is part of the mathematical_discipline of probability_theory.
Probability is used in mathematical_statistics to study the sampling
distributions of sample_statistics and, more generally, the properties of
statistical_procedures. The use of any statistical method is valid when the
system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the
method. The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and
sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given
parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to
samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite
directionâinductively_inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or
total population.
*** Experimental and observational studies[edit] ***
A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality,
and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values
of predictors or independent_variables_on_dependent_variables. There are two
major types of causal statistical studies: experimental_studies and
observational_studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of
an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent
variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the
study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective. An experimental study
involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the
system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to
determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In
contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental_manipulation.
Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are
investigated. While the tools of data analysis work best on data from
randomized_studies, they are also applied to other kinds of dataâlike natural
experiments and observational_studies[41]âfor which a statistician would use
a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., Difference_in_differences
estimation and instrumental_variables, among many others) that produce
consistent_estimators.
** Experiments[edit] **
The basic steps of a statistical experiment are:
   1. Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the
      study, using the following information: preliminary estimates regarding
      the size of treatment_effects, alternative_hypotheses, and the estimated
      experimental_variability. Consideration of the selection of experimental
      subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend
      that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard
      treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in
      treatment effects.
   2. Design_of_experiments, using blocking to reduce the influence of
      confounding_variables, and randomized_assignment of treatments to
      subjects to allow unbiased_estimates of treatment effects and
      experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians
      write the experimental_protocol that will guide the performance of the
      experiment and which specifies theprimary analysis of the experimental
      data.
   3. Performing the experiment following the experimental_protocol and
      analyzing_the_data following the experimental protocol.
   4. Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new
      hypotheses for future study.
   5. Documenting and presenting the results of the study.
Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous Hawthorne_study
examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the
Western_Electric_Company. The researchers were interested in determining
whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly
line workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant,
then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the
changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity
indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is
heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically
for the lack of a control_group and blindness. The Hawthorne_effect refers to
finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to
observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not
because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.[42]
** Observational study[edit] **
An example of an observational study is one that explores the association
between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to
collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical
analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both
smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a cohort_study, and then look for the
number of cases of lung cancer in each group.[43] A case-control_study is
another type of observational study in which people with and without the
outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their
exposure histories are collected.
**** Types of data[edit] ****
Main articles: Statistical_data_type and Levels_of_measurement
Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels_of_measurement.
The psychophysicist Stanley_Smith_Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval,
and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among
values, and permit any one-to-one (injective) transformation. Ordinal
measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a
meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving
transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between
measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with
longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit
any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value
and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any
rescaling transformation.
Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be
reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as
categorical_variables, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped
together as quantitative_variables, which can be either discrete or continuous,
due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely
correlated with data_type in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical
variables may be represented with the Boolean_data_type, polytomous categorical
variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral_data_type, and
continuous variables with the real_data_type involving floating_point
computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data
types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.
Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey
(1977)[44] distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and
balances. Nelder (1990)[45] described continuous counts, continuous ratios,
count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998),[46] van
den Berg (1991).[47]
The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of
statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement
procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables
and the precise interpretation of research questions. "The relationship between
the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of
statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some
transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate
depends on the question one is trying to answer" (Hand, 2004, p. 82).[48]
***** Statistical methods[edit] *****
**** Descriptive statistics[edit] ****
Main article: Descriptive_statistics
A descriptive statistic (in the count_noun sense) is a summary_statistic that
quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information,
[49] while descriptive statistics in the mass_noun sense is the process of
using and analyzing those statistics. Descriptive statistics is distinguished
from inferential_statistics (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive
statistics aims to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about
the population that the sample of data is thought to represent.
**** Inferential statistics[edit] ****
Main article: Statistical_inference
Statistical inference is the process of using data_analysis to deduce
properties of an underlying probability_distribution.[50] Inferential
statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing
hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is
sampled from a larger population. Inferential statistics can be contrasted with
descriptive_statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with
properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that
the data come from a larger population.
*** Terminology and theory of inferential statistics[edit] ***
** Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities[edit] **
Consider independent_identically_distributed_(IID)_random_variables with a
given probability_distribution: standard statistical_inference and estimation
theory defines a random_sample as the random_vector given by the column_vector
of these IID variables.[51] The population being examined is described by a
probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.
A statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but
not a function of unknown parameters. The probability distribution of the
statistic, though, may have unknown parameters.
Consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an estimator is a statistic
used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include sample_mean,
unbiased sample_variance and sample_covariance.
A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown
parameter, but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown
parameter is called a pivotal_quantity or pivot. Widely used pivots include the
z-score, the chi_square_statistic and Student's t-value.
Between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower mean_squared
error is said to be more efficient. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be
unbiased if its expected_value is equal to the true value of the unknown
parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value
converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter.
Other desirable properties for estimators include: UMVUE estimators that have
the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated
(this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and consistent
estimators which converges_in_probability to the true value of such parameter.
This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation
and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the method_of
moments, the maximum_likelihood method, the least_squares method and the more
recent method of estimating_equations.
** Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis[edit] **
Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of
a null_hypothesis which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship
exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.[52][53]
The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal
trial. The null hypothesis, H0, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas
the alternative hypothesis, H1, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The
indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H0 (status quo) stands
in opposition to H1 and is maintained unless H1 is supported by evidence
"beyond a reasonable doubt". However, "failure to reject H0" in this case does
not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict.
So the jury does not necessarily accept H0 but fails to reject H0. While one
can not "prove" a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true
with a power_test, which tests for type II errors.
What statisticians call an alternative_hypothesis is simply a hypothesis that
contradicts the null_hypothesis.
** Error[edit] **
Working from a null_hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized:
    * Type_I_errors where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a
      "false positive".
    * Type_II_errors where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an
      actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false
      negative".
Standard_deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a
sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean,
while Standard_error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean
and population mean.
A statistical_error is the amount by which an observation differs from its
expected_value, a residual is the amount an observation differs from the value
the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called
prediction).
Mean_squared_error is used for obtaining efficient_estimators, a widely used
class of estimators. Root_mean_square_error is simply the square root of mean
squared error.
A least squares fit: in red the points to be fitted, in blue the fitted line.
Many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual_sum_of_squares, and
these are called "methods_of_least_squares" in contrast to Least_absolute
deviations. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the
former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also
differentiable, which provides a handy property for doing regression. Least
squares applied to linear_regression is called ordinary_least_squares method
and least squares applied to nonlinear_regression is called non-linear_least
squares. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the
model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear
regression and non-linear regression are addressed in polynomial_least_squares,
which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y
axis) as a function of the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations
(errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.
Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.
Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but
other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect
units) can also be important. The presence of missing_data or censoring may
result in biased_estimates and specific techniques have been developed to
address these problems.[54]
** Interval estimation[edit] **
Main article: Interval_estimation
Confidence_intervals: the red line is true value for the mean in this example,
the blue lines are random confidence intervals for 100 realizations.
Most studies only sample part of a population, so results don't fully represent
the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate
the population value. Confidence_intervals allow statisticians to express how
closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population.
Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95%
confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis
were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the
interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible
cases. This does not imply that the probability that the true value is in the
confidence interval is 95%. From the frequentist perspective, such a claim does
not even make sense, as the true value is not a random_variable. Either the
true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that,
before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the
confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated
interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval
are yet-to-be-observed random_variables. One approach that does yield an
interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing
the true value is to use a credible_interval from Bayesian_statistics: this
approach depends on a different way of interpreting_what_is_meant_by
"probability", that is as a Bayesian_probability.
In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An
interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a
parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be
asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around
the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached
asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.
** Significance[edit] **
Main article: Statistical_significance
Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under
analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical
significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a
value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the p-
value).
In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the test
statistic, the critical_region is the set of values to the right of the
observed data point (observed value of the test statistic) and the p-value is
represented by the green area.
The standard approach[51] is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative
hypothesis. A critical_region is the set of values of the estimator that leads
to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore
the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that
null hypothesis is true (statistical_significance) and the probability of type
II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical
region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The statistical_power of
a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when
the null hypothesis is false.
Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the
overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large
study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant
but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the
patient noticeably.
Although in principle the acceptable level of statistical_significance may be
subject to debate, the p-value is the smallest significance level that allows
the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to
saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is
true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the test_statistic.
Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing
type I error.
Some problems are usually associated with this framework (See criticism_of
hypothesis_testing):
    * A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no
      practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests to
      account for this. One response involves going beyond reporting only the
      significance_level to include the p-value when reporting whether a
      hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not
      indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem
      to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A
      better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence
      intervals. Although these are produced from the same calculations as
      those of hypothesis tests or p-values, they describe both the size of the
      effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.
    * Fallacy of the transposed conditional, aka prosecutor's_fallacy:
      criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one
      hypothesis (the null_hypothesis) to be favored, since what is being
      evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null
      hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed
      result. An alternative to this approach is offered by Bayesian_inference,
      although it requires establishing a prior_probability.[55]
    * Rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the
      alternative hypothesis.
    * As everything in inferential_statistics it relies on sample size, and
      therefore under fat_tails p-values may be seriously mis-computed.

***** Misuse[edit] *****
Main article: Misuse_of_statistics
Misuse_of_statistics can produce subtle, but serious errors in description and
interpretationâsubtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make
such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating
decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the
reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of
statistics.
Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be
difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The statistical
significance of a trend in the dataâwhich measures the extent to which a
trend could be caused by random variation in the sampleâmay or may not agree
with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical
skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their
everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical_literacy.
There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently
intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are
favorable to the presenter.[56] A mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics
is associated with the quotation, "There_are_three_kinds_of_lies:_lies,_damned
lies,_and_statistics". Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and
intentional, and the book How_to_Lie_with_Statistics[56] outlines a range of
considerations. In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of
statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are
conducted (e.g. Warne, Lazo, Ramos, and Ritter (2012)).[57]
Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding
bias.[58] Misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to
be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or
unconsciously overlooking sampling bias.[59] Bar graphs are arguably the
easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or
with simple computer programs.[58] Unfortunately, most people do not look for
bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that
something is true even if it is not well represented.[59] To make data gathered
from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be
representative of the whole.[60] According to Huff, "The dependability of a
sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism."
[61]
To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of
questions to be asked in each case:[62]
    * Who says so? (Does he/she have an axe to grind?)
    * How does he/she know? (Does he/she have the resources to know the facts?)
    * What's missing? (Does he/she give us a complete picture?)
    * Did someone change the subject? (Does he/she offer us the right answer to
      the wrong problem?)
    * Does it make sense? (Is his/her conclusion logical and consistent with
      what we already know?)
The confounding_variable problem: X and Y may be correlated, not because there
is causal relationship between them, but because both depend on a third
variable Z. Z is called a confounding factor.
**** Misinterpretation: correlation[edit] ****
The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential
confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a data_set often reveals that
two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary
together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that
also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter
lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated;
however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation
phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon,
called a lurking variable or confounding_variable. For this reason, there is no
way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two
variables. (See Correlation_does_not_imply_causation.)
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Applied statistics, theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics
[edit] ****
Applied statistics comprises descriptive statistics and the application of
inferential statistics.[63][64] Theoretical statistics concerns the logical
arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical_inference, as
well as encompassing mathematical statistics. Mathematical statistics includes
not only the manipulation of probability_distributions necessary for deriving
results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various
aspects of computational_statistics and the design_of_experiments.
**** Machine learning and data mining[edit] ****
Machine Learning models are statistical and probabilistic models that captures
patterns in the data through use of computational algorithms.
**** Statistics in society[edit] ****
Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic_disciplines, including
natural and social_sciences, government, and business. Statistical_consultants
can help organizations and companies that don't have in-house expertise
relevant to their particular questions.
**** Statistical computing[edit] ****
gretl, an example of an open_source_statistical_package
Main article: Computational_statistics
The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second
half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of
statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class
of linear_models, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical
algorithms, caused an increased interest in nonlinear_models (such as neural
networks) as well as the creation of new types, such as generalized_linear
models and multilevel_models.
Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of
computationally intensive methods based on resampling, such as permutation
tests and the bootstrap, while techniques such as Gibbs_sampling have made use
of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for
the future of statistics with new emphasis on "experimental" and "empirical"
statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose statistical
software are now available. Examples of available software capable of complex
statistical computation include programs such as Mathematica, SAS, SPSS, and R.
**** Statistics applied to mathematics or the arts[edit] ****
Traditionally, statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi-
standardized methodology that was "required learning" in most sciences.
[citation_needed] This tradition has changed with use of statistics in non-
inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many
fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically.[according_to
whom?] Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered
essential methodology in certain areas.
    * In number_theory, scatter_plots of data generated by a distribution
      function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to
      reveal underlying patterns, which may then lead to hypotheses.
    * Methods of statistics including predictive methods in forecasting are
      combined with chaos_theory and fractal_geometry to create video works
      that are considered to have great beauty.[citation_needed]
    * The process_art of Jackson_Pollock relied on artistic experiments whereby
      underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed.[citation
      needed] With the advent of computers, statistical methods were applied to
      formalize such distribution-driven natural processes to make and analyze
      moving video art.[citation_needed]
    * Methods of statistics may be used predicatively in performance_art, as in
      a card trick based on a Markov_process that only works some of the time,
      the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology.
    * Statistics can be used to predicatively create art, as in the statistical
      or stochastic_music invented by Iannis_Xenakis, where the music is
      performance-specific. Though this type of artistry does not always come
      out as expected, it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable
      using statistics.
***** Specialized disciplines[edit] *****
Main article: List_of_fields_of_application_of_statistics
Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and
social research, including: biostatistics, computational_biology, computational
sociology, network_biology, social_science, sociology and social_research. Some
fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have
specialized_terminology. These disciplines include:
    * Actuarial_science (assesses risk in the insurance and finance industries)
    * Applied_information_economics
    * Astrostatistics (statistical evaluation of astronomical data)
    * Biostatistics
    * Business_statistics
    * Chemometrics (for analysis of data from chemistry)
    * Data_mining (applying statistics and pattern_recognition to discover
      knowledge from data)
    * Data_science
    * Demography (statistical study of populations)
    * Econometrics (statistical analysis of economic data)
    * Energy_statistics
    * Engineering_statistics
    * Epidemiology (statistical analysis of disease)
    * Geography and geographic_information_systems, specifically in spatial
      analysis
    * Image_processing
    * Medical_statistics
    * Political_science
    * Psychological_statistics
    * Reliability_engineering
    * Social_statistics
    * Statistical_mechanics
In addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also
developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:
    * Bootstrap / jackknife_resampling
    * Multivariate_statistics
    * Statistical_classification
    * Structured_data_analysis_(statistics)
    * Structural_equation_modelling
    * Survey_methodology
    * Survival_analysis
    * Statistics in various sports, particularly baseball â known as
      sabermetrics â and cricket
Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is
used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in
statistical_process_control or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-
driven decisions. In these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only
reliable tool.
