A plasma torch cutter
A plasma torch (also known as a plasma arc, plasma gun, or plasma cutter,
plasmatron) is a device for generating a directed flow of plasma.[1][2][3]
The plasma jet can be used for applications including plasma_cutting, plasma
arc_welding, plasma_spraying, and plasma_gasification for waste disposal.[4]

***** Types of thermal plasma torches[edit] *****
Thermal_plasmas are generated in plasma torches by direct_current (DC),
alternating_current (AC), radio-frequency (RF) and other discharges. DC torches
are the most commonly used and researched, because when compared to AC:
âthere is less flicker generation and noise, a more stable operation, better
control, a minimum of two electrodes, lower electrode consumption, slightly
lower refractory [heat] wear and lower power consumptionâ.[5]
**** Thermal plasma DC torches, non-transferred arc, based on hot cathode[edit]

In a DC torch, the electric_arc is formed between the electrodes (which can be
made of copper, tungsten, graphite, molybdenum, silver etc.), and the thermal
plasma is formed from the continual input of carrier/working gas, projecting
outward as a plasma jet/flame (as can be seen in the adjacent image). In DC
torches, the carrier gas can be, for example, either oxygen, nitrogen, argon,
helium, air, or hydrogen;[5] and although termed as such, it does not have to
be a gas (thus, better termed a carrier fluid).
For example, a research plasma torch at the Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP)
in Prague, Czech Republic, functions with an H2O vortex (as well as a small
addition of argon to ignite the arc), and produces a high temperature/velocity
plasma flame.[6] In fact, early studies of arc stabilization employed a water-
vortex.[7] Overall, the electrode materials and carrier fluids have to be
specifically matched to avoid excessive electrode corrosion or oxidation (and
contamination of materials to be treated), while maintaining ample power and
function.
Furthermore, the flow-rate of the carrier gas can be raised to promote a
larger, more projecting plasma jet, provided that the arc current is
sufficiently increased; and vice versa.
The plasma flame of a real plasma torch is a few inches long at most; it is to
be distinguished from fictional_long-range_plasma_weapons.
*** Transferred vs. non-transferred[edit] ***
It is important to note that there are two types of DC torches: non-transferred
and transferred. In non-transferred DC torches, the electrodes are inside the
body/housing of the torch itself (creating the arc there). Whereas in a
transferred torch one electrode is outside (and is usually the conductive
material to be treated), allowing the arc to form outside of the torch over a
larger distance.
A benefit of transferred DC torches is that the plasma arc is formed outside
the water-cooled body, preventing heat lossâas is the case with non-
transferred torches, where their electrical-to-thermal efficiency can be as low
as 50%, but the hot water can itself be utilized.[6] Furthermore, transferred
DC torches can be used in a twin-torch setup, where one torch is cathodic_and
the_other_anodic, which has the earlier benefit of a regular transferred
single-torch system, but allows their use with non-conductive materials, as
there is no need for it to form the other electrode.[5] However, these types of
setups are rare as most common non-conductive materials do not require the
precise cutting ability of a plasma torch. In addition, the discharge generated
by this particular plasma source configuration is characterized by a complex
shape and fluid dynamics that requires a 3D description in order to be
predicted, making performance unsteady. The electrodes of non-transferred
torches are larger, because they suffer more wear by the plasma arc.
The quality of plasma produced is a function of density (pressure), temperature
and torch power (the greater the better). With regards to the efficiency of the
torch itselfâthis can vary among manufacturers and torch technology; though
for example, Leal-QuirÃ³s reports that for Westinghouse Plasma Corp. torches
âa thermal efficiency of 90% is easily possible; the efficiency represents
the percentage of arc power that exits the torch and enters the processâ.[8]
