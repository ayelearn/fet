A metal (from Greek √é¬º√é¬≠√è¬Ñ√é¬±√é¬ª√é¬ª√é¬ø√é¬Ω m√É¬©tallon, "mine, quarry, metal") is a
material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or fractured, shows a lustrous
appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are
typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be
drawn into wires). A metal may be a chemical_element such as iron, or an alloy
such as stainless_steel.
In physics, a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of
conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute_zero.[1] Many elements and
compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high
pressures. For example, the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a
pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric_pressure. Equally,
some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals. Sodium, for example,
becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric
pressure.
In chemistry, two elements that would otherwise qualify (in physics) as brittle
metals√¢¬Ä¬îarsenic and antimony√¢¬Ä¬îare commonly instead recognised as metalloids,
on account of their predominately non-metallic chemistry. Around 95 of the 118
elements in the periodic_table are metals (or are likely to be such). The
number is inexact as the boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids
fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the
categories involved.
In astrophysics the term "metal" is cast more widely to refer to all chemical
elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two, hydrogen and helium,
and not just traditional metals. A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen
and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime. Used in that sense, the
metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up
of the heavier chemical elements.[2]
Metals comprise 25% of the Earth's crust and are present in many aspects of
modern life. The strength and resilience of some metals has led to their
frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as
well as most vehicles, many home_appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks.
Precious_metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era,
coinage_metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements.[3]
The history of metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000
years ago. Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise
in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the 5th millennium BCE.
Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; the
discovery of sodium√¢¬Ä¬îthe first light metal√¢¬Ä¬îin 1809; the rise of modern alloy
steels; and, since the end of World War II, the development of more
sophisticated alloys.

***** Properties *****
**** Form and structure ****
Gallium crystals
Metals are shiny and lustrous, at least when freshly prepared, polished, or
fractured. Sheets of metal thicker than a few micrometres appear opaque, but
gold_leaf transmits green light.
The solid or liquid state of metals largely originates in the capacity of the
metal atoms involved to readily lose their outer shell electrons. Broadly, the
forces holding an individual atom's outer shell electrons in place are weaker
than the attractive forces on the same electrons arising from interactions
between the atoms in the solid or liquid metal. The electrons involved become
delocalised and the atomic structure of a metal can effectively be visualised
as a collection of atoms embedded in a cloud of relatively mobile electrons.
This type of interaction is called a metallic_bond.[4] The strength of metallic
bonds for different elemental metals reaches a maximum around the center of the
transition_metal series, as these elements have large numbers of delocalized
electrons.[n_1]
Although most elemental metals have higher densities than most nonmetals,[4]
there is a wide variation in their densities, lithium being the least dense
(0.534¬†g/cm3) and osmium (22.59¬†g/cm3) the most dense. Magnesium, aluminium and
titanium are light_metals of significant commercial importance. Their
respective densities of 1.7, 2.7 and 4.5¬†g/cm3 can be compared to those of the
older structural metals, like iron at 7.9 and copper at 8.9¬†g/cm3. An iron ball
would thus weigh about as much as three aluminium balls.
A metal rod with a hot-worked eyelet. Hot-working is a technique which exploits
the capacity of the metal involved to be plastically deformed.
Metals are typically malleable and ductile, deforming under stress without
cleaving.[4] The nondirectional nature of metallic bonding is thought to
contribute significantly to the ductility of most metallic solids. In contrast,
in an ionic compound like table salt, when the planes of an ionic_bond slide
past one another, the resultant change in location shifts ions of the same
charge into close proximity, resulting in the cleavage of the crystal. Such a
shift is not observed in a covalently_bonded crystal, such as a diamond, where
fracture and crystal fragmentation occurs.[5] Reversible elastic_deformation in
metals can be described by Hooke's_Law for restoring forces, where the stress
is linearly proportional to the strain.
Heat or forces larger than a metal's elastic_limit may cause a permanent
(irreversible) deformation, known as plastic_deformation or plasticity. An
applied force may be a tensile (pulling) force, a compressive (pushing) force,
or a shear, bending or torsion (twisting) force. A temperature change may
affect the movement or displacement of structural_defects in the metal such as
grain_boundaries, point_vacancies, line_and_screw_dislocations, stacking_faults
and twins in both crystalline and non-crystalline metals. Internal slip, creep,
and metal_fatigue may ensue.
The atoms of metallic substances are typically_arranged in one of three common
crystal_structures, namely body-centered_cubic (bcc), face-centered_cubic
(fcc), and hexagonal_close-packed (hcp). In bcc, each atom is positioned at the
center of a cube of eight others. In fcc and hcp, each atom is surrounded by
twelve others, but the stacking of the layers differs. Some metals adopt
different structures depending on the temperature.[6]
    * Body-centered cubic crystal structure, with a 2-atom unit cell, as found
      in e.g. chromium, iron, and tungsten
    * Face-centered cubic crystal structure, with a 4-atom unit cell, as found
      in e.g. aluminium, copper, and gold
    * Hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with a 6-atom unit cell, as
      found in e.g. titanium, cobalt, and zinc
The unit_cell for each crystal structure is the smallest group of atoms which
has the overall symmetry of the crystal, and from which the entire crystalline
lattice can be built up by repetition in three dimensions. In the case of the
body-centered cubic crystal structure shown above, the unit cell is made up of
the central atom plus one-eight of each of the eight corner atoms.
**** Electrical and thermal ****
The energy states available to electrons in different kinds of solids at
thermodynamic_equilibrium.
¬†
Here, height is energy while width is the density_of_available_states for a
certain energy in the material listed. The shading follows the Fermi√¢¬Ä¬ìDirac
distribution (black = all states filled, white = no state filled).
¬†
The Fermi_level EF is the energy level at which the electrons are in a position
to interact with energy levels above them. In metals and semimetals the Fermi
level EF lies inside at least one band of energy states.
¬†
In insulators and semiconductors the Fermi level is inside a band_gap; however,
in semiconductors the bands are near enough to the Fermi level to be thermally
populated with electrons or holes.
The electronic structure of metals means they are relatively good conductors_of
electricity. Electrons in matter can only have fixed rather than variable
energy levels, and in a metal the energy levels of the electrons in its
electron cloud, at least to some degree, correspond to the energy levels at
which electrical conduction can occur. In a semiconductor like silicon or a
nonmetal like sulfur there is an energy gap between the electrons in the
substance and the energy level at which electrical conduction can occur.
Consequently, semiconductors and nonmetals are relatively poor conductors.
The elemental metals have electrical conductivity values of from 6.9 √É¬ó 103 S/
cm for manganese to 6.3 √É¬ó 105 S/cm for silver. In contrast, a semiconducting
metalloid such as boron has an electrical conductivity 1.5 √É¬ó 10√¢¬à¬í6 S/cm. With
one exception, metallic elements reduce their electrical conductivity when
heated. Plutonium increases its electrical conductivity when heated in the
temperature range of around √¢¬à¬í175 to +125¬†√Ç¬∞C.
Metals are relatively good conductors_of_heat. The electrons in a metal's
electron cloud are highly mobile and easily able to pass on heat-induced
vibrational energy.
The contribution of a metal's electrons to its heat capacity and thermal
conductivity, and the electrical conductivity of the metal itself can be
calculated from the free_electron_model, albeit this does not take into account
the detailed structure of the metal's ion lattice. Taking into account the
positive potential caused by the arrangement of the ion cores enables
consideration of the electronic_band_structure and binding_energy of a metal.
Various mathematical models are applicable, the simplest being the nearly_free
electron_model.
**** Chemical ****
Metals are usually inclined to form cations through electron loss.[4] Most will
react with oxygen in the air to form oxides over various timescales (potassium
burns in seconds while iron rusts over years). Some others, like palladium,
platinum and gold, do not react with the atmosphere at all. The oxides of
metals are generally basic, as opposed to those of nonmetals, which are acidic
or neutral. Exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation_states such
as CrO3, Mn2O7, and OsO4, which have strictly acidic reactions.
Painting, anodizing or plating metals are good ways to prevent their corrosion.
However, a more reactive metal in the electrochemical_series must be chosen for
coating, especially when chipping of the coating is expected. Water and the two
metals form an electrochemical_cell, and if the coating is less reactive than
the underlying metal, the coating actually promotes corrosion.
***** Periodic table distribution *****
In chemistry, the elements which are usually considered to be metals under
ordinary conditions are shown in yellow on the periodic table below. The
elements shown as having unknown properties are likely to be metals. The
remaining elements are either metalloids (B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, and Te being
commonly recognised as such) or nonmetals. Astatine (At) is usually classified
as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; it has been predicted to be a metal. It is
here shown as a metalloid.

***** Alloys *****
Main article: Alloy
Samples of babbitt_metal, an alloy of tin, antimony and copper, used in
bearings to reduce friction
An alloy is a substance having metallic properties and which is composed of two
or more elements at least one of which is a metal. An alloy may have a variable
or fixed composition. For example, gold and silver form an alloy in which the
proportions of gold or silver can be freely adjusted; titanium and silicon form
an alloy Ti2Si in which the ratio of the two components is fixed (also known as
an intermetallic_compound).
A sculpture cast in nickel_silver√¢¬Ä¬îan alloy of copper, nickel, and zinc that

Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for
practical use. Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the
properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics. The aim of
making alloys is generally to make them less brittle, harder, resistant to
corrosion, or have a more desirable color and luster. Of all the metallic
alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless_steel, cast_iron,
tool_steel, alloy_steel) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and
commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low,
mid and high carbon steels, with increasing carbon levels reducing ductility
and toughness. The addition of silicon will produce cast irons, while the
addition of chromium, nickel and molybdenum to carbon steels (more than 10%)
results in stainless steels.
Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium, titanium, copper and
magnesium. Copper alloys have been known since prehistory√¢¬Ä¬îbronze gave the
Bronze_Age its name√¢¬Ä¬îand have many applications today, most importantly in
electrical wiring. The alloys of the other three metals have been developed
relatively recently; due to their chemical reactivity they require electrolytic
extraction processes. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are
valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios; magnesium can also provide
electromagnetic_shielding.[citation_needed] These materials are ideal for
situations where high strength-to-weight ratio is more important than material
cost, such as in aerospace and some automotive applications.
Alloys specially designed for highly demanding applications, such as jet
engines, may contain more than ten elements.

Metals can be categorised according to their physical or chemical properties.
Categories described in the subsections below include ferrous and non-ferrous
metals; brittle metals and refractory_metals; heavy and light metals; and base,
noble, and precious metals. The Metallic elements table in this section
categorises the elemental metals on the basis of their chemical properties into
alkali and alkaline_earth metals; transition and post-transition metals; and
lanthanides and actinides. Other_categories are possible, depending on the
criteria for inclusion. For example, the ferromagnetic metals√¢¬Ä¬îthose metals
that are magnetic at room temperature√¢¬Ä¬îare iron, cobalt, and nickel.
**** Ferrous and non-ferrous metals ****
Main articles: Ferrous_metallurgy and Non-ferrous_metals
The term "ferrous" is derived from the Latin word meaning "containing iron".
This can include pure iron, such as wrought_iron, or an alloy such as steel.
Ferrous metals are often magnetic, but not exclusively. Non-ferrous
metals√¢¬Ä¬îalloys√¢¬Ä¬îlack appreciable amounts of iron.
**** Brittle metal ****
While nearly all metals are malleable or ductile, a few√¢¬Ä¬îberyllium, chromium,
manganese, gallium, and bismuth√¢¬Ä¬îare brittle.[7] Arsenic, and antimony, if
admitted as metals, are brittle. Low values of the ratio of bulk elastic
modulus to shear_modulus (Pugh's_criterion) are indicative of intrinsic
brittleness.
**** Refractory metal ****
Main article: Refractory_metal
In materials science, metallurgy, and engineering, a refractory metal is a
metal that is extraordinarily resistant to heat and wear. Which metals belong
to this category varies; the most common definition includes niobium,
molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium. They all have melting points above
2000¬†√Ç¬∞C, and a high hardness at room temperature.

      tarnish, and a 1¬†cm3 tungsten cube for comparison
    * Rhenium single crystal, a remelted bar, and a 1¬†cm3 rhenium cube for
      comparison
**** White metal ****
A white_metal is any of range of white-coloured metals (or their alloys) with
relatively low melting points. Such metals include zinc, cadmium, tin, antimony
(here counted as a metal), lead, and bismuth, some of which are quite toxic. In
Britain, the fine art trade uses the term "white metal" in auction catalogues
to describe foreign silver items which do not carry British Assay Office marks,
but which are nonetheless understood to be silver and are priced accordingly.
**** Heavy and light metals ****
Main articles: Heavy_metals and Light_metals
A heavy metal is any relatively dense metal or metalloid.[8] More specific
definitions have been proposed, but none have obtained widespread acceptance.
Some heavy metals have niche uses, or are notably toxic; some are essential in
trace amounts. All other metals are light metals.
**** Base, noble and precious metals ****
Main articles: Base_metal, noble_metal, and precious_metal
In chemistry, the term base metal is used informally to refer to a metal that
is easily oxidized or corroded, such as reacting easily with dilute
hydrochloric_acid (HCl) to form a metal chloride and hydrogen. Examples include
iron, nickel, lead and zinc. Copper is considered a base metal as it is
oxidized relatively easily, although it does not react with HCl.
Rhodium, a noble_metal, shown here as 1g of powder, a 1g pressed cylinder, and
a 1g pellet.
The term noble_metal is commonly used in opposition to base metal. Noble metals
are resistant to corrosion or oxidation,[9] unlike most base_metals. They tend
to be precious metals, often due to perceived rarity. Examples include gold,
platinum, silver, rhodium, iridium and palladium.
In alchemy and numismatics, the term base metal is contrasted with precious
metal, that is, those of high economic value.[10] A longtime goal of the
alchemists was the transmutation of base metals into precious metals including
such coinage_metals as silver and gold. Most coins today are made of base
metals with no_intrinsic_value, in the past, coins frequently derived their
value primarily from their precious_metal content.
Chemically, the precious metals (like the noble metals) are less reactive than
most elements, have high luster and high electrical conductivity. Historically,
precious metals were important as currency, but are now regarded mainly as
investment and industrial commodities. Gold, silver, platinum and palladium
each have an ISO_4217 currency code. The best-known precious metals are gold
and silver. While both have industrial uses, they are better known for their
uses in art, jewelry, and coinage. Other precious metals include the platinum
group metals: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum, of
which platinum is the most widely traded.
The demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use, but
also by their role as investments and a store_of_value.[11] Palladium and
platinum, as of fall 2018, were valued at about three quarters the price of
gold. Silver is substantially less expensive than these metals, but is often
traditionally considered a precious metal in light of its role in coinage and
jewelry.

Metals left of the dividing line occur (or are sourced) mainly as
lithophiles; those to the right, as chalcophiles except gold (a
siderophile) and tin (a lithophile).
      This sub-section deals with the formation of periodic table elemental
      metals since these form the basis of metallic materials, as defined in
      this article.
Metals up to the vicinity_of_iron (in the periodic table) are largely made via
stellar_nucleosynthesis. In this process, lighter elements from hydrogen to
silicon undergo successive fusion reactions inside stars, releasing light and
heat and forming heavier elements with higher atomic numbers.[12]
Heavier metals are not usually formed this way since fusion reactions involving
such nuclei would consume rather than release energy.[13] Rather, they are
largely synthesised (from elements with a lower atomic number) by neutron
capture, with the two main modes of this repetitive capture being the s-process
and the r-process. In the s-process ("s" stands for "slow"), singular captures
are separated by years or decades, allowing the less stable nuclei to beta
decay,[14] while in the r-process ("rapid"), captures happen faster than nuclei
can decay. Therefore, the s-process takes a more or less clear path: for
example, stable cadmium-110 nuclei are successively bombarded by free neutrons
inside a star until they form cadmium-115 nuclei which are unstable and decay
to form indium-115 (which is nearly stable, with a half-life 30000 times the
age of the universe). These nuclei capture neutrons and form indium-116, which
is unstable, and decays to form tin-116, and so on.[12][15][n_3] In contrast,
there is no such path in the r-process. The s-process stops at bismuth due to
the short half-lives of the next two elements, polonium and astatine, which
decay to bismuth or lead. The r-process is so fast it can skip this zone of
instability and go on to create heavier elements such as thorium and uranium.
[17]
Metals condense in planets as a result of stellar evolution and destruction
processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their
lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter as a result of a neutron_star merger,[18][n
4] thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the
interstellar_medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to
coalesce and collapse new_stars_and_planets_are_formed.[20]
**** Abundance and occurrence ****

A sample of diaspore, an aluminium oxide hydroxide mineral, √é¬±-AlO(OH)
The Earth's crust is made of approximately 25% of metals by weight, of which
80% are light metals such as sodium, magnesium, and aluminium. Nonmetals (~75%)
make up the rest of the crust. Despite the overall scarcity of some heavier
metals such as copper, they can become concentrated in economically extractable
quantities as a result of mountain building, erosion, or other geological
processes.
Metals are primarily found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-
loving). Lithophile metals are mainly the s-block elements, the more reactive
of the d-block elements. and the f-block elements. They have a strong affinity
for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals.
Chalcophile metals are mainly the less reactive d-block elements, and the
period 4√¢¬Ä¬ì6 p-block metals. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide
minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust
at the time of its solidification, the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant
than the lithophiles.
On the other hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not
readily form compounds with either oxygen or sulfur. At the time of the Earth's
formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due
to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a
relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble metals√¢¬Ä¬îmolybdenum, rhenium,
the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and
platinum), germanium, and tin√¢¬Ä¬îcan be counted as siderophiles but only in
terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather
the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities,
chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).[n_5]
The rotating fluid outer core of the Earth's interior, which is composed mostly
of iron, is thought to be the source of Earth's protective magnetic field.[n_6]
The core lies above Earth's solid inner core and below its mantle. If it could
be rearranged into a column having a 5m2 footprint it would have a height of
nearly 700 light years. The magnetic field shields the Earth from the charged
particles of the solar wind, and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away
the upper atmosphere (including the ozone layer that limits the transmission of
ultraviolet radiation).
**** Extraction ****
Main articles: Ore, Mining, and Extractive_metallurgy
Metals are often extracted from the Earth by means of mining ores that are rich
sources of the requisite elements, such as bauxite. Ore is located by
prospecting techniques, followed by the exploration and examination of
deposits. Mineral sources are generally divided into surface_mines, which are
mined by excavation using heavy equipment, and subsurface_mines. In some cases,
the sale price of the metal/s involved make it economically feasible to mine
lower concentration sources.
Once the ore is mined, the metals must be extracted, usually by chemical or
electrolytic reduction. Pyrometallurgy uses high temperatures to convert ore
into raw metals, while hydrometallurgy employs aqueous chemistry for the same
purpose. The methods used depend on the metal and their contaminants.
When a metal ore is an ionic compound of that metal and a non-metal, the ore
must usually be smelted√¢¬Ä¬îheated with a reducing agent√¢¬Ä¬îto extract the pure
metal. Many common metals, such as iron, are smelted using carbon as a reducing
agent. Some metals, such as aluminium and sodium, have no commercially
practical reducing agent, and are extracted using electrolysis instead.[21][22]
Sulfide ores are not reduced directly to the metal but are roasted in air to
convert them to oxides.
**** Uses ****

Metals are present in nearly all aspects of modern life. Iron, a heavy_metal,
may be the most common as it accounts for 90% of all refined metals; aluminium,
a light_metal, is the next most commonly refined metal. Pure iron may be the
cheapest metallic element of all at cost of about US$0.07 per gram. Its ores
are widespread; it is easy to refine; and the technology involved has been
developed over hundreds of years. Cast_iron is even cheaper, at a fraction of
US$0.01 per gram, because there is no need for subsequent purification.
Platinum, at a cost of about $27 per gram, may be the most ubiquitous given its
very high melting point, resistance to corrosion, electrical conductivity, and
durability. It is said to be found in, or used to produce, 20% of all consumer
goods. Polonium is likely to be the most expensive metal, at a notional cost of
about $100,000,000 per gram,[citation_needed] due to its scarcity and micro-
scale production.
Some metals and metal alloys possess high structural strength per unit mass,
making them useful materials for carrying large loads or resisting impact
damage. Metal alloys can be engineered to have high resistance to shear, torque
and deformation. However the same metal can also be vulnerable to fatigue
damage through repeated use or from sudden stress failure when a load capacity
is exceeded. The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent
use in high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles,
many appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks.
Metals are good conductors, making them valuable in electrical appliances and
for carrying an electric current over a distance with little energy lost.
Electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity. Home
electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good
conducting properties.
The thermal conductivity of metals is useful for containers to heat materials
over a flame. Metals are also used for heat_sinks to protect sensitive
equipment from overheating.
The high reflectivity of some metals enables their use in mirrors, including
precision astronomical instruments, and adds to the aesthetics of metallic
jewelry.
Some metals have specialized uses; mercury is a liquid at room temperature and
is used in switches to complete a circuit when it flows over the switch
contacts. Radioactive metals such as uranium and plutonium are used in nuclear
power_plants to produce energy via nuclear_fission. Shape_memory_alloys are
used for applications such as pipes, fasteners and vascular stents.
Metals can be doped with foreign molecules√¢¬Ä¬îorganic, inorganic, biological and
polymers. This doping entails the metal with new properties that are induced by
the guest molecules. Applications in catalysis, medicine, electrochemical
cells, corrosion and more have been developed.[23]
**** Recycling ****
A pile of compacted steel scraps, ready for recycling
Demand for metals is closely linked to economic growth given their use in
infrastructure, construction, manufacturing, and consumer goods. During the
20th century, the variety of metals used in society grew rapidly. Today, the
development of major nations, such as China and India, and technological
advances, are fuelling ever more demand. The result is that mining activities
are expanding, and more and more of the world's metal stocks are above ground
in use, rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in-use
stock of copper. Between 1932 and 1999, copper in use in the U.S. rose from 73g
to 238g per person.[24]
Metals are inherently recyclable, so in principle, can be used over and over
again, minimizing these negative environmental impacts and saving energy. For
example, 95% of the energy used to make aluminium from bauxite ore is saved by
using recycled material.[25]
Globally, metal recycling is generally low. In 2010, the International_Resource
Panel, hosted by the United_Nations_Environment_Programme published reports on
metal stocks that exist within society[26] and their recycling rates.[24] The
authors of the report observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as
huge mines above ground. They warned that the recycling rates of some rare
metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid
cars and fuel cells are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates
are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for
use in modern technology.
***** Biological interactions *****
      See also: Mineral_(nutrient); Metal_toxicity
Some metals are either essential nutrients (typically iron, cobalt, and zinc),
or relatively harmless (such as ruthenium, silver, and indium), but can be
toxic in larger amounts or certain forms. Other metals, such as cadmium,
mercury, and lead, are highly poisonous. Potential sources of metal poisoning
include mining, tailings, industrial_wastes, agricultural_runoff, occupational
exposure, paints and treated_timber.
***** History *****
**** Prehistory ****
Copper, which occurs in native form, may have been the first metal discovered
given its distinctive appearance, heaviness, and malleability compared to other
stones or pebbles. Gold, silver, and iron (as meteoric iron), and lead were
likewise discovered in prehistory. Forms of brass, an alloy of copper and zinc
made by concurrently smelting the ores of these metals, originate from this
period (although pure zinc was not isolated until the 13th century). The
malleability of the solid metals led to the first attempts to craft metal
ornaments, tools, and weapons. Meteoric iron containing nickel was discovered
from time to time and, in some respects this was superior to any industrial
steel manufactured up to the 1880s when alloy steels become prominent.[citation

The discovery of bronze (an alloy of copper with arsenic or tin) enabled people
to create metal objects which were harder and more durable than previously
possible. Bronze tools, weapons, armor, and building_materials such as
decorative tiles were harder and more durable than their stone and copper
("Chalcolithic") predecessors. Initially, bronze was made of copper and arsenic
(forming arsenic_bronze) by smelting naturally or artificially mixed ores of
copper and arsenic.[27] The earliest artifacts so far known come from the
Iranian_plateau in the 5th millennium BCE.[28] It was only later that tin was
used, becoming the major non-copper ingredient of bronze in the late 3rd
millennium BCE.[29] Pure tin itself was first isolated in 1800 BCE by Chinese
and Japanese metalworkers.
Mercury was known to ancient Chinese and Indians before 2000¬†BCE, and found in
Egyptian tombs dating from 1500 BCE.
The earliest known production of steel, an iron-carbon alloy, is seen in pieces
of ironware excavated from an archaeological_site in Anatolia (Kaman-
Kaleh√É¬∂y√É¬ºk) and are nearly 4,000 years old, dating from 1800 BCE.[30][31]
From about 500 BCE sword-makers of Toledo,_Spain were making early forms of
alloy_steel by adding a mineral called wolframite, which contained tungsten and
manganese, to iron ore (and carbon). The resulting Toledo_steel came to the
attention of Rome when used by Hannibal in the Punic_Wars. It soon became the
basis for the weaponry of Roman legions; their swords were said to have been
"so keen that there is no helmet which cannot be cut through by them."[citation
needed][n_8]
In_pre-Columbian_America, objects made of tumbaga, an alloy of copper and gold,
started being produced in Panama and Costa Rica between 300√¢¬Ä¬ì500 CE. Small
metal sculptures were common and an extensive range of tumbaga (and gold)
ornaments comprised the usual regalia of persons of high status.
At around the same time indigenous Ecuadorians were combining gold with a
naturally-occurring platinum alloy containing small amounts of palladium,
rhodium, and iridium, to produce miniatures and masks composed of a white gold-
platinum alloy. The metal workers involved heated gold with grains of the
platinum alloy until the gold melted at which point the platinum group metals
became bound within the gold. After cooling, the resulting conglomeration was
hammered and reheated repeatedly until it became as homogenous as if all of the
metals concerned had been melted together (attaining the melting points of the
platinum group metals concerned was beyond the technology of the day).[32][n_9]

**** Middle Ages ****
Gold is for the mistress√¢¬Ä¬îsilver for the maid√¢¬Ä¬î
Copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade.
"Good!" said the Baron, sitting in his hall,
"But Iron√¢¬Ä¬îCold Iron√¢¬Ä¬îis master of them all."
from Cold_Iron by Rudyard_Kipling[33]
Arabic and medieval alchemists believed that all metals and matter were
composed of the principle of sulfur, the father of all metals and carrying the
combustible property, and the principle of mercury, the mother of all metals[n
10] and carrier of the liquidity, fusibility, and volatility properties. These
principles were not necessarily the common substances sulfur and mercury found
in most laboratories. This theory reinforced the belief that all metals were
destined to become gold in the bowels of the earth through the proper
combinations of heat, digestion, time, and elimination of contaminants, all of
which could be developed and hastened through the knowledge and methods of
alchemy.[n_11]
Arsenic, zinc, antimony, and bismuth became known, although these were at first
called semimetals or bastard metals on account of their immalleability. All
four may have been used incidentally in earlier times without recognising their
nature. Albertus_Magnus is believed to have been the first to isolate arsenic
from a compound in 1250, by heating soap together with arsenic_trisulfide.
Metallic zinc, which is brittle if impure, was isolated in India by 1300 AD.
The first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the 1540 book
De_la_pirotechnia by Vannoccio_Biringuccio. Bismuth was described by Agricola
in De_Natura_Fossilium (c. 1546); it had been confused in early times with tin
and lead because of its resemblance to those elements.

The first systematic text on the arts of mining and metallurgy was De_la
Pirotechnia (1540) by Vannoccio_Biringuccio, which treats the examination,
fusion, and working of metals.
Sixteen years later, Georgius_Agricola published De_Re_Metallica in 1556, a
clear and complete account of the profession of mining, metallurgy, and the
accessory arts and sciences, as well as qualifying as the greatest treatise on
the chemical industry through the sixteenth century.
He gave the following description of a metal in his De_Natura_Fossilium (1546):
     Metal is a mineral body, by nature either liquid or somewhat hard.
     The latter may be melted by the heat of the fire, but when it has
     cooled down again and lost all heat, it becomes hard again and
     resumes its proper form. In this respect it differs from the stone
     which melts in the fire, for although the latter regain its hardness,
     yet it loses its pristine form and properties.
     Traditionally there are six different kinds of metals, namely gold,
     silver, copper, iron, tin and lead. There are really others, for
     quicksilver is a metal, although the Alchemists disagree with us on
     this subject, and bismuth is also. The ancient Greek writers seem to
     have been ignorant of bismuth, wherefore Ammonius rightly states that
     there are many species of metals, animals, and plants which are
     unknown to us. Stibium when smelted in the crucible and refined has
     as much right to be regarded as a proper metal as is accorded to lead
     by writers. If when smelted, a certain portion be added to tin, a
     bookseller's alloy is produced from which the type is made that is
     used by those who print books on paper.
     Each metal has its own form which it preserves when separated from
     those metals which were mixed with it. Therefore neither electrum nor
     Stannum [not meaning our tin] is of itself a real metal, but rather
     an alloy of two metals. Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver,
     Stannum of lead and silver. And yet if silver be parted from the
     electrum, then gold remains and not electrum; if silver be taken away
     from Stannum, then lead remains and not Stannum.
     Whether brass, however, is found as a native metal or not, cannot be
     ascertained with any surety. We only know of the artificial brass,
     which consists of copper tinted with the colour of the mineral
     calamine. And yet if any should be dug up, it would be a proper
     metal. Black and white copper seem to be different from the red kind.
     Metal, therefore, is by nature either solid, as I have stated, or
     fluid, as in the unique case of quicksilver.
     But enough now concerning the simple kinds.[34]
Platinum, the third precious metal after gold and silver, was discovered in
Ecuador during the period 1736 to 1744, by the Spanish astronomer Antonio de
Ulloa and his colleague the mathematician Jorge Juan y Santacilia. Ulloa was
the first person to write a scientific description of the metal, in 1748.
In 1789, the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth was able to isolate an
oxide of uranium, which he thought was the metal itself. Klaproth was
subsequently credited as the discoverer of uranium. It was not until 1841, that
the French chemist Eug√É¬®ne-Melchior P√É¬©ligot, was able to prepare the first
sample of uranium metal. Henri Becquerel subsequently discovered radioactivity
in 1896 by using uranium.
In the 1790s, Joseph Priestley and the Dutch chemist Martinus van Marum
observed the transformative action of metal surfaces on the dehydrogenation of
alcohol, a development which subsequently led, in 1831, to the industrial scale
synthesis of sulphuric acid using a platinum catalyst.
In 1803, cerium was the first of the lanthanide metals to be discovered, in
Bastn√É¬§s, Sweden by J√É¬∂ns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, and
independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. The lanthanide metals
were largely regarded as oddities until the 1960s when methods were developed
to more efficiently separate them from one another. They have subsequently
found uses in cell phones, magnets, lasers, lighting, batteries, catalytic
converters, and in other applications enabling modern technologies.
Other metals discovered and prepared during this time were cobalt, nickel,
manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, and chromium; and some of the platinum_group
metals, palladium, osmium, iridium, and rhodium.
**** Light metals ****
All metals discovered until 1809 had relatively high densities; their heaviness
was regarded as a singularly distinguishing criterion. From 1809 onwards, light
metals such as sodium, potassium, and strontium were isolated. Their low
densities challenged conventional wisdom as to the nature of metals. They
behaved chemically as metals however, and were subsequently recognised as such.
Aluminium was discovered in 1824 but it was not until 1886 that an industrial
large-scale production method was developed. Prices of aluminium dropped and
aluminium became widely used in jewelry, everyday items, eyeglass frames,
optical instruments, tableware, and foil in the 1890s and early 20th century.
Aluminium's ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided
the metal many uses at the time. During World War I, major governments demanded
large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes. The most common metal
in use for electric power transmission today is aluminium_conductor_steel
reinforced. Also seeing much use is all-aluminum-alloy_conductor. Aluminium is
used because it has about half the weight of a comparable resistance copper
cable (though larger diameter due to lower specific_conductivity), as well as
being cheaper. Copper was more popular in the past and is still in use,
especially at lower voltages and for grounding.
While pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 it was not used
outside the laboratory until 1932. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union
pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications as part of
programs related to the Cold War. Starting in the early 1950s, titanium came
into use extensively in military aviation, particularly in high-performance
jets, starting with aircraft such as the F-100_Super_Sabre and Lockheed_A-12
and SR-71.
Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937. The first pound of
99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of aluminium-scandium
alloys began in 1971 following a U.S. patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were
also developed in the USSR.

**** The age of steel ****

Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation, in Brackenridge, Pennsylvania
The modern era in steelmaking began with the introduction of Henry_Bessemer's
Bessemer_process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. His method
let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild_steel came to be
used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-
Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the Bessemer
process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove
phosphorus.
Due to its high tensile_strength and low cost, steel came to be a major
component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles,
machines, appliances, and weapons.
In 1872, the Englishmen Clark and Woods patented an alloy that would today be
considered a stainless steel. The corrosion resistance of iron-chromium alloys
had been recognized in 1821 by French metallurgist¬†Pierre Berthier. He noted
their resistance against attack by some acids and suggested their use
in¬†cutlery. Metallurgists of the 19th century were unable to produce the
combination of low carbon and high chromium found in most modern stainless
steels, and the high-chromium alloys they could produce were too brittle to be
practical. It was not until 1912 that the industrialisation of stainless steel
alloys occurred in England, Germany, and the United States.
**** The last stable metallic elements ****
By 1900 three metals with atomic_numbers less than lead (#82), the heaviest
stable metal, remained to be discovered: elements 71, 72, 75.
Von Welsbach, in 1906, proved that the old ytterbium also contained a new
element (#71), which he named cassiopeium. Urbain proved this simultaneously,
but his samples were very impure and only contained trace quantities of the new
element. Despite this, his chosen name lutetium was adopted.
In 1908, Ogawa found element 75 in thorianite but assigned it as element 43
instead of 75 and named it nipponium. In 1925 Walter Noddack, Ida Eva Tacke and
Otto Berg announced its separation from gadolinite and gave it the present
name, rhenium.
Georges Urbain claimed to have found element 72 in rare-earth residues, while
Vladimir Vernadsky independently found it in orthite. Neither claim was
confirmed due to World War I, and neither could be confirmed later, as the
chemistry they reported does not match that now known for hafnium. After the
war, in 1922, Coster and Hevesy found it by X-ray spectroscopic analysis in
Norwegian zircon. Hafnium was thus the last stable element to be discovered.
    * Lutetium, including a 1¬†cm3 cube
    * Rhenium, including a 1¬†cm3 cube

By the end of World War II scientists had synthesized four post-uranium
elements, all of which are radioactive (unstable) metals: neptunium (in 1940),
plutonium (1940√¢¬Ä¬ì41), and curium and americium (1944), representing elements
93 to 96. The first two of these were eventually found in nature as well.
Curium and americium were by-products of the Manhattan project, which produced
the world's first atomic bomb in 1945. The bomb was based on the nuclear
fission of uranium, a metal first thought to have been discovered nearly 150
years earlier.
**** Post-World War II developments ****
*** Superalloys ***
Superalloys composed of combinations of Fe, Ni, Co, and Cr, and lesser amounts
of W, Mo, Ta, Nb, Ti, and Al were developed shortly after World War II for use
in high performance engines, operating at elevated temperatures (above 650¬†√Ç¬∞C
(1,200¬†√Ç¬∞F)). They retain most of their strength under these conditions, for
prolonged periods, and combine good low-temperature ductility with resistance
to corrosion or oxidation. Superalloys can now be found in a wide range of
applications including land, maritime, and aerospace turbines, and chemical and
petroleum plants.
*** Transcurium metals ***
The successful development of the atomic bomb at the end of World War II
sparked further efforts to synthesize new elements, nearly all of which are, or
are expected to be, metals, and all of which are radioactive. It was not until
1949 that element 97 (berkelium), next after element 96 (curium), was
synthesized by firing alpha particles at an americium target. In 1952, element
100 (fermium) was found in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion;
hydrogen, a nonmetal, had been identified as an element nearly 200 years
earlier. Since 1952, elements 101 (mendelevium) to 117 (tennessine) have been
synthesized. The most recently synthesized element is 118 (oganneson). Its
status as a metal or a nonmetal√¢¬Ä¬îor something else√¢¬Ä¬îis not yet clear.
*** Bulk metallic glasses ***
A metallic glass (also known as an amorphous or glassy metal) is a solid
metallic material, usually an alloy, with disordered atomic-scale structure.
Most pure and alloyed metals, in their solid state, have atoms arranged in a
highly ordered crystalline structure. Amorphous metals have a non-crystalline
glass-like structure. But unlike common glasses, such as window glass, which
are typically electrical insulators, amorphous metals have good electrical
conductivity. Amorphous metals are produced in several ways, including
extremely rapid cooling, physical vapor deposition, solid-state reaction, ion
irradiation, and mechanical alloying. The first reported metallic glass was an
alloy (Au75Si25) produced at Caltech in 1960. More recently, batches of
amorphous steel with three times the strength of conventional steel alloys have
been produced. Currently the most important applications rely on the special
magnetic properties of some ferromagnetic metallic glasses. The low
magnetization loss is used in high efficiency transformers. Theft control ID
tags and other article surveillance schemes often use metallic glasses because
of these magnetic properties.
*** Shape-memory alloys ***
A shape-memory alloy (SMA) is an alloy that "remembers" its original shape and
when deformed returns to its pre-deformed shape when heated. While the shape
memory effect had been first observed in 1932, in an Au-Cd alloy, it was not
until 1962, with the accidental discovery of the effect in a Ni-Ti alloy that
research began in earnest, and another ten years before commercial applications
emerged. SMA's have applications in robotics and automotive, aerospace and
biomedical industries. There is another type of SMA, called a ferromagnetic
shape-memory alloy (FSMA), that changes shape under strong magnetic fields.
These materials are of particular interest as the magnetic response tends to be
faster and more efficient than temperature-induced responses.
*** Quasicyrstalline alloys ***
A Ho-Mg-Zn icosahedral quasicrystal formed as a pentagonal dodecahedron, the
dual of the icosahedron.
In 1984, Israeli chemist Dan Shechtman found an aluminium-manganese alloy
having five-fold symmetry, in breach of crystallographic convention at the time
which said that crystalline structures could only have two-, three-, four-, or
six-fold symmetry. ¬†Due to fear of the scientific community's reaction, it took
him two years to publish the results¬†for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry in 2011. Since this time, hundreds of quasicrystals have been
reported and confirmed. They exist in many metallic alloys (and some polymers).
Quasicrystals are found most often in aluminium alloys (Al-Li-Cu, Al-Mn-Si, Al-
Ni-Co, Al-Pd-Mn, Al-Cu-Fe, Al-Cu-V, etc.), but numerous other compositions are
also known (Cd-Yb, Ti-Zr-Ni, Zn-Mg-Ho, Zn-Mg-Sc, In-Ag-Yb, Pd-U-Si, etc.).
Quasicrystals effectively have infinitely large unit cells. Icosahedrite
Al63Cu24Fe13, the first quasicrystal found in nature, was discovered in 2009.
Most quasicrystals have ceramic-like properties including low electrical
conductivity (approaching values seen in insulators) and low thermal
conductivity, high hardness, brittleness, and resistance to corrosion, and non-
stick properties. Quasicrystals have been used to develop heat
insulation,¬†LEDs, diesel engines, and new materials that convert heat to
electricity. New applications may take advantage of the low coefficient of
friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials, for example
embedding particles in plastic to make strong, hard-wearing, low-friction
plastic gears. Other potential applications include selective solar absorbers
for power conversion, broad-wavelength reflectors, and bone repair and
prostheses applications where biocompatibility, low friction and corrosion
resistance are required.
*** Complex metallic alloys ***
Complex_metallic_alloys (CMAs) are intermetallic compounds characterized by
large unit cells comprising some tens up to thousands of atoms; the presence of
well-defined clusters of atoms (frequently with icosahedral symmetry); and
partial disorder within their crystalline lattices. They are composed of two or
more metallic elements, sometimes with metalloids or chalcogenides added. They
include, for example, NaCd2, with 348 sodium atoms and 768 cadmium atoms in the
unit cell. Linus_Pauling attempted to describe the structure of NaCd2 in 1923,
but did not succeed until 1955. At first called "giant unit cell crystals",
interest in CMAs, as they came to be called, did not pick up until 2002, with
the publication of a paper called "Structurally Complex Alloy Phases", given at
the 8th International Conference on Quasicrystals. Potential applications of
CMAs include as heat insulation; solar heating; magnetic refrigerators; using
waste heat to generate electricity; and coatings for turbine blades in military
engines.
*** High entropy alloys ***
High_entropy_alloys (HEAs) such as AlLiMgScTi are composed of equal or nearly
equal quantities of five or more metals. Compared to conventional alloys with
only one or two base metals, HEAs have considerably better strength-to-weight
ratios, higher tensile strength, and greater resistance to fracturing,
corrosion, and oxidation. Although HEAs were described as early as 1981,
significant interest did not develop until the 2010s; they continue to be the
focus of research in materials science and engineering because of their
potential for desirable properties.
*** MAX phase alloys ***
   MAX phase
alloy examples
MAX     M  A  X
Hf2SnC  Hf Sn C
Ti4AlN3 Ti Al N
Ti3SiC2 Ti Si C
Ti2AlC  Ti Al C
Cr2AlC2 Cr Al C
Ti3AlC2 Ti Al C
In a MAX_phase_alloy, M is an early transition metal, A is an A group element
(mostly group IIIA and IVA, or groups 13 and 14), and X is either carbon or
nitrogen. Examples are Hf2SnC and Ti4AlN3. Such alloys have some of the best
properties of metals and ceramics. These properties include high electrical and
thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, damage tolerance,
machinability, high elastic stiffness, and low thermal expansion coefficients.
[35] They can be polished to a metallic luster because of their excellent
electrical conductivities. During mechanical testing, it has been found that
polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 cylinders can be repeatedly compressed at room
temperature, up to stresses of 1 GPa, and fully recover upon the removal of the
load. Some MAX phases are also highly resistant to chemical attack (e.g.
Ti3SiC2) and high-temperature oxidation in air (Ti2AlC, Cr2AlC2, and Ti3AlC2).
Potential applications for MAX phase alloys include: as tough, machinable,
thermal shock-resistant refractories; high-temperature heating elements;
coatings for electrical contacts; and neutron irradiation resistant parts for
nuclear applications. While MAX phase alloys were discovered in the 1960s, the
first paper on the subject was not published until 1996.

***** Notes *****
   1. ^ This is a simplified explanation; other factors may include atomic
      radius, nuclear_charge, number of bond orbitals, overlap of orbital
      energies, and crystal_form.[4]
   2. ^ Trace elements having an abundance equalling or much less than one part
      per trillion (namely Tc, Pm, Po, At, Ra, Ac, Pa, Np, and Pu) are not
      shown.
   3. ^ In some cases, for example in the presence of high_energy_gamma_rays or
      in a very_high_temperature_hydrogen_rich_environment, the subject nuclei
      may experience neutron loss or proton gain resulting in the production of
      (comparatively rare) neutron_deficient_isotopes.[16]
   4. ^ The ejection of matter when two neutron stars collide is attributed to
      the interaction of their tidal_forces, possible crustal disruption, and
      shock heating (which is what happens if you floor the accelerator in car
      when the engine is cold).[19]
   5. ^ Iron, cobalt, nickel, and tin are also siderophiles from a whole of
      Earth perspective.
   6. ^ Another life-enabling role for iron is as a key constituent of
      hemoglobin, which enables the transportation of oxygen from the lungs to
      the rest of the body.
   7. ^ Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about
      12% tin and often with the addition of other metals (such as aluminium,
      manganese, nickel or zinc) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as
      arsenic, phosphorus or silicon.
   8. ^ The Chalybean peoples of Pontus in Asia Minor were being concurrently
      celebrated for working in iron and steel. Unbeknownst to them, their iron
      contained a high amount of manganese, enabling the production of a
      superior form of steel.
   9. ^ In Damascus, Syria, blade-smiths were able to forge knives and swords
      with a distinctive surface pattern composed of swirling patterns of
      light-etched regions on a nearly black background. These blades had
      legendary cutting abilities. The_iron_the_smiths_were_using was sourced
      from India, and contained one or more carbide-forming elements, such as
      V, Mo, Cr, Mn, and Nb. Modern analysis of these weapons has shown that
      these elements supported the catalytic formation of carbon nanotubes,
      which in turn promoted the formation of cementite (Fe3C) nanowires. The
      malleability of the carbon nanotubes offset the brittle nature of the
      cementite, and endowed the resulting steel with a unique combination of
      strength and flexibility. Knowledge of how to make what came to called
      Damascus_steel died out in the eighteenth century possibly due to
      exhausting ore sources with the right combination of impurities. The
      techniques involved were not rediscovered until 2009.
  10. ^ In ancient times, lead was regarded as the father of all metals.
  11. ^ Paracelsus, a later German_Renaissance writer, added the third
      principle of salt, carrying the nonvolatile and incombustible properties,
      in his tria_prima_doctrine. These theories retained the four classical
      elements as underlying the composition of sulfur, mercury and salt.
