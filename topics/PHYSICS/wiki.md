Physics (from Ancient_Greek: ÏÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® (á¼ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ®Î¼Î·), romanized:
 physiká¸ (epistá¸mÄ), lit. 'knowledge of nature', from ÏÏÏÎ¹Ï phÃ½sis
'nature')[1][2][3] is the natural_science that studies matter,[4] its motion
and behavior through space_and_time, and that studies the related entities of
energy and force.[5] Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific
disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.[a][6]
[7][8]
Physics is one of the oldest academic_disciplines and, through its inclusion of
astronomy, perhaps the oldest.[9] Over much of the past two millennia, physics,
chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics, were a part of natural
philosophy, but during the Scientific_Revolution in the 17th century these
natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.[b]
Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as
biophysics and quantum_chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly
defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied
by other sciences[6] and suggest new avenues of research in academic
disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.
Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example,
advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state_physics, and
nuclear_physics led directly to the development of new products that have
dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers,
domestic_appliances, and nuclear_weapons;[6] advances in thermodynamics led to
the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the
development of calculus.

***** History *****
Main article: History_of_physics
**** Ancient astronomy ****
Main article: History_of_astronomy
Ancient Egyptian_astronomy is evident in monuments like the ceiling_of
Senemut's_tomb from the Eighteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt.
Astronomy is one of the oldest natural_sciences. Early civilizations dating
back before 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, ancient_Egyptians, and the Indus
Valley_Civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basic understanding of
the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets were often
worshipped, believed to represent gods. While the explanations for the observed
positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these
early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were
found to traverse great_circles across the sky,[9] which however did not
explain the positions of the planets.
According to Asger_Aaboe, the origins of Western astronomy can be found in
Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exact_sciences are descended from
late Babylonian_astronomy.[11] Egyptian_astronomers left monuments showing
knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies,[12]
while Greek poet Homer wrote of various celestial objects in his Iliad and
Odyssey; later Greek_astronomers provided names, which are still used today,
for most constellations visible from the Northern_Hemisphere.[13]
**** Natural philosophy ****
Main article: Natural_philosophy
Natural_philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic_period (650 BCE
â 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic_philosophers like Thales rejected non-
naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event
had a natural cause.[14] They proposed ideas verified by reason and
observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;[15]
for example, atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it
was proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.[16]
**** Physics in the medieval European and Islamic world ****
Main article: European_science_in_the_Middle_Ages
Main article: Physics_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world
The basic way a pinhole camera works
The Western_Roman_Empire fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a
decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of Europe. By contrast,
the Eastern_Roman_Empire (also known as the Byzantine_Empire) resisted the
attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance various fields of
learning, including physics.[17]
In the sixth century Isidore of Miletus created an important compilation of
Archimedes' works that are copied in the Archimedes_Palimpsest.
In sixth century Europe John_Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar, questioned
Aristotle's teaching of physics and noted its flaws. He introduced the theory
of_impetus. Aristotle's physics was not scrutinized until Philoponus appeared;
unlike Aristotle, who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus relied
on observation. On Aristotle's physics Philoponus wrote:
     But this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by
     actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal
     argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights of
     which one is many times as heavy as the other, you will see that the
     ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the
     ratio of the weights, but that the difference in time is a very small
     one. And so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable,
     that is, of one is, let us say, double the other, there will be no
     difference, or else an imperceptible difference, in time, though the
     difference in weight is by no means negligible, with one body
     weighing twice as much as the other[18]
Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an
inspiration for Galileo_Galilei ten centuries later,[19] during the Scientific
Revolution. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially in his works when arguing
that Aristotelian physics was flawed.[20][21] In the 1300s Jean_Buridan, a
teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris, developed the
concept of impetus. It was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and
momentum.[22]
Islamic_scholarship inherited Aristotelian_physics from the Greeks and during
the Islamic_Golden_Age developed it further, especially placing emphasis on
observation and a priori reasoning, developing early forms of the scientific
method.
The most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision, which came
from the works of many scientists like Ibn_Sahl, Al-Kindi, Ibn_al-Haytham, Al-
Farisi and Avicenna. The most notable work was The_Book_of_Optics (also known
as KitÄb al-ManÄáºir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he conclusively
disproved the ancient Greek idea about vision, but also came up with a new
theory. In the book, he presented a study of the phenomenon of the camera
obscura (his thousand-year-old version of the pinhole_camera) and delved
further into the way the eye itself works. Using dissections and the knowledge
of previous scholars, he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye.
He asserted that the light ray is focused, but the actual explanation of how
light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until 1604. His Treatise on
Light explained the camera obscura, hundreds of years before the modern
development of photography.[23]
[Ibn_Al-Haytham_(Alhazen)_drawing]
Ibn_al-Haytham (c. 965âc. 1040), Book of Optics Book I, [6.85], [6.86]. Book
II, [3.80] describes his camera obscura experiments[24]
The seven-volume Book of Optics (Kitab al-Manathir) hugely influenced thinking
across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the nature of
perspective in medieval art, in both the East and the West, for more than 600
years. Many later European scholars and fellow polymaths, from Robert
Grosseteste and Leonardo_da_Vinci to RenÃ©_Descartes, Johannes_Kepler and Isaac
Newton, were in his debt. Indeed, the influence of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics
ranks alongside that of Newton's work of the same title, published 700 years
later.
The translation of The Book of Optics had a huge impact on Europe. From it,
later European scholars were able to build devices that replicated those Ibn
al-Haytham had built, and understand the way light works. From this, such
important things as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, telescopes, and cameras
were developed.
**** Classical physics ****
Main article: Classical_physics
Sir Isaac_Newton (1643â1727), whose laws_of_motion and universal_gravitation
were major milestones in classical physics
Physics became a separate science when early_modern_Europeans used experimental
and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws_of
physics.[25][page needed]
Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric
model of the Solar_System with the heliocentric Copernican_model, the laws
governing_the_motion_of_planetary_bodies determined by Johannes_Kepler between
1609 and 1619, pioneering work on telescopes and observational_astronomy by
Galileo_Galilei in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac_Newton's discovery
and unification of the laws_of_motion and universal_gravitation that would come
to bear his name.[26] Newton also developed calculus,[c] the mathematical study
of change, which provided new mathematical methods for solving physical
problems.[27]
The discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics
resulted from greater research efforts during the Industrial_Revolution as
energy needs increased.[28] The laws comprising classical physics remain very
widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic
speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and
theories such as quantum_mechanics and the theory_of_relativity simplify to
their classical equivalents at such scales. However, inaccuracies in classical
mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the
development of modern physics in the 20th century.
**** Modern physics ****
Main article: Modern_physics
See also: History_of_special_relativity and History_of_quantum_mechanics
Max_Planck (1858â1947), the originator of the theory of quantum_mechanics
Albert_Einstein (1879â1955), whose work on the photoelectric_effect and the
theory_of_relativity led to a revolution in 20th century physics
Modern_physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max_Planck in
quantum_theory and Albert_Einstein's theory_of_relativity. Both of these
theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain
situations. Classical_mechanics predicted a varying speed_of_light, which could
not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's_equations of
electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of
special_relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies
and allowed for a constant speed of light.[29] Black-body_radiation provided
another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed
that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps
proportional to their frequency; this, along with the photoelectric_effect and
a complete theory predicting discrete energy_levels of electron_orbitals, led
to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very
small scales.[30]
Quantum_mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner_Heisenberg, Erwin
SchrÃ¶dinger and Paul_Dirac.[30] From this early work, and work in related
fields, the Standard_Model_of_particle_physics was derived.[31] Following the
discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs_boson at CERN
in 2012,[32] all fundamental_particles predicted by the standard model, and no
others, appear to exist; however, physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model, with
theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research.[33] Areas of
mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of
probabilities and groups.
***** Philosophy *****
Main article: Philosophy_of_physics
In many ways, physics stems from ancient_Greek_philosophy. From Thales' first
attempt to characterise matter, to Democritus' deduction that matter ought to
reduce to an invariant state, the Ptolemaic_astronomy of a crystalline
firmament, and Aristotle's book Physics (an early book on physics, which
attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view),
various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Physics was
known as natural_philosophy until the late 18th century.[34]
By the 19th century, physics was realised as a discipline distinct from
philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies
on philosophy_of_science and its "scientific method" to advance our knowledge
of the physical world.[35] The scientific method employs a_priori_reasoning as
well as a_posteriori reasoning and the use of Bayesian_inference to measure the
validity of a given theory.[36]
The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers,
but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues
surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the
nature of space and time, determinism, and metaphysical outlooks such as
empiricism, naturalism and realism.[37]
Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their
work, for instance Laplace, who championed causal_determinism,[38] and Erwin
SchrÃ¶dinger, who wrote on quantum_mechanics.[39][40] The mathematical
physicist Roger_Penrose had been called a Platonist by Stephen_Hawking,[41] a
view Penrose discusses in his book, The_Road_to_Reality.[42] Hawking referred
to himself as an "unashamed reductionist" and took issue with Penrose's views.
[43]
***** Core theories *****
Further information: Branches_of_physics and Outline_of_physics
Though physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used
by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous
times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. For instance, the
theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects,
provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at much less than the speed
of_light. These theories continue to be areas of active research today. Chaos
theory, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics was discovered in the 20th
century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics
by Isaac_Newton (1642â1727).
These central theories are important tools for research into more specialised
topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialisation, is expected to
be literate in them. These include classical_mechanics, quantum_mechanics,
thermodynamics and statistical_mechanics, electromagnetism, and special
relativity.
**** Classical physics ****
Main article: Classical_physics
Classical physics implemented in an acoustic_engineering model of sound
reflecting from an acoustic diffuser
Classical_physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were
recognised and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th
centuryâclassical_mechanics, acoustics, optics, thermodynamics, and
electromagnetism. Classical_mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by
forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics (study of the
forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), kinematics (study
of motion without regard to its causes), and dynamics (study of motion and the
forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into solid_mechanics and
fluid_mechanics (known together as continuum_mechanics), the latter include
such branches as hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, and pneumatics.
Acoustics is the study of how sound is produced, controlled, transmitted and
received.[44] Important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics, the
study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing;
bioacoustics, the physics of animal calls and hearing,[45] and
electroacoustics, the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics.
[46]
Optics, the study of light, is concerned not only with visible_light but also
with infrared and ultraviolet_radiation, which exhibit all of the phenomena of
visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference,
diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. Heat is a form of energy,
the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is
composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other
forms of energy. Electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch
of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the
early 19th century; an electric_current gives rise to a magnetic_field, and a
changing magnetic field induces an electric current. Electrostatics deals with
electric_charges at rest, electrodynamics with moving charges, and
magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest.

Solvay_Conference of 1927, with prominent physicists such as Albert_Einstein,
Werner_Heisenberg, Max_Planck, Hendrik_Lorentz, Niels_Bohr, Marie_Curie, Erwin
SchrÃ¶dinger and Paul_Dirac
Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal
scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the
behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or
very small scale. For example, atomic and nuclear_physics studies matter on the
smallest scale at which chemical_elements can be identified. The physics_of
elementary_particles is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the
most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy
physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types
of particles in particle_accelerators. On this scale, ordinary, commonsensical
notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.[47]
The two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the
concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics.
Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while quantum_theory is
concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and
subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in
the description of such phenomena. The theory_of_relativity is concerned with
the description of phenomena that take place in a frame_of_reference that is in
motion with respect to an observer; the special_theory_of_relativity is
concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the general
theory_of_relativity with motion and its connection with gravitation. Both
quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of
modern physics.[48]
**** Difference between classical and modern physics ****
The basic domains of physics
While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit
domains of applicability. Loosely speaking, the laws of classical_physics
accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the
atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside
of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical
mechanics. Albert_Einstein contributed the framework of special_relativity,
which replaced notions of absolute_time_and_space with spacetime and allowed an
accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the
speed of light. Max_Planck, Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger, and others introduced quantum
mechanics, a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an
accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, quantum_field
theory unified quantum_mechanics and special_relativity. General_relativity
allowed for a dynamical, curved spacetime, with which highly massive systems
and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. General
relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions;
several candidate theories of quantum_gravity are being developed.
***** Relation to other fields *****
This parabola-shaped lava_flow illustrates the application of mathematics in
physicsâin this case, Galileo's law_of_falling_bodies.
Mathematics and ontology are used in physics. Physics is used in chemistry and
cosmology.
**** Prerequisites ****
Mathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in
nature. This was noted and advocated by Pythagoras,[49] Plato,[50] Galileo,[51]
and Newton.
Physics uses mathematics[52] to organise and formulate experimental results.
From those results, precise or estimated solutions are obtained, quantitative
results from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or
negated. The results from physics experiments are numerical data, with their
units_of_measure and estimates of the errors in the measurements. Technologies
based on mathematics, like computation have made computational_physics an
active area of research.
The distinction between mathematics and physics is clear-cut, but not always
obvious, especially in mathematical physics.
Ontology is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means
physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while
mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world.
Thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are
analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories.
Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of
physics statements must match observed and experimental data.
The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical
physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are
mathematical, but its subject is physical.[53] The problems in this field start
with a "mathematical_model_of_a_physical_situation" (system) and a
"mathematical description of a physical law" that will be applied to that
system. Every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find
physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find
meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.[clarification_needed]
Pure physics is a branch of fundamental_science (also called basic science) .
Physics is also called "the fundamental science" because all branches of
natural_science like chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained
by laws of physics.[54] Similarly, chemistry is often called the_central
science because of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example,
chemistry studies properties, structures, and reactions of matter (chemistry's
focus on the molecular and atomic scale distinguishes_it_from_physics).
Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other,
properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions
are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass, and charge.
Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.
**** Application and influence ****
Main article: Applied_physics
Archimedes'_screw, a simple_machine for lifting
The application of physical laws in lifting liquids
Applied_physics is a general term for physics research which is intended for a
particular use. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in
an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually
differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing
something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics
research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.
The approach is similar to that of applied_mathematics. Applied physicists use
physics in scientific research. For instance, people working on accelerator
physics might seek to build better particle_detectors for research in
theoretical physics.
Physics is used heavily in engineering. For example, statics, a subfield of
mechanics, is used in the building of bridges and other static structures. The
understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert
halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices. An
understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight_simulators, video
games, and movies, and is often critical in forensic investigations.
With the standard_consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not
change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be
mired in uncertainty. For example, in the study_of_the_origin_of_the_earth, one
can reasonably model earth's mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a
function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so
predict future or prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering
that drastically speed up the development of a new technology.
But there is also considerable interdisciplinarity, so many other important
fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of econophysics and
sociophysics).
***** Research *****
**** Scientific method ****
Physicists use the_scientific_method to test the validity of a physical_theory.
By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the
conclusions drawn from its related experiments and observations, physicists are
better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and
repeatable way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are
made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of the theory.[55]
A scientific_law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation
that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton's law of
universal gravitation.[56]
**** Theory and experiment ****

and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed
separately, they strongly affect and depend upon each other. Progress in
physics frequently comes about when experimental results def explanation by
existing theories, prompting intense focus on applicable modelling, and when
new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire
developing new experiments (and often related equipment, possibly roping in
some applied physicists to help build it).[57]
Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called
phenomenologists, who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work
to relate them to a fundamental_theory.[58]
Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy;
electromagnetism was unified this way.[d] Beyond the known universe, the field
of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,[e] such as parallel
universes, a multiverse, and higher_dimensions. Theorists invoke these ideas in
hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories. They then explore
the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.
Experimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineering and technology.
Experimental physicists involved in basic_research design and perform
experiments with equipment such as particle_accelerators and lasers, whereas
those involved in applied_research often work in industry developing
technologies such as magnetic_resonance_imaging (MRI) and transistors. Feynman
has noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well
by theorists.[59]
**** Scope and aims ****
Physics involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative.
Here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of calculus to
explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as mechanics.
Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from elementary_particles (such as
quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest superclusters of galaxies.
Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other
things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the "fundamental_science".[54]
Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of
simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to
humans to root_causes, and then connect these causes together.
For example, the ancient_Chinese observed that certain rocks (lodestone and
magnetite) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. This effect was
later called magnetism, which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century.
But even before the Chinese discovered magnetism, the ancient_Greeks knew of
other objects such as amber, that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar
invisible attraction between the two.[60] This was also first studied
rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity. Thus, physics
had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause
(electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed
that these two forces were just two different aspects of one
forceâelectromagnetism. This process of "unifying" forces continues today,
and electromagnetism and the weak_nuclear_force are now considered to be two
aspects of the electroweak_interaction. Physics hopes to find an ultimate
reason (theory_of_everything) for why nature is as it is (see section Current
research below for more information).[61]
**** Research fields ****
Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and
particle_physics; condensed_matter_physics; atomic,_molecular,_and_optical
physics; astrophysics; and applied_physics. Some physics departments also
support physics_education_research and physics_outreach.[62]
Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become
increasingly specialised, and today most physicists work in a single field for
their entire careers. "Universalists" such as Albert_Einstein (1879â1955) and
Lev_Landau (1908â1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now
very rare.[f]
The major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and
concepts they employ, are shown in the following table.

*** Nuclear and particle physics ***
Main articles: Particle_physics and Nuclear_physics
A simulated event in the CMS detector of the Large_Hadron_Collider, featuring a
possible appearance of the Higgs_boson.
Particle_physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and
energy and the interactions between them.[63] In addition, particle physicists
design and develop the high-energy accelerators,[64] detectors,[65] and
computer_programs[66] necessary for this research. The field is also called
"high-energy physics" because many elementary particles do not occur naturally
but are created only during high-energy collisions of other particles.[67]
Currently, the interactions of elementary particles and fields are described by
the Standard_Model.[68] The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter
(quarks and leptons) that interact via the strong, weak, and electromagnetic
fundamental_forces.[68] Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles
exchanging gauge_bosons (gluons, W_and_Z_bosons, and photons, respectively).
[69] The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the Higgs_boson.[68]
In July 2012 CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, announced the
detection of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson,[70] an integral part
of a Higgs_mechanism.
Nuclear_physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents and
interactions of atomic_nuclei. The most commonly known applications of nuclear
physics are nuclear_power generation and nuclear_weapons technology, but the
research has provided application in many fields, including those in nuclear
medicine and magnetic_resonance_imaging, ion_implantation in materials
engineering, and radiocarbon_dating in geology and archaeology.
*** Atomic, molecular, and optical physics ***
Main article: Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics
Atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO) is the study of matterâmatter
and lightâmatter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules. The
three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the
similarity of methods used, and the commonality of their relevant energy
scales. All three areas include both classical, semi-classical and quantum
treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast
to a macroscopic view).
Atomic_physics studies the electron_shells of atoms. Current research focuses
on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions,[71]
[72][73] low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron
correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by the
nucleus (see hyperfine_splitting), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as fission
and fusion are considered part of nuclear_physics.
Molecular_physics focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and
external interactions with matter and light. Optical_physics is distinct from
optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields
by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of optical_fields and
their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.
*** Condensed matter physics ***
Main article: Condensed_matter_physics
Velocity-distribution data of a gas of rubidium atoms, confirming the discovery
of a new phase of matter, the BoseâEinstein_condensate
Condensed_matter_physics is the field of physics that deals with the
macroscopic physical properties of matter.[74] In particular, it is concerned
with the "condensed" phases that appear whenever the number of particles in a
system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong.[75]
The most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which
arise from the bonding by way of the electromagnetic_force between atoms.[76]
More exotic condensed phases include the superfluid[77] and the BoseâEinstein
condensate[78] found in certain atomic systems at very low temperature, the
superconducting phase exhibited by conduction_electrons in certain materials,
[79] and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic
lattices.[80]
Condensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics.
Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of solid-state_physics, which
is now considered one of its main subfields.[81] The term condensed matter
physics was apparently coined by Philip_Anderson when he renamed his research
groupâpreviously solid-state theoryâin 1967.[82] In 1978, the Division of
Solid State Physics of the American_Physical_Society was renamed as the
Division of Condensed Matter Physics.[81] Condensed matter physics has a large
overlap with chemistry, materials_science, nanotechnology and engineering.[75]
*** Astrophysics ***
Main articles: Astrophysics and Physical_cosmology
The deepest visible-light image of the universe, the Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field
Astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of
physics to the study of stellar_structure, stellar_evolution, the origin of the
Solar System, and related problems of cosmology. Because astrophysics is a
broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics,
including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics,
quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and
molecular physics.[83]
The discovery by Karl_Jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by
celestial bodies initiated the science of radio_astronomy. Most recently, the
frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations
and interference from the earth's atmosphere make space-based observations
necessary for infrared, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and X-ray_astronomy.
Physical_cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe
on its largest scales. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central
role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, Hubble's
discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the Hubble_diagram,
prompted rival explanations known as the steady_state universe and the Big
Bang.
The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis and the
discovery of the cosmic_microwave_background in 1964. The Big Bang model rests
on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the
cosmological_principle. Cosmologists have recently established the ÎCDM_model
of the evolution of the universe, which includes cosmic_inflation, dark_energy,
and dark_matter.
Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data
from the Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly
revise or clarify existing models of the universe.[84][85] In particular, the
potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over
the next several years.[86] Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is
composed of weakly_interacting_massive_particles, complementing similar
experiments with the Large_Hadron_Collider and other underground detectors.
IBEX is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries: "No one knows what is
creating the ENA_(energetic_neutral_atoms) ribbon" along the termination_shock
of the solar_wind, "but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of
the heliosphereâin which the Solar System's enveloping pocket filled with the
solar wind's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing 'galactic wind'
of the interstellar medium in the shape of a cometâis wrong."[87]

A typical phenomenon described by physics: a magnet levitating above a
superconductor demonstrates the Meissner_effect.
Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.
In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that
of high-temperature_superconductivity.[88] Many condensed matter experiments
are aiming to fabricate workable spintronics and quantum_computers.[75][89]
In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics
beyond the Standard_Model have begun to appear. Foremost among these are
indications that neutrinos have non-zero mass. These experimental results
appear to have solved the long-standing solar_neutrino_problem, and the physics
of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental
research. The Large_Hadron_Collider has already found the Higgs_boson, but
future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry, which extends the
Standard Model of particle physics. Research on the nature of the major
mysteries of dark_matter and dark_energy is also currently ongoing.[90]
Theoretical attempts to unify quantum_mechanics and general_relativity into a
single theory of quantum_gravity, a program ongoing for over half a century,
have not yet been decisively resolved. The current leading candidates are M-
theory, superstring_theory and loop_quantum_gravity.
Many astronomical and cosmological phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily
explained, including the origin of ultra-high-energy_cosmic_rays, the baryon
asymmetry, the acceleration_of_the_universe and the anomalous_rotation_rates_of
galaxies.
Although much progress has been made in high-energy, quantum, and astronomical
physics, many everyday phenomena involving complexity,[91] chaos,[92] or
turbulence[93] are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like
they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain
unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling
water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of surface_tension catastrophes,
and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.[94]
These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for
several reasons, including the availability of modern mathematical methods and
computers, which enabled complex_systems to be modeled in new ways. Complex
physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research, as
exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of
pattern_formation in biological systems. In the 1932 Annual Review of Fluid
Mechanics, Horace_Lamb said:[95]
     I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two
     matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum
     electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And
     about the former I am rather optimistic.

***** Notes *****
   1. ^ The term "universe" is defined as everything that physically exists:
      the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum,
      and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term
      "universe" may also be used in slightly different contextual senses,
      denoting concepts such as the cosmos or the philosophical_world.
   2. ^ Francis_Bacon's 1620 Novum_Organum was critical in the development_of
      scientific_method.[10]
   3. ^ Calculus was independently developed at around the same time by
      Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz; while Leibniz was the first to publish his
      work and develop much of the notation used for calculus today, Newton was
      the first to develop calculus and apply it to physical problems. See also
      LeibnizâNewton_calculus_controversy
   4. ^ See, for example, the influence of Kant and Ritter on Ãrsted.
   5. ^ Concepts which are denoted hypothetical can change with time. For
      example, the atom of nineteenth-century physics was denigrated by some,
      including Ernst_Mach's critique of Ludwig_Boltzmann's formulation of
      statistical_mechanics. By the end of World War II, the atom was no longer
      deemed hypothetical.
   6. ^ Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example,
      the World_Wide_Web, which was innovated at CERN by Tim_Berners-Lee, was
      created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is
      intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for
      arXiv.org

  51. ^ "Although usually remembered today as a philosopher, Plato was also one
      of ancient Greece's most important patrons of mathematics. Inspired by
      Pythagoras, he founded his Academy in Athens in 387 BC, where he stressed
      mathematics as a way of understanding more about reality. In particular,
      he was convinced that geometry was the key to unlocking the secrets of
      the universe. The sign above the Academy entrance read: 'Let no-one
      ignorant of geometry enter here.'" (Mastin_2010)
  52. ^ "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our
      eyes. I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first
      learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This
      book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are
      triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without whose help it
      is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it, and without
      which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." â Galileo (1623),
