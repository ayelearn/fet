Screenshot of a structure map generated by Contour map software for an 8500ft
deep gas & Oil_reservoir in the Earth field, Vermilion_Parish, Erath,
Louisiana. The left-to-right gap, near the top of the contour_map indicates a
fault. This fault line is between the blue/green contour lines and the purple/
red/yellow contour lines. The thin red circular contour line in the middle of
the map indicates the top of the oil reservoir. Because gas floats above oil,
the thin red contour line marks the gas/oil contact zone. Reservoir engineers
could use the map as a part of their well drill planning.
Reservoir engineering is a branch of petroleum_engineering that applies
scientific principles to the fluid flow through porous medium during the
development and production of oil and gas reservoirs so as to obtain a high
economic recovery. The working tools of the reservoir engineer are subsurface
geology, applied mathematics, and the basic laws of physics and chemistry
governing the behavior of liquid and vapor phases of crude oil, natural gas,
and water in reservoir rock. Of particular interest to reservoir engineers is
generating accurate reserves estimates for use in financial reporting to the
SEC and other regulatory bodies. Other job responsibilities include numerical
reservoir modeling, production forecasting, well testing, well drilling and
workover planning, economic modeling, and PVT analysis of reservoir fluids.
Reservoir engineers also play a central role in field development planning,
recommending appropriate and cost effective reservoir depletion schemes such as
waterflooding or gas injection to maximize hydrocarbon recovery. Due to
legislative changes in many hydrocarbon producing countries, they are also
involved in the design and implementation of carbon_sequestration projects in
order to minimise the emission of greenhouse gases.

Reservoir engineers often specialize in two areas:
    * Surveillance engineering, i.e. monitoring of existing fields and
      optimization of production and injection rates. Surveillance engineers
      typically use analytical and empirical techniques to perform their work,
      including decline curve analysis, material balance modeling, and inflow/
      outflow analysis.
    * Dynamic modeling, i.e. the conduct of reservoir_simulation studies to
      determine optimal development plans for oil and gas reservoirs. Also,
      reservoir engineers perform and integrate well tests into their data for
      reservoirs in geothermal drilling.
