Bread is a staple_food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by
baking. Throughout recorded history it has been a prominent food in large parts
of the world and is one of the oldest man-made foods, having been of
significant importance since the dawn of agriculture.
Bread may be leavened by processes such as reliance on naturally occurring
sourdough microbes, chemicals, industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure
aeration. Commercial bread commonly contains additives to improve flavor,
texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of manufacturing.
Bread plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture.

***** Etymology *****
The Old_English word for bread was hlaf (hlaifs in Gothic: modern English
loaf), which appears to be the oldest Teutonic name.[1] Old_High_German hleib
[2] and modern German Laib derive from this Proto-Germanic word, which was
borrowed into Slavic (Polish chleb, Russian khleb) and Finnic (Finnish leipÃ¤,
Estonian leib) languages as well. The Middle and Modern_English word bread
appears in Germanic_languages, such as West_Frisian brea, Dutch brood, German
Brot, Swedish brÃ¶d, and Norwegian and Danish brÃ¸d; it may be related to brew
or perhaps to break, originally meaning "broken piece", "morsel".[3]
***** History *****
Main article: History_of_bread
Bread shop, Tacuinum_Sanitatis from Northern Italy, beginning of the 15th
century
Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in
Europe revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants.[4] It is
possible that during this time, starch extract from the roots of plants, such
as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock, placed over a fire and cooked
into a primitive form of flatbread. The world's oldest evidence of bread-making
has been found in a 14,500 year old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern
desert.[5][6] Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the
spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast spores
are ubiquitous, including on the surface of cereal_grains, so any dough left to
rest leavens naturally.[7]
There were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread. Airborne
yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some
time before cooking. Pliny_the_Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used
the foam skimmed from beer called barm to produce "a lighter kind of bread than
other peoples" such as barm_cake. Parts of the ancient world that drank wine
instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed
to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The
most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the
previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter, as Pliny also reported.[8]
[9]
The Chorleywood_bread_process was developed in 1961; it uses the intense
mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and
the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows
for the use of lower protein grain, is now widely used around the world in
large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low
costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However, there has been some
criticism of the effect on nutritional value.[10][11][12]
***** Types *****
Main article: List_of_breads
Brown bread (left) and whole grain bread
Dark sprouted_bread
Bread is the staple_food of the Middle_East, Central_Asia, North_Africa,
Europe, and in European-derived cultures such as those in the Americas,
Australia, and Southern_Africa, in contrast to parts of South and East Asia
where rice or noodle is the staple. Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour
dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an
oven. The addition of yeast to the bread explains the air pockets commonly
found in bread.[13] Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough
sponginess and elasticity), common_or_bread_wheat is the most common grain used
for the preparation of bread, which makes the largest single contribution to
the world's food supply of any food.[14]
Strucia â a type of European sweet bread
Bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including spelt,
emmer, einkorn and kamut).[15] Non-wheat cereals including rye, barley, maize
(corn), oats, sorghum, millet and rice have been used to make bread, but, with
the exception of rye, usually in combination with wheat flour as they have less
gluten.[16]
Gluten-free_breads have been created[17] for people affected by gluten-related
disorders such as coeliac_disease and non-coeliac_gluten_sensitivity, who may
benefit from a gluten-free_diet. Gluten-free bread is made with ground flours
from a variety of materials such as almonds, rice, sorghum, corn, or legumes
such as beans, and tubers such as cassava, but since these flours lack gluten
they may not hold their shape as they rise and their crumb may be dense with
little aeration. Additives such as xanthan gum, guar gum, hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose (HPMC), corn starch, or eggs are used to compensate for the
lack of gluten.[18][19][20]
***** Properties *****
**** Physical-chemical composition ****
In wheat, phenolic compounds are mainly found in hulls in the form of insoluble
bound ferulic_acid, where it is relevant to wheat resistance to fungal
diseases.[21]
Rye_bread contains phenolic_acids and ferulic_acid_dehydrodimers.[22]
Three natural_phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol_diglucoside, p-coumaric
acid_glucoside and ferulic_acid_glucoside, can be found in commercial breads
containing flaxseed.[23]
Glutenin and gliadin are functional proteins found in wheat bread that
contribute to the structure of bread. Glutenin forms interconnected gluten
networks within bread through interchain disulfide bonds.[24] Gliadin binds
weakly to the gluten network established by glutenin via intrachain disulfide
bonds.[24] Structurally, bread can be defined as an elastic-plastic foam (same
as styrofoam). The glutenin protein contributes to its elastic nature, as it is
able to regain its initial shape after deformation. The gliadin protein
contributes to its plastic nature, because it demonstrates non-reversible
structural change after a certain amount of applied force. Because air pockets
within this gluten network result from carbon dioxide production during
leavening, bread can be defined as a foam, or a gas-in-solid solution.[25]
Acrylamide, like in other starchy foods that have been heated higher than
120 Â°C (248 Â°F), has been found in recent years to occur in bread. Acrylamide
is neurotoxic, has adverse effects on male reproduction and developmental
toxicity and is carcinogenic. A study has found that more than ninety nine
percent of the acrylamide in bread is found in the crust.[26]
**** Culinary uses ****
Bread_pudding
Bread can be served at many temperatures; once baked, it can subsequently be
toasted. It is most commonly eaten with the hands, either by itself or as a
carrier for other foods. Bread can be dipped into liquids such as gravy, olive
oil, or soup;[27] it can be topped with various sweet and savory spreads, or
used to make sandwiches containing meats, cheeses, vegetables, and condiments.
[28]
Bread is used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as the use
of breadcrumbs to provide crunchy crusts or thicken sauces, sweet or savoury
bread_puddings, or as a binding agent in sausages and other ground meat
products.[29]
**** Nutritional significance ****
Nutritionally, bread is categorized as a source of grains in the food_pyramid
and is a good source of carbohydrates and nutrients such as magnesium, iron,
selenium, B vitamins, and dietary fiber.[30]
**** Crust ****
Crust of a cut bread made of whole-grain rye with crust crack (half right at
the top)
Bread crust is formed from surface dough during the cooking process. It is
hardened and browned through the Maillard_reaction using the sugars and amino
acids and the intense heat at the bread surface. The crust of most breads is
harder, and more complexly and intensely flavored, than the rest. Old_wives
tales suggest that eating the bread crust makes a person's hair curlier.[31]
Additionally, the crust is rumored to be healthier than the remainder of the
bread. Some studies have shown that this is true as the crust has more dietary
fiber and antioxidants such as pronyl-lysine,[32][33] which is being researched
for its potential colorectal_cancer inhibitory properties.[34][35]
***** Preparation *****
Steps in bread making, here for an unleavened Chilean tortilla
Doughs are usually baked, but in some cuisines breads are steamed (e.g.,
mantou), fried (e.g., puri), or baked on an unoiled frying_pan (e.g.,
tortillas). It may be leavened or unleavened (e.g. matzo). Salt, fat and
leavening_agents such as yeast and baking_soda are common ingredients, though
bread may contain other ingredients, such as milk, egg, sugar, spice, fruit
(such as raisins), vegetables (such as onion), nuts (such as walnut) or seeds
(such as poppy).[36]
Methods of processing dough into bread include the straight_dough_process, the
sourdough_process, the Chorleywood_bread_process and the sponge_and_dough
process.
Baking bread in East_Timor
**** Formulation ****
Professional bread recipes are stated using the baker's_percentage notation.
The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, and the other ingredients are
expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is
more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry
ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement
in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours
absorb about 62% water, while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%.[37] Common
table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread.
Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water. In yeast
breads, the higher water percentages result in more CO2 bubbles and a coarser
bread crumb. One pound (450 g) of flour yields a standard loaf of bread or two
French loaves.
Calcium_propionate is commonly added by commercial bakeries to retard the
growth of molds.[38]
**** Flour ****
Main article: Flour
Flour is grain ground to a powdery consistency. Flour provides the primary
structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The protein content of
the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread dough and the
finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a
specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12â14%), is recommended for
high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9â11%)
to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength
properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which
gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred
by most artisan bakers.[39]
Wheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein
groups (albumin, globulin, and proteoses) and two water-insoluble protein
groups (glutenin and gliadin). When flour is mixed with water, the water-
soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the
structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by
kneading, or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see no-knead_bread),
the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the
shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting
networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as gluten. Gluten
development improves if the dough is allowed to autolyse.[40]
**** Liquids ****
Water, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough.
The weight of liquid required varies between recipes, but a ratio of 3 parts
liquid to 5 parts flour is common for yeast breads.[41] Recipes that use steam
as the primary leavening method may have a liquid content in excess of 1 part
liquid to 1 part flour. Instead of water, recipes may use liquids such as milk
or other dairy_products (including buttermilk or yoghurt), fruit juice, or
eggs. These contribute additional sweeteners, fats, or leavening components, as
well as water.[42]
**** Fats or shortenings ****
Fats, such as butter, vegetable oils, lard, or that contained in eggs, affect
the development of gluten in breads by coating and lubricating the individual
strands of protein. They also help to hold the structure together. If too much
fat is included in a bread dough, the lubrication effect causes the protein
structures to divide. A fat content of approximately 3% by weight is the
concentration that produces the greatest leavening action.[43] In addition to
their effects on leavening, fats also serve to tenderize breads and preserve
freshness.
**** Bread improvers ****
Main article: Bread_improver
Bread_improvers and dough_conditioners are often used in producing commercial
breads to reduce the time needed for rising and to improve texture and volume.
The substances used may be oxidising agents to strengthen the dough or reducing
agents to develop gluten and reduce mixing time, emulsifiers to strengthen the
dough or to provide other properties such as making slicing easier, or enzymes
to increase gas production.[44]
Salt is often added to enhance flavor and restrict yeast activity. It also
affects the crumb and the overall texture by stabilizing and strengthening[45]
the gluten. Some artisan bakers forego early addition of salt to the dough,
whether wholemeal or refined, and wait until after a 20-minute rest to allow
the dough to autolyse.[46]
***** Leavening *****

Leavening is the process of adding gas to a dough before or during baking to
produce a lighter, more easily chewed bread. Most bread eaten in the West is
leavened.[47]
**** Chemicals ****
A simple technique for leavening bread is the use of gas-producing chemicals.
There are two common methods. The first is to use baking_powder or a self-
raising_flour that includes baking powder. The second is to include an acidic
ingredient such as buttermilk and add baking_soda; the reaction of the acid
with the soda produces gas.[47] Chemically leavened breads are called quick
breads and soda_breads. This method is commonly used to make muffins, pancakes,
American-style biscuits, and quick breads such as banana_bread.
**** Yeast ****
Main article: Baker's_yeast
Compressed fresh yeast
Many breads are leavened by yeast. The yeast most commonly used for leavening
bread is Saccharomyces_cerevisiae, the same species used for brewing alcoholic
beverages. This yeast ferments some of the carbohydrates in the flour,
including any sugar, producing carbon_dioxide. Commercial bakers often leaven
their dough with commercially produced baker's_yeast. Baker's yeast has the
advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is
obtained from a pure_culture.[47] Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast
with a growth culture. If kept in the right conditions, it provides leavening
for many years.[48]
The baker's yeast and sourdough methods follow the same pattern. Water is mixed
with flour, salt and the leavening agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats,
seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed
dough is then allowed to rise one or more times (a longer rising time results
in more flavor, so bakers often "punch down" the dough and let it rise again),
then loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is
baked in an oven.[47]
Many breads are made from a "straight_dough", which means that all of the
ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising
time;[47] others are made from a "pre-ferment" in which the leavening agent is
combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and
allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients
are added, and the process continues as with straight dough. This produces a
more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as
a compromise between the reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and
complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a
minimal amount of baker's yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first
became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories:
"poolish" or "pouliche", a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal
amounts of flour and water (by weight); "biga", a stiff mixture with a higher
proportion of flour; and "pÃ¢te fermentÃ©e", which is simply a portion of dough
reserved from a previous batch.[49][50]

Sourdough loaves
**** Sourdough ****
Main article: Sourdough
Sourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using
naturally occurring yeasts and lactobacilli. It usually has a mildly sour taste
because of the lactic_acid produced during anaerobic fermentation by the
lactobacilli.[51][52]
Sourdough breads are made with a sourdough starter. The starter cultivates
yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the
microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A
starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water.
Some bakers have starters many generations old, which are said to have a
special taste or texture.[51] At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were
sourdoughs. Recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan
bakeries.[53]
Traditionally, peasant families throughout Europe baked on a fixed schedule,
perhaps once a week. The starter was saved from the previous week's dough. The
starter was mixed with the new ingredients, the dough was left to rise, and
then a piece of it was saved (to be the starter for next week's bread).[47]
**** Steam ****
The rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which is
as simple as it is unpredictable. Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the
steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens
regardless of the raising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour
dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either
contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water
from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and
makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it
has been put in the oven.[54] CO2 generation, on its own, is too small to
account for the rise. Heat kills bacteria or yeast at an early stage, so the
CO2 generation is stopped.
**** Bacteria ****
Salt-rising_bread employs a form of bacterial leavening that does not require
yeast. Although the leavening action is inconsistent, and requires close
attention to the incubating conditions, this bread is making a comeback for its
cheese-like flavor and fine texture.[55]
**** Aeration ****
Aerated_bread was leavened by carbon dioxide being forced into dough under
pressure. From the mid 19th to mid 20th centuries bread made this way was
somewhat popular in the United Kingdom, made by the Aerated_Bread_Company and
sold in its high-street tearooms. The company was founded in 1862, and ceased
independent operations in 1955.[56]
The Pressure-Vacuum mixer was later developed by the Flour Milling and Baking
Research Association for the Chorleywood_bread_process. It manipulates the gas
bubble size and optionally the composition of gases in the dough via the gas
applied to the headspace.[57] The organic baker Andrew Whitely, writing in The
Independent, called the process "the covert corruption of our daily food".[58]
***** Cultural significance *****

Main article: Bread_in_culture
Bread_has_a_significance_beyond_mere_nutrition_in_many_cultures because of its
history and contemporary importance. Bread is also significant_in_Christianity
as one of the elements (alongside wine) of the Eucharist,[59] and in other
religions including Paganism.[60]
In many cultures, bread is a metaphor for basic necessities and living
conditions in general. For example, a "bread-winner" is a household's main
economic contributor and has little to do with actual bread-provision. This is
also seen in the phrase "putting bread on the table". The Roman poet Juvenal
satirized superficial politicians and the public as caring only for "panem et
circenses" (bread_and_circuses).[61] In Russia in 1917, the Bolsheviks promised
"peace, land, and bread."[62][63] The term "breadbasket" denotes an
agriculturally productive region. In Slavic cultures bread_and_salt is offered
as a welcome to guests.[64] In India, life's basic necessities are often
referred to as "roti, kapra aur makan" (bread, cloth, and house).[65]
Words for bread, including "dough" and "bread" itself, are used in English-
speaking countries as synonyms for money.[1] A remarkable or revolutionary
innovation may be called the best thing since "sliced_bread".[66] The
expression "to break bread with someone" means "to share a meal with someone".
[67] The English word "lord" comes from the Anglo-Saxon hlÄfweard, meaning
"bread keeper."[68]
Bread is sometimes referred to as "the staff of life", although this term can
refer to other staple foods in different cultures: the Oxford_English
Dictionary defines it as "bread (or similar staple food)".[69][70] This is
sometimes thought to be a biblical reference, but the nearest wording is in
Leviticus 26 "when I have broken the staff of your bread".[71] The term has
been adopted in the names of bakery firms.[72]

      emmer, einkorn and kamut. These wheat varieties are commonly referred to
      as âancientâ grains and are increasingly being used in the
      manufacture of niche wheat-based food products.
