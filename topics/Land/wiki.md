Land, sometimes referred to as dry land, is the solid surface of Earth that is
not permanently covered by water.[1] The vast majority of human activity
throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture,
habitat, and various natural_resources. Some life forms (including terrestrial
plants and terrestrial_animals) have developed from predecessor species that
lived in bodies_of_water.
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal_zones. The
division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The
demarcation between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other
factors. A maritime_boundary is one example of a political demarcation. A
variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets
land. Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy
boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of
water has begun. Demarcation can further vary due to tides and weather.

The word 'land' is derived from Middle English land, lond and Old_English land,
lond (âearth, land, soil, ground; defined piece of land, territory, realm,
province, district; landed property; country (not town); ridge in a ploughed
fieldâ), from Proto-Germanic *landÄ (âlandâ), and from Proto-Indo-
European *lendÊ°- (âland, heathâ). Cognate with Scots land (âlandâ),
West Frisian lÃ¢n (âlandâ), Dutch land (âlandâ), German Land (âland,
country, stateâ), Swedish land (âland, country, shore, territoryâ),
Icelandic land (âlandâ). Non-Germanic cognates include Old Irish lann
(âheathâ), Welsh llan (âenclosureâ), Breton lann (âheathâ), Old
Church Slavonic lÄdÐ¾ from Proto-Slavic *lenda (âheath, wastelandâ) and
Albanian lÃ«ndinÃ« (âheath, grasslandâ) from lÃ«ndÃ« (âmatter,
substanceâ).
A continuous area of land surrounded by ocean is called a "landmass". Although
it may be most often written as one word to distinguish it from the usage "land
mass"âthe measure of land areaâit is also used as two words. Landmasses
include supercontinents, continents, and islands. There are four major
continuous landmasses on Earth: Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, Antarctica and
Australia. Land, capable of being ploughed and used to grow crops, is called
arable_land.[2] A country or region may be referred to as the motherland,
fatherland, or homeland of its people. Many countries and other places have
names incorporating -land (e.g. New_Zealand).
***** History of land on Earth[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_Earth
Artist's conception of Hadean_Eon Earth.

Pangaea until the present day.
The earliest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5672Â±0.0006 bya
(billion years ago);[3] therefore, the Earth itself must have been formed by
accretion around this time. By 4.54Â±0.04 bya,[4] the primordial Earth had
formed. The formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System bodies occurred in
tandem with the Sun. In theory, a solar_nebula partitions a volume out of a
molecular_cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten
into a circumstellar_disc, which the planets then grow out of in tandem with
the star. A nebula contains gas, ice grains and dust (including primordial
nuclides). In nebular_theory, planetesimals commence forming as particulate
matter accrues by cohesive_clumping and then by gravity. The assembly of the
primordial Earth proceeded for 10â20 myr.[5]
Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing
that included water_vapor. The origin_of_the_world's_oceans was condensation
augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids, proto-planets, and comets.
[6] In this_model, atmospheric "greenhouse_gases" kept the oceans from freezing
while the newly forming Sun was only at 70% luminosity.[7] By 3.5 bya, the
Earth's_magnetic_field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere
from being stripped away by the solar_wind.[8] The atmosphere and oceans of the
Earth continuously shape the land by eroding and transporting solids on the
surface.[9]
The crust, which currently forms the Earth's land, was created when the molten
outer layer of the planet Earth cooled to_form a solid mass as the accumulated
water vapor began to act in the atmosphere. Once land became capable of
supporting life, biodiversity evolved over hundreds of million years, expanding
continually except when punctuated by mass extinctions.[10]
The two models[11] that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the
present-day forms[12] or, more likely, a rapid growth[13] early in Earth
history[14] followed by a long-term steady continental area.[15][16][17]
Continents formed by plate_tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the
continuous loss of heat from the Earth's interior. On time_scales lasting
hundreds of millions of years, the supercontinents have formed and broken apart
three times. Roughly 750 mya (million years ago), one of the earliest known
supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined
to form Pannotia, 600â540 mya, then finally Pangaea, which also broke apart
180 mya.[18]
***** Area[edit] *****
Main article: Land_area
For a contiguous region of land surrounded by ocean, see Landmass.
"Land area" (also known as "land mass") refers to the total surface_area of the
land of a geographical region or country (which may include discontinuous
sections of land such as islands). Earth's total planimetric (flat) land area
is approximately 148,939,063.133 km2 (57,505,693.767 sq mi) which is about
29.2% of its total surface. However, when terrain and topsoil relief are
factored in, the actual topographic surface area â that exposed to the Sun,
air and rain â is approximately quadrupled.[19] Water covers approximately
70.8% of planimetric Earth's surface, mainly in the form of oceans and ice
formations; but this proportion is decreased by the land's increased terrain.

***** Cultural perspectives[edit] *****
Main article: Earth_in_culture
Creation_myths in many religions recall a story involving the creation of the
world by a supernatural deity or deities, including accounts wherein the land
is separated from the oceans and the air. The Earth itself has often been
personified as a deity, in particular a goddess. In many cultures, the mother
goddess is also portrayed as a fertility_deity. To the Aztecs, Earth was called
Tonantzinâ"our mother"; to the Incas, Earth was called Pachamamaâ"mother
earth". The Chinese Earth goddess Hou_Tu[24] is similar to Gaia, the Greek
goddess personifying the Earth. Bhuma_Devi is the goddess of Earth in Hinduism,
influenced by Graha. In Norse_mythology, the Earth giantess JÃ¶rÃ° was the
mother of Thor and the daughter of Annar. Ancient_Egyptian_mythology is
different from that of other cultures because Earth (Geb) is male and sky (Nut)
is female.
In the past, there were varying levels of belief in a flat_Earth. The Jewish
conception of a flat earth is found in both biblical and post-biblical times.
[note_1][neutrality is disputed][note_2][neutrality is disputed]
Imago_Mundi Babylonian map, the oldest known world map, 6th century BC
Babylonia.
In early Egyptian[25] and Mesopotamian_thought, the world was portrayed as a
flat disk floating in the ocean. The Egyptian universe was pictured as a
rectangular box with a north-south orientation and with a slightly concave
surface, with Egypt in the center. A similar model is found in the Homeric
account of the 8th century BC in which "Okeanos, the personified body of water
surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and
possibly of all gods."[26] The biblical_earth is a flat disc floating on water.
[27]
The Pyramid_Texts and Coffin_Texts reveal that the ancient Egyptians believed
Nun (the ocean) was a circular body surrounding nbwt (a term meaning "dry
lands" or "islands"), and therefore believed in a similar Ancient Near Eastern
circular Earth cosmography surrounded by water.[28][29][30]
The spherical form of the Earth was suggested by early Greek_philosophers, a
belief espoused by Pythagoras. Contrary to popular belief, most people in the
Middle_Ages did not believe the Earth was flat: this misconception is often
called the "Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth". As evidenced by thinkers such as Thomas
Aquinas, the European belief in a spherical_Earth was widespread by this point
in time.[31] Prior to circumnavigation of the planet and the introduction of
space_flight, belief in a spherical Earth was based on observations of the
secondary effects of the Earth's shape and parallels drawn with the shape of
other planets.[32]
***** Extraterrestrial land[edit] *****
Most planets known to humans are either gaseous Jovian_planets or solid
terrestrial_planets. Terrestrial planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and
Mars. These inner planets have a rocky surface with metal interiors.[33] The
Jovian planets consist of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. While these
planets are larger, their only land surface is a small rocky core surrounded by
a large, thick atmosphere.[34] The gas_giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are thought
to have surface layers composed of liquid_hydrogen rather than solid land;
however, their planetary_geology is not well understood. The possibility of
Uranus and Neptune (the ice_giants) possessing hot, highly compressed,
supercritical water under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised. While
their composition is still not fully understood, a 2006 study by Wiktorowicz et
al. ruled out the possibility of such a water "ocean" existing on Neptune,[35]
though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are
possible.[36] The entire surface of a rocky planet or moon is considered land,
even with a lack of seas or oceans for contrast. Planetary bodies that have a
thin atmosphere often have land that is marked by impact craters since
atmospheric conditions would normally break-down incoming objects and erode
rough impact sites.[37] Land on planetary bodies other than Earth can also be
bought and sold although ownership of extraterrestrial_real_estate is not
recognized by any authority.[38]
***** Land and climate[edit] *****
The land of the Earth interacts with and influences climate heavily since the
surface of the land heats up and cools down faster than air or water.[39]
Latitude, elevation, topography, reflectivity, and land_use all have varying
effects. The latitude of the land will influence how much solar_radiation
reaches the surface. High latitudes receive less solar radiation than low
latitudes.[39] The height of the land is important in creating and transforming
airflow and precipitation on Earth. Large landforms, such as mountain ranges,
divert wind energy and make the air parcel less dense and able to hold less
heat.[39] As air rises, this cooling effect causes condensation and
precipitation.
Reflectivity of the earth is called planetary albedo and the type of land cover
that receives energy from the sun affects the amount of energy that is
reflected or transferred to Earth.[40] Vegetation has a relatively low albedo
meaning that vegetated surfaces are good absorbers of the sun's energy. Forests
have an albedo of 10â15% while grasslands have an albedo of 15â20%. In
comparison, sandy deserts have an albedo of 25â40%.[40]
Land use by humans also plays a role in the regional and global climate.
Densely populated cities are warmer and create urban_heat_islands that have
effects on the precipitation, cloud cover, and temperature of the region.[39]
***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ The picture of the universe in Talmudic texts has the Earth in the
      center of creation with heaven as a hemisphere spread over it. Biblical
      writings, such as the Genesis creation story and the various Psalms that
      extol the firmament, the stars, the sun, and the earth, give similar
      explanations. The Hebrews saw the earth as an almost flat surface
      consisting of a solid and a liquid part and the sky as the realm of light
      in which heavenly bodies move. The earth rested on cornerstones and could
      not be moved except by Jehovah (as in an earthquake). According to the
      Hebrews, the sun and the moon were only a short distance from one
      another. "Cosmology." Encyclopedia Americana. Grolier Online, 2012.

   2. ^ The Earth is usually described as a disk encircled by water.
      Cosmological and metaphysical speculations were not to be cultivated in
      public nor were they to be committed to writing. Rather, they were
      considered to be "secrets of the Torah not to be passed on to all and
      sundry" (Ketubot 112a). While study of God's creation was not prohibited,
      speculations about "what is above, what is beneath, what is before, and
      what is after" (Mishnah Hagigah: 2) were restricted to the intellectual
      elite. (Topic Overview: Judaism, Encyclopedia of Science and Religion,
