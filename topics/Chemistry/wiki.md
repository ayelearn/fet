Chemistry is the scientific_discipline involved with elements and compounds
composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure,
properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other
substances.[1][2]
In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position
between physics and biology.[3] It is sometimes called the_central_science
because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied
scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.[4] For example, chemistry
explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks
(geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are
degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (astrophysics), how
medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime
scene (forensics).
Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via
chemical_bonds to form new chemical_compounds. There are four types of chemical
bonds: covalent bonds, in which compounds share one or more electron(s); ionic
bonds, in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to
produce ions (cations and anions); hydrogen_bonds; and Van_der_Waals_force
bonds.

***** Etymology *****
The word chemistry comes from alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of
practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy,
astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine. It is often seen as linked to the
quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold,[5] though in
ancient times the study encompassed many of the questions of modern chemistry
being defined as the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth,
embodying, disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the
spirits within bodies by the early 4th century Greek-Egyptian alchemist
Zosimos.[6] An alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later
the suffix "-ry" was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as
"chemistry".
The modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kÄ«mÄ«Ä
(Ø§ÙÙÛÙÛØ§Ø¡). In origin, the term is borrowed from the Greek ÏÎ·Î¼Î¯Î±
or ÏÎ·Î¼ÎµÎ¯Î±.[7][8] This may have Egyptian origins since al-kÄ«mÄ«Ä is
derived from the Greek ÏÎ·Î¼Î¯Î±, which is in turn derived from the word
Kemet, which is the ancient name of Egypt in the Egyptian_language.[7]
Alternately, al-kÄ«mÄ«Ä may derive from ÏÎ·Î¼ÎµÎ¯Î±, meaning "cast together".

***** Modern principles *****
Laboratory, Institute of Biochemistry, University_of_Cologne in Germany.
The current model of atomic structure is the quantum_mechanical_model.[10]
Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary_particles, atoms,
molecules,[11] substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter.
This matter can be studied in solid, liquid, or gas states, in isolation or in
combination. The interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied
in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to
rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors
are studied in a chemistry laboratory.
The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory
glassware. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of
experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.

nitric_acid, illuminated in different colors
A chemical_reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more
different substances.[12] The basis of such a chemical transformation is the
rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be
symbolically depicted through a chemical_equation, which usually involves atoms
as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for
a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is
unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear_reaction or radioactive
decay.) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy
changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as
chemical laws.
Energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all
chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their
structure, phase, as well as their chemical_compositions. They can be analyzed
using the tools of chemical_analysis, e.g. spectroscopy and chromatography.
Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists.[13] Most
chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. Several concepts are
essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:[14]
**** Matter ****
Main article: Matter
In chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest_mass and volume (it
takes up space) and is made up of particles. The particles that make up matter
have rest mass as well â not all particles have rest mass, such as the
photon. Matter can be a pure chemical_substance or a mixture of substances.[15]
*** Atom ***
Main article: Atom
A diagram of an atom based on the Bohr_model
The atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the
atomic_nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron_cloud. The nucleus
is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together
called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged
electrons which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged
electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense;
the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the
radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.[16][17]
The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the
chemical_properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization
potential, preferred oxidation_state(s), coordination_number, and preferred
types of bonds to form (e.g., metallic, ionic, covalent).
*** Element ***
Standard form of the periodic_table of chemical elements. The colors represent
different categories of elements
Main article: Chemical_element
A chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of
atom, characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its
atoms, known as the atomic_number and represented by the symbol Z. The mass
number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus. Although
all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic
number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element
which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes. For example, all atoms
with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon, but
atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.[17]
The standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic_table,
which orders elements by atomic number. The periodic table is arranged in
groups, or columns, and periods, or rows. The periodic table is useful in
identifying periodic_trends.[18]
*** Compound ***
Carbon_dioxide (CO2), an example of a chemical compound
Main article: Chemical_compound
A compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element. The
properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements.[19]
The standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the International_Union_of
Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry (IUPAC). Organic_compounds are named according to
the organic_nomenclature system.[20] The names for inorganic_compounds are
created according to the inorganic_nomenclature system. When a compound has
more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the
electropositive and the electronegative components.[21] In addition the
Chemical_Abstracts_Service has devised a method to index chemical substances.
In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its
CAS_registry_number.
*** Molecule ***
Main article: Molecule
A ball-and-stick representation of the caffeine molecule (C8H10N4O2).
A molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical_substance
that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to
undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. However,
this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules,
which is not true of many substances (see below). Molecules are typically a set
of atoms bound together by covalent_bonds, such that the structure is
electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons
either in bonds or in lone_pairs.
Thus, molecules exist as electrically neutral units, unlike ions. When this
rule is broken, giving the "molecule" a charge, the result is sometimes named a
molecular_ion or a polyatomic ion. However, the discrete and separate nature of
the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in
well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass
spectrometer. Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example,
common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered "molecules" in
chemistry. Some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating
radicals. Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric
oxide (NO) can be stable.
A 2-D skeletal_model of a benzene molecule (C6H6)
The "inert" or noble_gas_elements (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and
radon) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit, but the
other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of
atoms bonded to each other in some way. Identifiable molecules compose familiar
substances such as water, air, and many organic compounds like alcohol, sugar,
gasoline, and the various pharmaceuticals.
However, not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete
molecules, and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid
crust, mantle, and core of the Earth are chemical compounds without molecules.
These other types of substances, such as ionic_compounds and network_solids,
are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules
per se. Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of formula_units or
unit_cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance. Examples
of such substances are mineral salts (such as table_salt), solids like carbon
and diamond, metals, and familiar silica and silicate_minerals such as quartz
and granite.
One of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its
structure. While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra-atomic molecules
may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic
molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements)
can be crucial for its chemical nature.
*** Substance and mixture ***

[Diamants_maclÃ©s_2(RÃ©publique_d'Afrique_du_Sud).jpg] [Sugar_2xmacro.jpg]
[Sal_(close).jpg] [Sodium_bicarbonate.jpg]
Examples of pure chemical substances. From left to right: the elements tin
(Sn) and sulfur (S), diamond (an allotrope of carbon), sucrose (pure sugar),
and sodium_chloride (salt) and sodium_bicarbonate (baking soda), which are
both ionic compounds.
A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of
properties.[22] A collection of substances is called a mixture. Examples of
mixtures are air and alloys.[23]
*** Mole and amount of substance ***
Main article: Mole
The mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount_of_substance (also
called chemical amount). The mole is defined as the number of atoms found in
exactly 0.012 kilogram (or 12 grams) of carbon-12, where the carbon-12 atoms
are unbound, at rest and in their ground_state.[24] The number of entities per
mole is known as the Avogadro_constant, and is determined empirically to be
approximately 6.022Ã1023 molâ1.[25] Molar_concentration is the amount of a
particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in mol/
dm3.[26]
**** Phase ****
Diagram showing relationships among the phases and the terms used to describe
phase changes.
Main article: Phase
In addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different
chemical classifications, chemicals can exist in several phases. For the most
part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase
classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain
chemical properties. A phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have
similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as
pressure or temperature.
Physical properties, such as density and refractive_index tend to fall within
values characteristic of the phase. The phase of matter is defined by the phase
transition, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into
rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk
conditions.
Sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a
discrete boundary' in this case the matter is considered to be in a
supercritical state. When three states meet based on the conditions, it is
known as a triple_point and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to
define a set of conditions.
The most familiar examples of phases are solids, liquids, and gases. Many
substances exhibit multiple solid phases. For example, there are three phases
of solid iron (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and
pressure. A principal difference between solid phases is the crystal_structure,
or arrangement, of the atoms. Another phase commonly encountered in the study
of chemistry is the aqueous phase, which is the state of substances dissolved
in aqueous_solution (that is, in water).
Less familiar phases include plasmas, BoseâEinstein_condensates and fermionic
condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic
materials. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it
is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has
received attention for its relevance to systems in biology.
**** Bonding ****
Main article: Chemical_bond
An animation of the process of ionic bonding between sodium (Na) and chlorine
(Cl) to form sodium_chloride, or common table salt. Ionic bonding involves one
atom taking valence electrons from another (as opposed to sharing, which occurs
in covalent bonding)
Atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one
another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the
positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.
[27] More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions
characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.
A chemical bond can be a covalent_bond, an ionic_bond, a hydrogen_bond or just
because of Van_der_Waals_force. Each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to
some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms
together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence_bond
theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the
concept of oxidation_number can be used to explain molecular structure and
composition.
An ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons,
becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the
non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged
ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of
attraction between them. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron
to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron
to become Clâ. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction,
and that compound sodium_chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.
In the methane molecule (CH4), the carbon atom shares a pair of valence
electrons with each of the four hydrogen atoms. Thus, the octet rule is
satisfied for C-atom (it has eight electrons in its valence shell) and the duet
rule is satisfied for the H-atoms (they have two electrons in their valence
shells).
In a covalent bond, one or more pairs of valence_electrons are shared by two
atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a
molecule. Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble
gas electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each
atom. Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight
electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet_rule. However,
some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their
outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to
follow the duet rule, and in this way they are reaching the electron
configuration of the noble gas helium, which has two electrons in its outer
shell.
Similarly, theories from classical_physics can be used to predict many ionic
structures. With more complicated compounds, such as metal_complexes, valence
bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the
molecular_orbital theory, are generally used. See diagram on electronic
orbitals.
**** Energy ****
Main article: Energy
In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a
consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical
transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of
structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy
of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings
and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the
products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.
A reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy
scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic_reactions the situation
is the reverse. A reaction is said to be exothermic if the reaction releases
heat to the surroundings; in the case of endothermic_reactions, the reaction
absorbs heat from the surroundings.
Chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an
energy barrier known as the activation_energy. The speed of a chemical reaction
(at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the
Boltzmann's population factor      e  &#x2212; E  /  k T     {\displaystyle e^
{-E/kT}}  [e^{-E/kT} ] â that is the probability of a molecule to have energy
greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential
dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius
equation. The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can
be in the form of heat, light, electricity or mechanical force in the form of
ultrasound.[28]
A related concept free_energy, which also incorporates entropy considerations,
is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and
determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in chemical
thermodynamics. A reaction is feasible only if the total change in the Gibbs
free_energy is negative,     &#x0394; G &#x2264; 0    {\displaystyle \Delta
G\leq 0\,}  [ \Delta G \le 0 \,]; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction
is said to be at equilibrium.
There exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and
molecules. These are determined by the rules of quantum_mechanics, which
require quantization of energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a
higher energy state are said to be excited. The molecules/atoms of substance in
an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to
chemical reactions.
The phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy
of its surroundings. When the intermolecular_forces of a substance are such
that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it
occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water
(H2O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen
bonds.[29] Whereas hydrogen_sulfide (H2S) is a gas at room temperature and
standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole-dipole
interactions.
The transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the
size of energy quanta emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often
transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the
phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance
have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer.
Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced
than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between
substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example,
ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy
from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.
The existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical_substances
is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral_lines. Different
kinds of spectra are often used in chemical spectroscopy, e.g. IR, microwave,
NMR, ESR, etc. Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote
objects â like stars and distant galaxies â by analyzing their radiation
spectra.
Emission spectrum of iron
The term chemical_energy is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical
substance to undergo a transformation through a chemical_reaction or to
transform other chemical substances.
**** Reaction ****
Main article: Chemical_reaction
During chemical reactions, bonds between atoms break and form, resulting in
different substances with different properties. In a blast furnace, iron oxide,
a compound, reacts with carbon monoxide to form iron, one of the chemical
elements, and carbon dioxide.
When a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with
another substance or with energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred.
A chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the "reaction" of a
substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or
a solution; exposure to some form of energy, or both. It results in some energy
exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system
environment, which may be designed vesselsâoften laboratory_glassware.
Chemical reactions can result in the formation or dissociation of molecules,
that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more molecules or
rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually
involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds. Oxidation,_reduction,
dissociation, acid-base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some of
the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions.
A chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a chemical_equation.
While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both
sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only
for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.[30]
The sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be
taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism. A
chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of
which may have a different speed. Many reaction_intermediates with variable
stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction
mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of
a reaction. Many physical_chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the
mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the
WoodwardâHoffmann_rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a
chemical reaction.
According to the IUPAC gold book, a chemical reaction is "a process that
results in the interconversion of chemical species."[31] Accordingly, a
chemical reaction may be an elementary_reaction or a stepwise_reaction. An
additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the
interconversion_of_conformers is experimentally observable. Such detectable
chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by
this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also
for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. 'microscopic chemical
events').
**** Ions and salts ****
The crystal lattice structure of potassium_chloride (KCl), a salt which is
formed due to the attraction of K+ cations and Clâ anions. Note how the
overall charge of the ionic compound is zero.
Main article: Ion
An ion is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one
or more electrons. When an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons
than electrons, the atom is a positively charged ion or cation. When an atom
gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons, the atom is a
negatively charged ion or anion. Cations and anions can form a crystalline
lattice of neutral salts, such as the Na+ and Clâ ions forming sodium
chloride, or NaCl. Examples of polyatomic_ions that do not split up during
acid-base_reactions are hydroxide (OHâ) and phosphate (PO43â).
Plasma is composed of gaseous matter that has been completely ionized, usually
through high temperature.
**** Acidity and basicity ****
When hydrogen_bromide (HBr), pictured, is dissolved in water, it forms the
strong acid hydrobromic_acid
Main article: Acidâbase_reaction
A substance can often be classified as an acid or a base. There are several
different theories which explain acid-base behavior. The simplest is Arrhenius
theory, which states that acid is a substance that produces hydronium_ions when
it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces hydroxide_ions when
dissolved in water. According to BrÃ¸nstedâLowry_acid-base_theory, acids are
substances that donate a positive hydrogen ion to another substance in a
chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that
hydrogen ion.
A third common theory is Lewis_acid-base_theory, which is based on the
formation of new chemical bonds. Lewis theory explains that an acid is a
substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another
substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance
which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond. According to this
theory, the crucial things being exchanged are charges.[32] There are several
other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is
evident in the history of this concept.[33]
Acid strength is commonly measured by two methods. One measurement, based on
the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is pH, which is a measurement of the
hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative
logarithmic scale. Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion
concentration and can be said to be more acidic. The other measurement, based
on the BrÃ¸nstedâLowry definition, is the acid_dissociation_constant (Ka),
which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the
BrÃ¸nstedâLowry definition of an acid. That is, substances with a higher Ka
are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with
lower Ka values.
**** Redox ****
Main article: Redox
Redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions include all chemical_reactions in which
atoms have their oxidation_state changed by either gaining electrons
(reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation). Substances that have the ability
to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing
agents, oxidants or oxidizers. An oxidant removes electrons from another
substance. Similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other
substances are said to be reductive and are known as reducing_agents,
reductants, or reducers.
A reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus oxidized
itself. And because it "donates" electrons it is also called an electron donor.
Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation numberâthe
actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is better defined
as an increase in oxidation_number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation
number.
**** Equilibrium ****
Main article: Chemical_equilibrium
Although the concept of equilibrium is widely used across sciences, in the
context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the
chemical composition are possible, as for example, in a mixture of several
chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be
present in more than one kind of phase.
A system of chemical substances at equilibrium, even though having an
unchanging composition, is most often not static; molecules of the substances
continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a dynamic_equilibrium.
Thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical
composition remain unchanged over time.
**** Chemical laws ****
Main article: Chemical_law
Chemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental
concepts in chemistry. Some of them are:
    * Avogadro's_law
    * BeerâLambert_law
    * Boyle's_law (1662, relating pressure and volume)
    * Charles's_law (1787, relating volume and temperature)
    * Fick's_laws_of_diffusion
    * Gay-Lussac's_law (1809, relating pressure and temperature)
    * Le_Chatelier's_principle
    * Henry's_law
    * Hess's_law
    * Law_of_conservation_of_energy leads to the important concepts of
      equilibrium, thermodynamics, and kinetics.
    * Law_of_conservation_of_mass continues to be conserved in isolated
      systems, even in modern physics. However, special_relativity shows that
      due to massâenergy_equivalence, whenever non-material "energy" (heat,
      light, kinetic energy) is removed from a non-isolated system, some mass
      will be lost with it. High energy losses result in loss of weighable
      amounts of mass, an important topic in nuclear_chemistry.
    * Law_of_definite_composition, although in many systems (notably
      biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers,
      and are frequently represented as a fraction.
    * Law_of_multiple_proportions
    * Raoult's_law
***** History *****
Main article: History_of_chemistry
The history_of_chemistry spans a period from very old times to the present.
Since several millennia BC, civilizations were using technologies that would
eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry. Examples
include extracting metals from ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer
and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering
fat into soap, making glass, and making alloys like bronze. Chemistry was
preceded by its protoscience, alchemy, which is an intuitive but non-scientific
approach to understanding the constituents of matter and their interactions. It
was unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations,
but, by performing experiments and recording the results, alchemists set the
stage for modern chemistry. Chemistry as a body of knowledge distinct from
alchemy began to emerge when a clear differentiation was made between them by
Robert_Boyle in his work The_Sceptical_Chymist (1661). While both alchemy and
chemistry are concerned with matter and its transformations, the crucial
difference was given by the scientific_method that chemists employed in their
work. Chemistry is considered to have become an established science with the
work of Antoine_Lavoisier, who developed a law of conservation_of_mass that
demanded careful measurement and quantitative observations of chemical
phenomena. The history of chemistry is intertwined with the history_of
thermodynamics, especially through the work of Willard_Gibbs.[34]
**** Of definition ****
The definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and
theories add to the functionality of the science. The term "chymistry", in the
view of noted scientist Robert_Boyle in 1661, meant the subject of the material
principles of mixed bodies.[35] In 1663, the chemist Christopher_Glaser
described "chymistry" as a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve
bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and
how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection.[36]
The 1730 definition of the word "chemistry", as used by Georg_Ernst_Stahl,
meant the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their
principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles.[37] In 1837,
Jean-Baptiste_Dumas considered the word "chemistry" to refer to the science
concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces.[38] This definition
further evolved until, in 1947, it came to mean the science of substances:
their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into
other substances â a characterization accepted by Linus_Pauling.[39] More
recently, in 1998, Professor Raymond_Chang broadened the definition of
"chemistry" to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.[40]

Main article: History_of_chemistry
See also: Alchemy and Timeline_of_chemistry
Democritus' atomist philosophy was later adopted by Epicurus (341â270 BCE).
Early civilizations, such as the Egyptians[41] Babylonians, Indians[42] amassed
practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy, pottery and dyes, but
didn't develop a systematic theory.
A basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in Classical_Greece with the theory
of four_elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire,
air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything is
formed as a combination. Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works
by philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus. In 50 BCE, the Roman
philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De_rerum_natura (On
The Nature of Things).[43][44] Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism
was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical
observations and no concern for chemical experiments.[45]
An early form of the idea of conservation_of_mass is the notion that "Nothing
comes_from_nothing" in Ancient_Greek_philosophy, which can be found in
Empedocles (approx. 4th century BC): "For it is impossible for anything to come
to be from what is not, and it cannot be brought about or heard of that what is
should be utterly destroyed."[46] and Epicurus (3rd century BC), who,
describing the nature of the Universe, wrote that "the totality of things was
always such as it is now, and always will be".[47]
In the Hellenistic_world the art of alchemy first proliferated, mingling magic
and occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of
transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal life.[48]
Work, particularly the development of distillation, continued in the early
Byzantine period with the most famous practitioner being the 4th century Greek-
Egyptian Zosimos_of_Panopolis.[49] Alchemy continued to be developed and
practised throughout the Arab_world after the Muslim_conquests,[50] and from
there, and from the Byzantine remnants,[51] diffused into medieval and
Renaissance Europe through Latin translations.
JÄbir_ibn_HayyÄn (Geber), a Perso-Arab_alchemist whose experimental research
laid the foundations of chemistry.
The development of the modern scientific_method was slow and arduous, but an
early scientific method for chemistry began emerging among early Muslim
chemists, beginning with the 9th century Perso-Arab chemist JÄbir_ibn_HayyÄn
(known as "Geber" in Europe), who is sometimes referred to as "the father of
chemistry".[52][53][54][55] He introduced a systematic and experimental
approach to scientific research based in the laboratory, in contrast to the
ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were largely allegorical and
often unintelligible.[56] He also introduced the alembic (al-anbiq) of Persian
encyclopedist Ibn_al-Awwam to Europe, chemically analyzed many chemical
substances, composed lapidaries, distinguished between alkalis and acids, and
manufactured hundreds of drugs.[57] His books strongly influenced the medieval
European alchemists[58] and justified their search for the philosopher's_stone.
[59][60] In the Middle_Ages, Jabir's treatises on alchemy were translated_into
Latin and became standard texts for European alchemists. These include the
Kitab_al-Kimya (titled Book of the Composition of Alchemy in Europe),
translated by Robert_of_Chester (1144); and the Kitab al-Sab'een (Book of
Seventy) by Gerard_of_Cremona (before 1187). Later influential Muslim
philosophers, such as AbÅ«_al-RayhÄn_al-BÄ«rÅ«nÄ«,[61] Avicenna[62] and Al-
Kindi disputed the theories of alchemy, particularly the theory of the
transmutation_of_metals; and al-Tusi described a version of the conservation_of
mass, noting that a body of matter is able to change but is not able to
disappear.[63]
Under the influence of the new_empirical_methods propounded by Sir_Francis
Bacon and others, a group of chemists at Oxford, Robert_Boyle, Robert_Hooke and
John_Mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific
discipline. Boyle in particular is regarded as the founding father of chemistry
due to his most important work, the classic chemistry text The_Sceptical
Chymist where the differentiation is made between the claims of alchemy and the
empirical scientific discoveries of the new chemistry.[64] He formulated
Boyle's_law, rejected the classical "four elements" and proposed a mechanistic
alternative of atoms and chemical_reactions that could be subject to rigorous
experiment.[65]
Antoine-Laurent_de_Lavoisier is considered the "Father of Modern Chemistry".
[66]
The theory of phlogiston (a substance at the root of all combustion) was
propounded by the German Georg_Ernst_Stahl in the early 18th century and was
only overturned by the end of the century by the French chemist Antoine
Lavoisier, the chemical analogue of Newton in physics; who did more than any
other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by
elucidating the principle of conservation_of_mass and developing a new system
of chemical nomenclature used to this day.[67]
Before his work, though, many important discoveries had been made, specifically
relating to the nature of 'air' which was discovered to be composed of many
different gases. The Scottish chemist Joseph_Black (the first experimental
chemist) and the Dutchman J.B._van_Helmont discovered carbon_dioxide, or what
Black called 'fixed air' in 1754; Henry_Cavendish discovered hydrogen and
elucidated its properties and Joseph_Priestley and, independently, Carl_Wilhelm
Scheele isolated pure oxygen.
In his periodic table, Dmitri_Mendeleev predicted the existence of 7 new
elements,[68] and placed all 60 elements known at the time in their correct
places.[69]
English scientist John_Dalton proposed the modern theory_of_atoms; that all
substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and that different
atoms have varying atomic weights.
The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred
in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in
particular, J.J._Berzelius and Humphry_Davy, made possible by the prior
invention of the voltaic_pile by Alessandro_Volta. Davy discovered nine new
elements including the alkali_metals by extracting them from their oxides with
electric current.[70]
British William_Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic
weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic
weight of hydrogen. J.A.R._Newlands devised an early table of elements, which
was then developed into the modern periodic_table of elements[71] in the 1860s
by Dmitri_Mendeleev and independently by several other scientists including
Julius_Lothar_Meyer.[72][73] The inert gases, later called the noble_gases were
discovered by William_Ramsay in collaboration with Lord_Rayleigh at the end of
the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.
Top: Expected results: alpha_particles passing through the plum_pudding_model
of the atom undisturbed.
Bottom: Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected,
indicating a_small,_concentrated_charge.
At the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry
were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that
succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure
of atoms. In 1897, J.J._Thomson of Cambridge_University discovered the electron
and soon after the French scientist Becquerel as well as the couple Pierre and
Marie_Curie investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity. In a series of
pioneering scattering experiments Ernest_Rutherford at the University_of
Manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of
the proton, classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and
successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha
particles.
His work on atomic structure was improved on by his students, the Danish
physicist Niels_Bohr and Henry_Moseley. The electronic theory of chemical_bonds
and molecular_orbitals was developed by the American scientists Linus_Pauling
and Gilbert_N._Lewis.
The year 2011 was declared by the United Nations as the International Year of
Chemistry.[74] It was an initiative of the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry, and of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization and involves chemical societies, academics, and
institutions worldwide and relied on individual initiatives to organize local
and regional activities.
Organic chemistry was developed by Justus_von_Liebig and others, following
Friedrich_WÃ¶hler's synthesis of urea which proved that living organisms were,
in theory, reducible to chemistry.[75] Other crucial 19th century advances
were; an understanding of valence bonding (Edward_Frankland in 1852) and the
application of thermodynamics to chemistry (J._W._Gibbs and Svante_Arrhenius in
the 1870s).

                        This article relies largely or entirely on a single
[Question_book-new.svg] source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk

Chemistry is typically divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are
also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.
[76]
    * Analytical_chemistry is the analysis of material samples to gain an
      understanding of their chemical_composition and structure. Analytical
      chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry.
      These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding
      purely theoretical chemistry.
    * Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals, chemical_reactions and
      chemical_interactions that take place in living organisms. Biochemistry
      and organic chemistry are closely related, as in medicinal_chemistry or
      neurochemistry. Biochemistry is also associated with molecular_biology
      and genetics.
    * Inorganic_chemistry is the study of the properties and reactions of
      inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic
      disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly
      in the sub-discipline of organometallic_chemistry.
    * Materials_chemistry is the preparation, characterization, and
      understanding of substances with a useful function. The field is a new
      breadth of study in graduate programs, and it integrates elements from
      all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that
      are unique to materials. Primary systems of study include the chemistry
      of condensed phases (solids, liquids, polymers) and interfaces between
      different phases.
    * Neurochemistry is the study of neurochemicals; including transmitters,
      peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids; their
      interactions, and the roles they play in forming, maintaining, and
      modifying the nervous system.
    * Nuclear_chemistry is the study of how subatomic particles come together
      and make nuclei. Modern Transmutation is a large component of nuclear
      chemistry, and the table_of_nuclides is an important result and tool for
      this field.
    * Organic_chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition,
      mechanisms, and reactions of organic_compounds. An organic compound is
      defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton.
    * Physical_chemistry is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of
      chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and
      dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical
      chemists. Important areas of study include chemical_thermodynamics,
      chemical_kinetics, electrochemistry, statistical_mechanics, spectroscopy,
      and more recently, astrochemistry.[77] Physical chemistry has large
      overlap with molecular_physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of
      infinitesimal_calculus in deriving equations. It is usually associated
      with quantum_chemistry and theoretical chemistry. Physical chemistry is a
      distinct discipline from chemical_physics, but again, there is very
      strong overlap.
    * Theoretical_chemistry is the study of chemistry via fundamental
      theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics). In
      particular the application of quantum_mechanics to chemistry is called
      quantum_chemistry. Since the end of the Second_World_War, the development
      of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational
      chemistry, which is the art of developing and applying computer_programs
      for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap
      with (theoretical and experimental) condensed_matter_physics and
      molecular_physics.
Other disciplines within chemistry are traditionally grouped by the type of
matter being studied or the kind of study. These include inorganic_chemistry,
the study of inorganic matter; organic_chemistry, the study of organic (carbon-
based) matter; biochemistry, the study of substances found in biological
organisms; physical_chemistry, the study of chemical processes using physical
concepts such as thermodynamics and quantum_mechanics; and analytical
chemistry, the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their
chemical_composition and structure. Many more specialized disciplines have
emerged in recent years, e.g. neurochemistry the chemical study of the nervous
system (see subdisciplines).
Other fields include agrochemistry, astrochemistry (and cosmochemistry),
atmospheric_chemistry, chemical_engineering, chemical_biology, chemo-
informatics, electrochemistry, environmental_chemistry, femtochemistry, flavor
chemistry, flow_chemistry, geochemistry, green_chemistry, histochemistry,
history_of_chemistry, hydrogenation_chemistry, immunochemistry, marine
chemistry, materials_science, mathematical_chemistry, mechanochemistry,
medicinal_chemistry, molecular_biology, molecular_mechanics, nanotechnology,
natural_product_chemistry, oenology, organometallic_chemistry, petrochemistry,
pharmacology, photochemistry, physical_organic_chemistry, phytochemistry,
polymer_chemistry, radiochemistry, solid-state_chemistry, sonochemistry,
supramolecular_chemistry, surface_chemistry, synthetic_chemistry,
thermochemistry, and many others.

           To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir's alchemy and
           to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to
           compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature
           in the Greek language. One knows in which miserable state this
           literature reached us. Collected by Byzantine_scientists from
           the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a
           cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times
           since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.
           "The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in
           this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later
           researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen,
           Tannery, Lagercrantz, von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez,
           Festugiere and others, could make clear only few points of
           detailâ¦
           The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging. An
           even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very
           small part only was organized according to true experiments of
           laboratory: even the supposedly technical writings, in the
           state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense
           which refuses any interpretation.
           It is different with Jabir's alchemy. The relatively clear
           description of the processes and the alchemical apparatuses,
           the methodical classification of the substances, mark an
           experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird
           and odd esotericism of the Greek texts. The theory on which
           Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an
           impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one
           notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and
           practical teaching, between the `ilm and the `amal. In vain one
           would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that
           which is presented for example in the Book of Seventy."
