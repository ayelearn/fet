Galvanic cell with no cation flow
A galvanic cell or voltaic cell, named after Luigi_Galvani or Alessandro_Volta,
respectively, is an electrochemical_cell that derives electrical energy from
spontaneous redox reactions taking place within the cell. It generally consists
of two different metals immersed in an electrolyte, or of individual half-cells
with different metals and their ions in solution connected by a salt_bridge or
separated by a porous membrane.
Volta was the inventor of the voltaic_pile, the first electrical_battery. In
common usage, the word "battery" has come to include a single galvanic cell,
but a battery properly consists of multiple cells.[1]

***** History[edit] *****
In 1780, Luigi_Galvani discovered that when two different metals (e.g., copper
and zinc) are in contact and then both are touched at the same time to two
different parts of a muscle of a frog leg, to close the circuit, the frog's leg
contracts.[2] He called this "animal_electricity". The frog's leg, as well as
being a detector of electrical current, was also the electrolyte (to use the
language of modern chemistry).
A year after Galvani published his work (1790), Alessandro_Volta showed that
the frog was not necessary, using instead a force-based detector and brine-
soaked paper (as electrolyte). (Earlier Volta had established the law of
capacitance C = Q/V with force-based detectors). In 1799 Volta invented the
voltaic pile, which is a pile of galvanic cells each consisting of a metal
disk, an electrolyte layer, and a disk of a different metal. He built it
entirely out of non-biological material to challenge Galvani's (and the later
experimenter Leopoldo_Nobili)'s animal electricity theory in favor of his own
metal-metal contact electricity theory.[3] Carlo_Matteucci in his turn
constructed a battery_entirely_out_of_biological_material in answer to Volta.
[4] Volta's contact electricity view characterized each electrode with a number
that we would now call the work function of the electrode. This view ignored
the chemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, which include
H2_formation on the more noble metal in Volta's pile.
Although Volta did not understand the operation of the battery or the galvanic
cell, these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries; Volta's cell
was named an IEEE_Milestone in 1999.[5]
Some forty years later, Faraday (see Faraday's_laws_of_electrolysis) showed
that the galvanic cell -- now often called a voltaic cell -- was chemical in
nature. Faraday introduced new terminology to the language of chemistry:
electrode (cathode and anode), electrolyte, and ion (cation and anion). Thus
Galvani incorrectly thought the source of electricity (or source of emf, or
seat of emf) was in the animal, Volta incorrectly thought it was in the
physical properties of the isolated electrodes, but Faraday correctly
identified the source of emf as the chemical reactions at the two electrode-
electrolyte interfaces. The authoritative work on the intellectual history of
the voltaic cell remains that by Ostwald.[6]
It was suggested by Wilhelm_KÃ¶nig in 1940 that the object known as the Baghdad
battery might represent galvanic cell technology from ancient Parthia. Replicas
filled with citric acid or grape juice have been shown to produce a voltage.
However, it is far from certain that this was its purposeâother scholars have
pointed out that it is very similar to vessels known to have been used for
storing parchment scrolls.[7]
***** Basic description[edit] *****
Schematic of Zn-Cu galvanic cell
In its simplest form, a half-cell consists of a solid metal (called an
electrode) that is submerged in a solution; the solution contains cations (+)
of the electrode metal and anions (â) to balance the charge of the cations.
The full cell consists of two half-cells, usually connected by a semi-permeable
membrane or by a salt_bridge that prevents the ions of the more noble metal
from plating out at the other electrode.
A specific example is the Daniell_cell (see figure), with a zinc (Zn) half-cell
containing a solution of ZnSO4 (zinc sulfate) and a copper (Cu) half-cell
containing a solution of CuSO4 (copper sulfate). A salt bridge is used here to
complete the electric circuit.
If an external electrical conductor connects the copper and zinc electrodes,
zinc from the zinc electrode dissolves into the solution as Zn2+ ions
(oxidation), releasing electrons that enter the external conductor. To
compensate for the increased zinc ion concentration, via the salt bridge zinc
ions leave and anions enter the zinc half-cell. In the copper half-cell, the
copper ions plate onto the copper electrode (reduction), taking up electrons
that leave the external conductor. Since the Cu2+ ions (cations) plate onto the
copper electrode, the latter is called the cathode. Correspondingly the zinc
electrode is the anode. The electrochemical reaction is:
      Zn + Cu2+ â Zn2+ + Cu
In addition, electrons flow through the external conductor, which is the
primary application of the galvanic cell.
As discussed under #Cell_voltage, the emf of the cell is the difference of the
half-cell potentials, a measure of the relative ease of dissolution of the two
electrodes into the electrolyte. The emf depends on both the electrodes and on
the electrolyte, an indication that the emf is chemical in nature.
***** Electrochemical thermodynamics of galvanic cell reactions[edit] *****
The electrochemical processes in a galvanic cell occur because reactants of
high free energy (e.g. metallic Zn and hydrated Cu2+ in the Daniell cell) are
converted to lower-energy products (metallic Cu and hydrated Zn2+ in this
example). The difference in the lattice cohesive energies [8] of the electrode
metals is sometimes the dominant energetic driver of the reaction, specifically
in the Daniell cell.[9] Metallic Zn, Cd, Li, and Na, which are not stabilized
by d-orbital bonding, have higher cohesive energies (i.e. they are more weakly
bonded) than all transition_metals, including Cu, and are therefore useful as
high-energy anode metals.[9]
The difference between the metals' ionization energies in water [9] is the
other energetic contribution that can drive the reaction in a galvanic cell; it
is not important in the Daniell cell because the energies of hydrated Cu2+ and
Zn2+ ions happen to be similar.[9] Both atom transfer, e.g. of zinc from the
metal electrode into the solution, and electron transfer, from metal atoms or
to metal ions, play important roles in a galvanic cell. Concentration_cells,
whose electrodes and ions are made of the same metal and which are driven by an
entropy increase and free-energy decrease as ion concentrations equalize, show
that the electronegativity difference of the metals is not the driving force of
electrochemical processes.
Galvanic cells and batteries are typically used as a source of electrical
power. The energy derives from a high-cohesive-energy metal dissolving while to
a lower-energy metal is deposited, and/or from high-energy metal ions plating
out while lower-energy ions go into solution.
Quantitatively, the electrical energy produced by a galvanic cell is
approximately equal to the standard free-energy difference of the reactants and
products, denoted as ÎrGo. In the Daniell cell, most of the electrical energy
of ÎrGo = -213 kJ/mol can be attributed to the -207 kJ/mol difference between
Zn and Cu lattice cohesive energies.[9]
***** Half reactions and conventions[edit] *****
A half-cell contains a metal in two oxidation_states. Inside an isolated half-
cell, there is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction that is in chemical
equilibrium, a condition written symbolically as follows (here, "M" represents
a metal cation, an atom that has a charge imbalance due to the loss of "n"
electrons):
      Mn+ (oxidized species) + neâ â M (reduced species)
A galvanic cell consists of two half-cells, such that the electrode of one
half-cell is composed of metal A, and the electrode of the other half-cell is
composed of metal B; the redox reactions for the two separate half-cells are
thus:
      An+ + neâ â A
      Bm+ + meâ â B
The overall balanced reaction is
      m A + n Bm+ â n B + m An+
In other words, the metal atoms of one half-cell are oxidized while the metal
cations of the other half-cell are reduced. By separating the metals in two
half-cells, their reaction can be controlled in a way that forces transfer of
electrons through the external circuit where they can do useful work.
    * The electrodes are connected with a metal wire in order to conduct the
      electrons that participate in the reaction.
      In one half-cell, dissolved metal-B cations combine with the free
      electrons that are available at the interface between the solution and
      the metal-B electrode; these cations are thereby neutralized, causing
      them to precipitate from solution as deposits on the metal-B electrode, a
      process known as plating.
      This reduction reaction causes the free electrons throughout the metal-
      B electrode, the wire, and the metal-A electrode to be pulled into the
      metal-B electrode. Consequently, electrons are wrestled away from some of
      the atoms of the metal-A electrode, as though the metal-B cations were
      reacting directly with them; those metal-A atoms become cations that
      dissolve into the surrounding solution.
      As this reaction continues, the half-cell with the metal-A electrode
      develops a positively charged solution (because the metal-A cations
      dissolve into it), while the other half-cell develops a negatively
      charged solution (because the metal-B cations precipitate out of it,
      leaving behind the anions); unabated, this imbalance in charge would stop
      the reaction. The solutions of the half-cells are connected by a salt
      bridge or a porous plate that allows ions to pass from one solution to
      the other, which balances the charges of the solutions and allows the
      reaction to continue.
By definition:
    * The anode is the electrode where oxidation (loss of electrons) takes
      place (metal-A electrode); in a galvanic cell, it is the negative
      electrode, because when oxidation occurs, electrons are left behind on
      the electrode.[10] These electrons then flow through the external circuit
      to the cathode (positive electrode) (while in electrolysis, an electric
      current drives electron flow in the opposite direction and the anode is
      the positive electrode).
    * The cathode is the electrode where reduction (gain of electrons) takes
      place (metal-B electrode); in a galvanic cell, it is the positive
      electrode, as ions get reduced by taking up electrons from the electrode
      and plate out (while in electrolysis, the cathode is the negative
      terminal and attracts positive ions from the solution). In both cases,
      the statement 'the cathode attracts cations' is true.
Galvanic cells, by their nature, produce direct_current. The Weston_cell has an
anode composed of cadmium mercury amalgam, and a cathode composed of pure
mercury. The electrolyte is a (saturated) solution of cadmium_sulfate. The
depolarizer is a paste of mercurous sulfate. When the electrolyte solution is
saturated, the voltage of the cell is very reproducible; hence, in 1911, it was
adopted as an international standard for voltage.
A battery is a set of galvanic cells that are connected together to form a
single source of voltage. For instance, a typical 12V leadâacid_battery has
six galvanic cells connected in series with the anodes composed of lead and
cathodes composed of lead dioxide, both immersed in sulfuric acid. Large
battery_rooms, for instance in a telephone_exchange providing central office
power to user's telephones, may have cells connected in both series and
parallel.
***** Cell voltage[edit] *****
The voltage (electromotive force Eo) produced by a galvanic cell can be
estimated from the standard Gibbs free energy change in the electrochemical
reaction according to
    E  cell   o   = &#x2212;  &#x0394;  r    G  o    /  (  &#x03BD;  e   F )
{\displaystyle E_{\text{cell}}^{o}=-\Delta _{r}G^{o}/(\nu _{e}F)}  [
{\displaystyle E_{\text{cell}}^{o}=-\Delta _{r}G^{o}/(\nu _{e}F)}]
where Î½e is the number of electrons transferred in the balanced half
reactions, and F is Faraday's_constant. However, it can be determined more
conveniently by the use of a standard_potential_table for the two half_cells
involved. The first step is to identify the two metals and their ions reacting
in the cell. Then one looks up the standard_electrode_potential, Eo, in volts,
for each of the two half_reactions. The standard potential of the cell is equal
to the more positive Eo value minus the more negative Eo value.
For example, in the figure above the solutions are CuSO4 and ZnSO4. Each
solution has a corresponding metal strip in it, and a salt bridge or porous
disk connecting the two solutions and allowing SO2â
4 ions to flow freely between the copper and zinc solutions. To calculate the
standard potential one looks up copper and zinc's half reactions and finds:
      Cu2+ + 2
      e−
       â Cu   Eo = +0.34 V
      Zn2+ + 2
      e−
       â Zn   Eo = â0.76 V
Thus the overall reaction is:
      Cu2+ + Zn â Cu + Zn2+
The standard potential for the reaction is then +0.34 V â (â0.76 V) = 1.10
V. The polarity of the cell is determined as follows. Zinc metal is more
strongly reducing than copper metal because the standard (reduction) potential
for zinc is more negative than that of copper. Thus, zinc metal will lose
electrons to copper ions and develop a positive electrical charge. The
equilibrium_constant, K, for the cell is given by
         ln &#x2061; K =     &#x03BD;  e   F  E  cell   o     R T
      {\displaystyle \ln K={\frac {\nu _{e}FE_{\text{cell}}^{o}}{RT}}}  [
      {\displaystyle \ln K={\frac {\nu _{e}FE_{\text{cell}}^{o}}{RT}}}]
where F is the Faraday_constant, R is the gas_constant and T is the temperature
in kelvins. For the Daniell cell K is approximately equal to 1.5Ã1037. Thus,
at equilibrium, a few electrons are transferred, enough to cause the electrodes
to be charged.[11]
Actual half-cell potentials must be calculated by using the Nernst_equation as
the solutes are unlikely to be in their standard states,
          E  half-cell   =  E  o   &#x2212;    R T    &#x03BD;  e   F     ln  e
      &#x2061; Q   {\displaystyle E_{\text{half-cell}}=E^{o}-{\frac {RT}{\nu _
      {e}F}}\ln _{e}Q}  [{\displaystyle E_{\text{half-cell}}=E^{o}-{\frac {RT}
      {\nu _{e}F}}\ln _{e}Q}]
where Q is the reaction_quotient. When the charges of the ions in the reaction
are equal, this simplifies to
          E  half-cell   =  E  o   &#x2212; 2.303    R T    &#x03BD;  e   F
      log  10   &#x2061;  {   M   n +   }    {\displaystyle E_{\text{half-
      cell}}=E^{o}-2.303{\frac {RT}{\nu _{e}F}}\log _{10}\left\{{\text{M}}^
      {n+}\right\}}  [{\displaystyle E_{\text{half-cell}}=E^{o}-2.303{\frac
      {RT}{\nu _{e}F}}\log _{10}\left\{{\text{M}}^{n+}\right\}}]
where {Mn+} is the activity of the metal ion in solution. In practice
concentration in mol/L is used in place of activity. The metal electrode is in
its standard state so by definition has unit activity. The potential of the
whole cell is obtained as the difference between the potentials for the two
half-cells, so it depends on the concentrations of both dissolved metal ions.
If the concentrations are the same,      E  cell   =  E  cell   o
{\displaystyle E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{cell}}^{o}}  [{\displaystyle E_{\text
{cell}}=E_{\text{cell}}^{o}}]and the Nernst equation is not needed under the
conditions assumed here.
The value of 2.303R/F is 1.9845Ã10â4 V/K, so at 25 Â°C (298.15 K) the half-
cell potential will change by only 0.05918 V/Î½e if the concentration of a
metal ion is increased or decreased by a factor of 10.
          E  half-cell   =  E  o   &#x2212;    0.05918 &#xA0;  V    &#x03BD;  e
      log  10   &#x2061;  [   M   n +   ]    {\displaystyle E_{\text{half-
      cell}}=E^{o}-{\frac {0.05918\ {\text{V}}}{\nu _{e}}}\log _{10}\left[
      {\text{M}}^{n+}\right]}  [{\displaystyle E_{\text{half-cell}}=E^{o}-
      {\frac {0.05918\ {\text{V}}}{\nu _{e}}}\log _{10}\left[{\text{M}}^
      {n+}\right]}]
These calculations are based on the assumption that all chemical reactions are
in equilibrium. When a current flows in the circuit, equilibrium conditions are
not achieved and the cell voltage will usually be reduced by various
mechanisms, such as the development of overpotentials.[12] Also, since chemical
reactions occur when the cell is producing power, the electrolyte
concentrations change and the cell voltage is reduced. A consequence of the
temperature dependency of standard potentials is that the voltage produced by a
galvanic cell is also temperature dependent.
***** Galvanic corrosion[edit] *****
Main article: Galvanic_corrosion
Galvanic corrosion is a process that degrades metals electrochemically. This
corrosion occurs when two dissimilar metals are in contact with each other in
the presence of an electrolyte, such as salt water, forming a galvanic cell
with H2_formation on the more noble metal. The resulting electrochemical
potential then develops an electric current that electrolytically dissolves the
less noble material. A concentration_cell can be formed if the same metal is
exposed to two different concentrations of electrolyte.
