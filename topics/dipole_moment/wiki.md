            mechanics
          o Molecular_dipole_moment, the electric dipole moment of a molecule.
          o Bond_dipole_moment, the measure of polarity of a chemical bond
          o Electron_electric_dipole_moment, the measure of the charge
            distribution within an electron
    * Magnetic_dipole_moment, the measure of the magnetic polarity of a system
      of charges
          o Electron_magnetic_moment
