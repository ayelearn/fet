This article is about the physics of irradiation. For the visual illusion, see
irradiation_illusion.
Irradiation is the process by which an object is exposed to radiation. The
exposure can originate from various sources, including natural sources. Most
frequently the term refers to ionizing_radiation, and to a level of radiation
that will serve a specific purpose, rather than radiation exposure to normal
levels of background_radiation. The term irradiation usually excludes the
exposure to non-ionizing radiation, such as infrared, visible_light, microwaves
from cellular_phones or electromagnetic_waves emitted by radio and TV receivers
and power supplies.

***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Sterilization[edit] ****
If administered at appropriate levels, all forms of ionizing_radiation can
sterilize objects, including medical instruments, disposables such as syringes,
and sterilize_food. Ionizing radiation (electron_beams, X-rays and gamma_rays)
[1] may be used to kill bacteria in food or other organic material, including
blood.[citation_needed] Food_irradiation, while effective, is seldom used due
to problems with public acceptance.[2]
**** Medicine[edit] ****
Irradiation is used in diagnostic_imaging, cancer_therapy and blood
transfusion.[3]
In 2011 researchers found that irradiation was successful in the novel
theranostic technique involving co-treatment with heptamethine_dyes to
elucidate tumor cells and attenuate their growth with minimal side effects.[4]
[5]
**** Ion implantation[edit] ****
Main article: Ion_implantation
Ion irradiation is routinely used to implant impurities atoms into materials,
especially semiconductors, to modify their properties. This process, usually
known as ion_implantation, is an important step in the manufacture of silicon
integrated_circuits.
**** Ion irradiation[edit] ****
Ion irradiation means in general using particle accelerators to shoot energetic
ions on a material. Ion_implantation is a variety of ion irradiation, as is
swift_heavy_ions irradiation from particle_accelerators induces ion_tracks that
can be used for nanotechnology.
**** Industrial chemistry[edit] ****
Irradiation can be used to cross-link plastics or to improve material qualities
of semi-precious_stones. Due to its efficiency, electron_beam_processing is
often used in the irradiation treatment of polymer-based products to improve
their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties, and often to add unique
properties. Cross-linked_polyethylene pipe (PEX), high-temperature products
such as tubing and gaskets, wire and cable jacket curing, curing of composite
materials, and crosslinking of tires are a few examples.
**** Security[edit] ****
During the 2001_anthrax_attacks, the US_Postal_Service irradiated_mail to
protect members of the US government and other possible targets. This was of
some concern to people who send digital media through the mail, including
artists. According to the ART in Embassies program, "incoming mail is
irradiated, and the process destroys slides, transparencies and disks."
[citation_needed]
**** Agriculture[edit] ****
Main article: Mutation_breeding
After its discovery by Lewis Stadler at the University_of_Missouri, irradiation
of seed and plant germplasm has resulted in creating many widely-grown
cultivars of food_crops worldwide.[6] The process, which consists of striking
plant seeds or germplasm with radiation in the form of X-rays, UV_waves, heavy-
ion_beams, or gamma_rays, essentially "mixes" the genes already existing in the
genome. The UN has been an active participant through the International_Atomic
Energy_Agency. Irradiation is also employed to prevent the sprouting of certain
cereals, onions, potatoes and garlic.[7] Appropriate irradiation doses are also
used to produce insects for use in the sterile_insect_technique of pest
control.[8]
Main article: Food_irradiation
The U.S._Department_of_Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS) recognizes irradiation as an important technology to protect_consumers.
Fresh meat and poultry including whole or cut up birds, skinless poultry, pork
chops, roasts, stew_meat, liver, hamburgers, ground_meat, and ground poultry
are approved for irradiation.[9]
**** Assassination[edit] ****
Some claim that Gheorghe_Gheorghiu-Dej, who died of lung cancer in Bucharest on
March 19, 1965, was intentionally irradiated during a visit to Moscow, due to
his political stance.[10]
In 1999, an article in Der_Spiegel alleged that the East German MfS
intentionally irradiated political prisoners with high-dose radiation, possibly
to provoke cancer.[11][12]
Alexander_Litvinenko, a secret serviceman who was tackling organized crime in
Russia, was intentionally poisoned with Po-210; the very large internal doses
of radiation he received caused his death.
