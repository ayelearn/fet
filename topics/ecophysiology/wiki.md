The study of adaptation of an organism's physiology to environmental conditions
Ecophysiology (from Greek Î¿á¼¶ÎºÎ¿Ï, oikos, "house(hold)"; ÏÏÏÎ¹Ï,
physis, "nature, origin"; and -Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±, -logia), environmental physiology or
physiological ecology is a biological discipline that studies the adaptation of
an organism's physiology to environmental conditions. It is closely related to
comparative_physiology and evolutionary_physiology. Ernst_Haeckel's coinage
bionomy is sometimes employed as a synonym.[1]

***** Plants[edit] *****
Further information: Plant_perception_(physiology) and Plant_stress_measurement
Plant ecophysiology is concerned largely with two topics: mechanisms (how
plants sense and respond to environmental change) and scaling or integration
(how the responses to highly variable conditionsâfor example, gradients from
full sunlight to 95% shade within tree canopiesâare coordinated with one
another), and how their collective effect on plant growth and gas exchange can
be understood on this basis.
In many cases, animals are able to escape unfavourable and changing
environmental factors such as heat, cold, drought or floods, while plants are
unable to move away and therefore must endure the adverse conditions or perish
(animals go places, plants grow places). Plants are therefore phenotypically
plastic and have an impressive array of genes that aid in adapting to changing
conditions. It is hypothesized that this large number of genes can be partly
explained by plant species' need to adapt to a wider range of conditions.
**** Food[edit] ****

As with most abiotic factors, light intensity (irradiance) can be both
suboptimal and excessive. Light intensity is also an important component in
determining the temperature of plant organs (energy budget).The light response
curve of net photosynthesis (PI_curve) is particularly useful in characterising
a plant's tolerance to different light intensities.
Suboptimal light (shade) typically occurs at the base of a plant canopy or in
an understory environment. Shade_tolerant plants have a range of adaptations to
help them survive the altered quantity and quality of light typical of shade
environments.
Excess light occurs at the top of canopies and on open ground when cloud cover
is low and the sun's zenith angle is low, typically this occurs in the tropics
and at high altitudes. Excess light incident on a leaf can result in
photoinhibition and photodestruction. Plants adapted to high light environments
have a range of adaptations to avoid or dissipate the excess light energy, as
well as mechanisms that reduce the amount of injury caused.
**** Temperature[edit] ****
See also: Plant_adaptations_to_wildfires
In response to extremes of temperature, plants can produce various proteins.
These protect them from the damaging effects of ice formation and falling rates
of enzyme catalysis at low temperatures, and from enzyme denaturation and
increased photorespiration at high temperatures. As temperatures fall,
production of antifreeze_proteins and dehydrins increases. As temperatures
rise, production of heat_shock_proteins increases. Metabolic imbalances
associated with temperature extremes result in the build-up of reactive_oxygen
species, which can be countered by antioxidant systems. Cell_membranes are also
affected by changes in temperature and can cause the membrane to lose its fluid
properties and become a gel in cold conditions or to become leaky in hot
conditions. This can affect the movement of compounds across the membrane. To
prevent these changes, plants can change the composition of their membranes. In
cold conditions, more unsaturated_fatty_acids are placed in the membrane and in
hot conditions more saturated fatty acids are inserted.

Plants can avoid overheating by minimising the amount of sunlight absorbed and
by enhancing the cooling effects of wind and transpiration. Plants can reduce
light absorption using reflective leaf hairs, scales, and waxes. These features
are so common in warm dry regions that these habitats can be seen to form a
âsilvery landscapeâ as the light scatters off the canopies.[2] Some
species, such as Macroptilium purpureum, can move their leaves throughout the
day so that they are always orientated to avoid the sun (paraheliotropism).[3]
Knowledge of these mechanisms has been key to breeding_for_heat_stress
tolerance in agricultural plants.
Plants can avoid the full impact of low temperature by altering their
microclimate. For example, Raoulia plants found in the uplands of New Zealand
are said to resemble âvegetable sheepâ as they form tight cushion-like
clumps to insulate the most vulnerable plant parts and shield them from cooling
winds. The same principle has been applied in agriculture by using plastic
mulch to insulate the growing points of crops in cool climates in order to
boost plant growth.[4]
**** Water[edit] ****
See also: Moisture_stress
Too much or too little water can damage plants. If there is too little water
then tissues will dehydrate and the plant may die. If the soil becomes
waterlogged then the soil will become anoxic (low in oxygen), which can kill
the roots of the plant.
The ability of plants to access water depends on the structure of their roots
and on the water_potential of the root cells. When soil water content is low,
plants can alter their water potential to maintain a flow of water into the
roots and up to the leaves (Soil_plant_atmosphere_continuum). This remarkable
mechanism allows plants to lift water as high as 120 m by harnessing the
gradient created by transpiration from the leaves.[5]
In very dry soil, plants close their stomata to reduce transpiration and
prevent water loss. The closing of the stomata is often mediated by chemical
signals from the root (i.e., abscisic_acid). In irrigated fields, the fact that
plants close their stomata in response to drying of the roots can be exploited
to âtrickâ plants into using less water without reducing yields (see
partial_rootzone_drying). The use of this technique was largely developed by Dr
Peter Dry and colleagues in Australia[6][7] (see nominative_determinism).
If drought continues, the plant tissues will dehydrate, resulting in a loss of
turgor_pressure that is visible as wilting. As well as closing their stomata,
most plants can also respond to drought by altering their water potential
(osmotic_adjustment) and increasing root growth. Plants that are adapted to dry
environments (Xerophytes) have a range of more specialized mechanisms to
maintain water and/or protect tissues when desiccation occurs.
Waterlogging reduces the supply of oxygen to the roots and can kill a plant
within days. Plants cannot avoid waterlogging, but many species overcome the
lack of oxygen in the soil by transporting oxygen to the root from tissues that
are not submerged. Species that are tolerant of waterlogging develop
specialised roots near the soil surface and aerenchyma to allow the diffusion
of oxygen from the shoot to the root. Roots that are not killed outright may
also switch to less oxygen-hungry forms of cellular respiration.[8] Species
that are frequently submerged have evolved more elaborate mechanisms that
maintain root oxygen levels, such as the aerial roots seen in mangrove forests.
[9]
However, for many terminally overwatered houseplants, the initial symptoms of
waterlogging can resemble those due to drought. This is particularly true for
flood-sensitive plants that show drooping of their leaves due to epinasty
(rather than wilting).
**** CO
2 concentration[edit] ****
CO
2 is vital for plant growth, as it is the substrate for photosynthesis. Plants
take in CO
2 through stomatal pores on their leaves. At the same time as CO
2 enters the stomata, moisture escapes. This trade-off between CO
2 gain and water loss is central to plant productivity. The trade-off is all
the more critical as Rubisco, the enzyme used to capture CO
2, is efficient only when there is a high concentration of CO
2 in the leaf. Some plants overcome this difficulty by concentrating CO
2 within their leaves using C4_carbon_fixation or Crassulacean_acid_metabolism.
However, most species used C3_carbon_fixation and must open their stomata to
take in CO
2 whenever photosynthesis is taking place.

Plant Productivity in a Warming World
The concentration of CO
2_in_the_atmosphere is rising due to deforestation and the combustion of fossil
fuels. This would be expected to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis and
possibly increase the overall rate of plant growth. This possibility has
attracted considerable interest in recent years, as an increased rate of plant
growth could absorb some of the excess CO
2 and reduce the rate of global_warming. Extensive experiments growing plants
under elevated CO
2 using Free-Air_Concentration_Enrichment have shown that photosynthetic
efficiency does indeed increase. Plant growth rates also increase, by an
average of 17% for above-ground tissue and 30% for below-ground tissue.[10][11]
However, detrimental impacts of global warming, such as increased instances of
heat and drought stress, mean that the overall effect is likely to be a
reduction in plant productivity.[12][13][14] Reduced plant productivity would
be expected to accelerate the rate of global warming. Overall, these
observations point to the importance of avoiding further increases in
atmospheric CO
2 rather than risking runaway_climate_change.
**** Wind[edit] ****
See also: wind_pollination and seed_dispersal
Wind has three very different effects on plants.[15]
    * It affects the exchanges of mass (water evaporation, CO
      2) and of energy (heat) between the plant and the atmosphere by renewing
      the air at the contact with the leaves (convection).
    * It is sensed as signal driving a wind-acclimation syndrome by the plant
      known as thigmomorphogenesis, leading to modified growth and development
      and eventually to wind hardening.
    * Its drag_force can damage the plant (leaf abrasion, wind ruptures in
      branches and stems and windthrows and toppling in trees and lodging in
      crops).[16]
*** Exchange of mass and energy[edit] ***
Wind influences the way leaves regulate moisture, heat, and carbon dioxide.
When no wind is present, a layer of still air builds up around each leaf. This
is known as the boundary_layer and in effect insulates the leaf from the
environment, providing an atmosphere rich in moisture and less prone to
convective heating or cooling. As wind speed increases, the leaf environment
becomes more closely linked to the surrounding environment. It may become
difficult for the plant to retain moisture as it is exposed to dry air. On the
other hand, a moderately high wind allows the plant to cool its leaves more
easily when exposed to full sunlight. Plants are not entirely passive in their
interaction with wind. Plants can make their leaves less vulnerable to changes
in wind speed, by coating their leaves in fine hairs (trichomes) to break up
the air flow and increase the boundary layer. In fact, leaf and canopy
dimensions are often finely controlled to manipulate the boundary layer
depending on the prevailing environmental conditions.[17]
*** Acclimation[edit] ***
Plants can sense the wind through the deformation of its tissues. This signal
leads to inhibits the elongation and stimulates the radial expansion of their
shoots, while increasing the development of their root system. This syndrome of
responses known as thigmomorphogenesis results in shorter, stockier plants with
strengthened stems, as well as to an improved anchorage.[18] It was once
believed that this occurs mostly in very windy areas. But it has been found
that it happens even in areas with moderate winds, so that wind-induced signal
were found to be a major ecological factor.[15][19]
Trees have a particularly well-developed capacity to reinforce their trunks
when exposed to wind.From the parctical size, this realisation prompted
arboriculturalists in the UK in the 1960s to move away from the practice of
staking young amenity_trees to offer artificial support.[20]
*** Wind damage[edit] ***
Wind can damage most of the organs of the plants. Leaf abrasion (due to the
rubbing of leaves and branches or to the effect of air-borne particle such as
sand) and leaf of branch breakage are rather common phenomena, that plants have
to accommodate. In the more extreme cases, plants can be mortally damaged or
uprooted by wind. This has been a major selective pressure acting over
terrestrial plants.[21] Nowadays, it is one of the major threatening for
agriculture and forestry even in temperate zones.[15] It is worse for
agriculture in hurricane-prone regions, such as the banana-growing Windward
Islands in the Caribbean.[22]
When this type of disturbance occurs in natural systems, the only solution is
to ensure that there is an adequate stock of seeds or seedlings to quickly take
the place of the mature plants that have been lost- although, in many cases a
successional stage will be needed before the ecosystem can be restored to its
former state.
***** Animals[edit] *****
**** Humans[edit] ****
The_environment can have major influences on human physiology. Environmental
effects on human physiology are numerous; one of the most carefully studied
effects is the alterations in thermoregulation in the body due to outside
stresses. This is necessary because in order for enzymes to function, blood to
flow, and for various body organs to operate, temperature must remain at
consistent, balanced levels.
*** Thermoregulation[edit] ***
To achieve this, the body alters three main things to achieve a constant,
normal body temperature:
    * Heat transfer to the epidermis
    * The rate of evaporation
    * The rate of heat production
The hypothalamus plays an important role in thermoregulation. It connects to
thermal receptors in the dermis, and detects changes in surrounding blood to
make decisions of whether to stimulate internal heat production, or to
stimulate evaporation.
There are two main types of stresses that can be experienced due to extreme
environmental temperatures: heat_stress and cold_stress.
Heat stress is physiologically combated in four ways: radiation, conduction,
convection, and evaporation. Cold stress is physiologically combated by
shivering, accumulation of body_fat, circulatory adaptations (that provide an
efficient transfer of heat to the epidermis), and increased blood flow to the
extremities.
There is one part of the body fully equipped to deal with cold stress. The
respiratory_system protects itself against damage by warming the incoming air
to 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit before it reaches the bronchi. This means that not
even the most frigid of temperatures can damage the respiratory tract.
In both types of temperature related stress, it is important to remain well-
hydrated. Hydration reduces cardiovascular strain, enhances the ability of
energy processes to occur, and reduces feelings of exhaustion.
*** Altitude[edit] ***
Extreme temperatures are not the only obstacles that humans face. High
altitudes also pose serious physiological challenges on the body. Some of these
effects are reduced arterial______P_____O____2_______{\displaystyle_P_{{\mathrm
{O}_}_{2}}}__[P_{{\mathrm{O}}_2}], the rebalancing of the acid-base_content_in
body_fluids, increased hemoglobin, increased RBC synthesis, enhanced
circulation, and increased levels of the glycolysis byproduct 2,3
diphosphoglycerate, which promotes off-loading of O2 by hemoglobin in the
hypoxic_tissues.
Environmental factors can play a huge role in the human body's fight for
homeostasis. However, humans have found ways to adapt, both physiologically and
tangibly.
**** Scientists[edit] ****
George_A._Bartholomew (1919â2006) was a founder of animal physiological
ecology. He served on the faculty at UCLA from 1947 to 1989, and almost 1,200
individuals can trace their academic lineages to him.[23] Knut_Schmidt-Nielsen
(1915â2007) was also an important contributor to this specific scientific
field as well as comparative_physiology.
Hermann_Rahn (1912â1990) was an early leader in the field of environmental
physiology. Starting out in the field of zoology with a PhD from University_of
Rochester (1933), Rahn began teaching physiology at the University_of_Rochester
in 1941. It is there that he partnered with Wallace_O._Fenn to publish A
Graphical Analysis of the Respiratory Gas Exchange in 1955. This paper included
the landmark O2-CO2 diagram, which formed basis for much of Rahn's future work.
Rahn's research into applications of this diagram led to the development of
aerospace medicine and advancements in hyperbaric breathing and high-altitude
respiration. Rahn later joined the University_at_Buffalo in 1956 as the
Lawrence D. Bell Professor and Chairman of the Department of Physiology. As
Chairman, Rahn surrounded himself with outstanding faculty and made the
University an international research center in environmental physiology.
