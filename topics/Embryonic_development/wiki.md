Embryonic development also embryogenesis is the process by which the embryo
forms and develops. In mammals, the term refers chiefly to early stages of
prenatal_development, whereas the terms fetus and fetal_development describe
later stages.
Embryonic development starts with the fertilization of the egg_cell (ovum) by a
sperm cell, (spermatozoon). Once fertilized, the ovum is referred to as a
zygote, a single diploid cell. The zygote undergoes mitotic divisions with no
significant growth (a process known as cleavage) and cellular_differentiation,
leading to development of a multicellular embryo.
Although embryogenesis occurs in both animal and plant_development, this
article addresses the common features among different animals, with some
emphasis on the embryonic development of vertebrates and mammals.

***** Fertilization and the zygote[edit] *****
Main article: Zygote
The egg cell is generally asymmetric, having an "animal_pole" (future ectoderm
and mesoderm) and a "vegetal_pole" (future endoderm). It is covered with
protective envelopes, with different layers. The first envelope â the one in
contact with the membrane of the egg â is made of glycoproteins and is known
as the vitelline_membrane (zona_pellucida in mammals). Different taxa show
different cellular and acellular envelopes englobing the vitelline membrane.
Fertilization (also known as 'conception', 'fecundation' and 'syngamy') is the
fusion of gametes to produce a new organism. In animals, the process involves a
sperm fusing with an ovum, which eventually leads to the development of an
embryo. Depending on the animal species, the process can occur within the body
of the female in internal fertilisation, or outside in the case of external
fertilisation. The fertilized egg cell is known as the zygote.
To prevent more than one sperm fertilizing the egg, polyspermy, fast block and
slow block to polyspermy are used. Fast block, the membrane potential rapidly
depolarizing and then returning to normal, happens immediately after an egg is
fertilized by a single sperm. Slow block begins the first few seconds after
fertilization and is when the release of calcium causes the cortical reaction,
various enzymes releasing from cortical granules in the eggs plasma membrane,
to expand and harden the outside membrane, preventing more sperm from entering.
[1]
***** Cleavage and morula[edit] *****
Further information: Cleavage_(embryo)
Cell divisions (cleavage)
Cell division with no significant growth, producing a cluster of cells that is
the same size as the original zygote, is called cleavage. At least four initial
cell divisions occur, resulting in a dense ball of at least sixteen cells
called the morula. The different cells derived from cleavage, up to the
blastula_stage, are called blastomeres. Depending mostly on the amount of yolk
in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total) or meroblastic (partial).
[2]
Holoblastic cleavage occurs in animals with little yolk in their eggs, such as
humans and other mammals who receive nourishment as embryos from the mother,
via the placenta or milk, such as might be secreted from a marsupium. On the
other hand, meroblastic cleavage occurs in animals whose eggs have more yolk
(i.e. birds and reptiles). Because cleavage is impeded in the vegetal_pole,
there is an uneven distribution and size of cells, being more numerous and
smaller at the animal pole of the zygote.[2]
In holoblastic eggs the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal
axis of the egg, and the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From
here the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to
different planes of cleavage, in various organisms:
 _______Cleavage_patterns_followed_by_holoblastic_and_meroblastic_eggs________
|Holoblastic__________________________|Meroblastic____________________________|
|    * Radial (sea_urchin, amphioxus) |    * Discoidal (fish, birds, reptiles)|

|____*_Rotational_(mammals,_nematodes)|_______________________________________|
The end of cleavage is known as midblastula_transition and coincides with the
onset of zygotic transcription.
In amniotes, the cells of the morula are at first closely aggregated, but soon
they become arranged into an outer or peripheral layer, the trophoblast, which
does not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper, and an inner_cell
mass, from which the embryo is developed. Fluid collects between the
trophoblast and the greater part of the inner cell-mass, and thus the morula is
converted into a vesicle, called the blastodermic_vesicle. The inner cell mass
remains in contact, however, with the trophoblast at one pole of the ovum; this
is named the embryonic_pole, since it indicates the location where the future
embryo will develop.[3]
***** Formation of the blastula[edit] *****
After the 7th cleavage has produced 128 cells, the embryo is called a blastula.
[2] The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the blastoderm)
surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel).[4]
Mammals at this stage form a structure called the blastocyst,[1] characterized
by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula. The
blastocyst must not be confused with the blastula; even though they are similar
in structure, their cells have different fates. In the mouse, primordial germ
cells arise from a layer of cells in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst (the
epiblast) as a result of extensive genome-wide reprogramming.[5] Reprogramming
involves global DNA_demethylation facilitated by the DNA base_excision_repair
pathway as well as chromatin reorganization, and results in cellular
totipotency.[6]
Before gastrulation, the cells of the trophoblast become differentiated into
two strata: The outer stratum forms a syncytium (i.e., a layer of protoplasm
studded with nuclei, but showing no evidence of subdivision into cells), termed
the syncytiotrophoblast, while the inner layer, the cytotrophoblast or "Layer
of Langhans", consists of well-defined cells. As already stated, the cells of
the trophoblast do not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper; they
form the ectoderm of the chorion and play an important part in the development
of the placenta. On the deep surface of the inner cell mass, a layer of
flattened cells, called the endoderm, is differentiated and quickly assumes the
form of a small sac, called the yolk_sac. Spaces appear between the remaining
cells of the mass and, by the enlargement and coalescence of these spaces, a
cavity called the amniotic_cavity is gradually developed. The floor of this
cavity is formed by the embryonic_disk, which is composed of a layer of
prismatic_cells, the embryonic ectoderm, derived from the inner cell mass and
lying in apposition with the endoderm.[3]
**** Formation of the germ layers[edit] ****
The embryonic_disk becomes oval and then pear-shaped, the wider end being
directed forward. Near the narrow, posterior end, an opaque streak, called the
primitive_streak, makes its appearance and extends along the middle of the disk
for about one-half of its length; at the anterior end of the streak there is a
knob-like thickening termed the primitive_node or knot, (known as Hensen's knot
in birds). A shallow groove, the primitive_groove, appears on the surface of
the streak, and the anterior end of this groove communicates by means of an
aperture, the blastopore, with the yolk_sac. The primitive streak is produced
by a thickening of the axial part of the ectoderm, the cells of which multiply,
grow downward, and blend with those of the subjacent endoderm. From the sides
of the primitive streak a third layer of cells, the mesoderm, extends laterally
between the ectoderm and endoderm; the caudal end of the primitive streak forms
the cloacal_membrane. The blastoderm now consists of three layers, named from
without inward: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; each has distinctive
characteristics and gives rise to certain tissues of the body. For many
mammals, it is sometime during formation of the germ layers that implantation
of the embryo in the uterus of the mother occurs.[3]
***** Formation of the gastrula[edit] *****
Main article: Gastrulation
During gastrulation cells migrate to the interior of the blastula, subsequently
forming two (in diploblastic animals) or three (triploblastic) germ_layers. The
embryo during this process is called a gastrula. The germ layers are referred
to as the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In diploblastic animals only the
ectoderm and the endoderm are present.[2]
    * Among different animals, different combinations of the following
      processes occur to place the cells in the interior of the embryo:
          o Epiboly â expansion of one cell sheet over other cells[2]
          o Ingression â migration of individual cells into the embryo (cells
            move with pseudopods)[3]
          o Invagination â infolding of cell sheet into embryo, forming the
            mouth, anus, and archenteron.[2]
          o Delamination â splitting or migration of one sheet into two
            sheets
          o Involution â inturning of cell sheet over the basal surface of an
            outer layer
          o Polar proliferation â Cells at the polar ends of the blastula/
            gastrula proliferate, mostly at the animal pole.
    * Other major changes during gastrulation:
          o Heavy RNA_transcription using embryonic genes; up to this point the
            RNAs used were maternal (stored in the unfertilized egg).
          o Cells start major differentiation processes, losing their
            totipotentiality.
In most animals, a blastopore is formed at the point where cells are entering
the embryo. Two major groups of animals can be distinguished according to the
blastopore's fate. In deuterostomes the anus forms from the blastopore, while
in protostomes it develops into the mouth. See Embryological_origins_of_the
mouth_and_anus for more information.
**** Formation of the early nervous system â neural groove, tube and
notochord[edit] ****
In front of the primitive streak, two longitudinal ridges, caused by a folding
up of the ectoderm, make their appearance, one on either side of the middle
line formed by the streak. These are named the neural_folds; they commence some
little distance behind the anterior end of the embryonic_disk, where they are
continuous with each other, and from there gradually extend backward, one on
either side of the anterior end of the primitive streak. Between these folds is
a shallow median groove, the neural_groove. The groove gradually deepens as the
neural folds become elevated, and ultimately the folds meet and coalesce in the
middle line and convert the groove into a closed tube, the neural_tube or
canal, the ectodermal wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system.
After the coalescence of the neural folds over the anterior end of the
primitive streak, the blastopore no longer opens on the surface but into the
closed canal of the neural tube, and thus a transitory communication, the
neurenteric_canal, is established between the neural tube and the primitive
digestive_tube. The coalescence of the neural folds occurs first in the region
of the hind_brain, and from there extends forward and backward; toward the end
of the third week, the front opening (anterior_neuropore) of the tube finally
closes at the anterior end of the future brain, and forms a recess that is in
contact, for a time, with the overlying ectoderm; the hinder part of the neural
groove presents for a time a rhomboidal_shape, and to this expanded portion the
term sinus_rhomboidalis has been applied. Before the neural groove is closed, a
ridge of ectodermal cells appears along the prominent margin of each neural
fold; this is termed the neural_crest or ganglion ridge, and from it the spinal
and cranial nerve_ganglia and the ganglia of the sympathetic_nervous_system are
developed.[7] By the upward growth of the mesoderm, the neural tube is
ultimately separated from the overlying ectoderm.[8]
Dissection of human embryo
The cephalic end of the neural groove exhibits several dilatations that, when
the tube is shut, assume the form of three vesicles; these constitute the three
primary cerebral_vesicles, and correspond, respectively, to the future 'fore-
brain' (prosencephalon), 'midbrain' (mesencephalon), and 'hind-brain'
(rhombencephalon) (Fig. 18). The walls of the vesicles are developed into the
nervous tissue and neuroglia of the brain, and their cavities are modified to
form its ventricles. The remainder of the tube forms the spinal_cord (medulla
spinalis); from its ectodermal wall the nervous and neuroglial elements of the
spinal cord are developed, while the cavity persists as the central_canal.[8]
**** Formation of the early septum[edit] ****
The extension of the mesoderm takes place throughout the whole of the embryonic
and extra-embryonic areas of the ovum, except in certain regions. One of these
is seen immediately in front of the neural tube. Here the mesoderm extends
forward in the form of two crescentic_masses, which meet in the middle line so
as to enclose behind them an area that is devoid of mesoderm. Over this area,
the ectoderm and endoderm come into direct contact with each other and
constitute a thin membrane, the buccopharyngeal_membrane, which forms a septum
between the primitive mouth and pharynx.[3]
**** Early formation of the heart and other primitive structures[edit] ****
In front of the buccopharyngeal area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm
fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this
region is therefore designated the pericardial area. A second region where the
mesoderm is absent, at least for a time, is that immediately in front of the
pericardial area. This is termed the proamniotic_area, and is the region where
the proamnion is developed; in humans, however, it appears that a proamnion is
never formed. A third region is at the hind end of the embryo, where the
ectoderm and endoderm come into apposition and form the cloacal membrane.[3]
***** Somitogenesis[edit] *****
Main article: Somitogenesis
Somitogenesis is the process by which somites (primitive segments) are
produced. These segmented tissue blocks differentiate into skeletal muscle,
vertebrae, and dermis of all vertebrates.
Somitogenesis begins with the formation of somitomeres (whorls of concentric
mesoderm) marking the future somites in the presomitic mesoderm (unsegmented
paraxial). The presomitic mesoderm gives rise to successive pairs of somites,
identical in appearance that differentiate into the same cell types but the
structures formed by the cells vary depending upon the anteroposterior (e.g.,
the thoracic vertebrae have ribs, the lumbar vertebrae do not). Somites have
unique positional values along this axis and it is thought that these are
specified by the Hox homeotic_genes.
Toward the end of the second week after fertilization, transverse segmentation
of the paraxial_mesoderm begins, and it is converted into a series of well-
defined, more or less cubical masses, also known as the somites, which occupy
the entire length of the trunk on either side of the middle line from the
occipital region of the head. Each segment contains a central cavity (known as
a myocoel), which, however, is soon filled with angular and spindle-shape
cells. The somites lie immediately under the ectoderm on the lateral aspect of
the neural tube and notochord, and are connected to the lateral_mesoderm by the
intermediate_cell_mass. Those of the trunk may be arranged in the following
groups, viz.: cervical 8, thoracic 12, lumbar 5, sacral 5, and coccygeal from 5
to 8. Those of the occipital region of the head are usually described as being
four in number. In mammals, somites of the head can be recognized only in the
occipital region, but a study of the lower vertebrates leads to the belief that
they are present also in the anterior part of the head and that, altogether,
nine segments are represented in the cephalic region.[9]
***** Organogenesis[edit] *****
Main article: Organogenesis
Human embryo, 8-9 weeks, 38 mm
At some point after the different germ layers are defined, organogenesis
begins. The first stage in vertebrates is called neurulation, where the neural
plate folds forming the neural tube (see above).[2] Other common organs or
structures that arise at this time include the heart and somites (also above),
but from now on embryogenesis follows no common pattern among the different
taxa of the animal_kingdom.
In most animals organogenesis, along with morphogenesis, results in a larva.
The hatching of the larva, which must then undergo metamorphosis, marks the end
of embryonic development.

Embryonic development also embryogenesis is the process by which the embryo
forms and develops. In mammals, the term refers chiefly to early stages of
prenatal_development, whereas the terms fetus and fetal_development describe
later stages.
Embryonic development starts with the fertilization of the egg_cell (ovum) by a
sperm cell, (spermatozoon). Once fertilized, the ovum is referred to as a
zygote, a single diploid cell. The zygote undergoes mitotic divisions with no
significant growth (a process known as cleavage) and cellular_differentiation,
leading to development of a multicellular embryo.
Although embryogenesis occurs in both animal and plant_development, this
article addresses the common features among different animals, with some
emphasis on the embryonic development of vertebrates and mammals.

***** Fertilization and the zygote[edit] *****
Main article: Zygote
The egg cell is generally asymmetric, having an "animal_pole" (future ectoderm
and mesoderm) and a "vegetal_pole" (future endoderm). It is covered with
protective envelopes, with different layers. The first envelope â the one in
contact with the membrane of the egg â is made of glycoproteins and is known
as the vitelline_membrane (zona_pellucida in mammals). Different taxa show
different cellular and acellular envelopes englobing the vitelline membrane.
Fertilization (also known as 'conception', 'fecundation' and 'syngamy') is the
fusion of gametes to produce a new organism. In animals, the process involves a
sperm fusing with an ovum, which eventually leads to the development of an
embryo. Depending on the animal species, the process can occur within the body
of the female in internal fertilisation, or outside in the case of external
fertilisation. The fertilized egg cell is known as the zygote.
To prevent more than one sperm fertilizing the egg, polyspermy, fast block and
slow block to polyspermy are used. Fast block, the membrane potential rapidly
depolarizing and then returning to normal, happens immediately after an egg is
fertilized by a single sperm. Slow block begins the first few seconds after
fertilization and is when the release of calcium causes the cortical reaction,
various enzymes releasing from cortical granules in the eggs plasma membrane,
to expand and harden the outside membrane, preventing more sperm from entering.
[1]
***** Cleavage and morula[edit] *****
Further information: Cleavage_(embryo)
Cell divisions (cleavage)
Cell division with no significant growth, producing a cluster of cells that is
the same size as the original zygote, is called cleavage. At least four initial
cell divisions occur, resulting in a dense ball of at least sixteen cells
called the morula. The different cells derived from cleavage, up to the
blastula_stage, are called blastomeres. Depending mostly on the amount of yolk
in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total) or meroblastic (partial).
[2]
Holoblastic cleavage occurs in animals with little yolk in their eggs, such as
humans and other mammals who receive nourishment as embryos from the mother,
via the placenta or milk, such as might be secreted from a marsupium. On the
other hand, meroblastic cleavage occurs in animals whose eggs have more yolk
(i.e. birds and reptiles). Because cleavage is impeded in the vegetal_pole,
there is an uneven distribution and size of cells, being more numerous and
smaller at the animal pole of the zygote.[2]
In holoblastic eggs the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal
axis of the egg, and the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From
here the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to
different planes of cleavage, in various organisms:
 _______Cleavage_patterns_followed_by_holoblastic_and_meroblastic_eggs________
|Holoblastic__________________________|Meroblastic____________________________|
|    * Radial (sea_urchin, amphioxus) |    * Discoidal (fish, birds, reptiles)|
|    * Bilateral (tunicates,          |    * Superficial (insects)            |
|      amphibians)                    |                                       |
|    * Spiral (annelids, mollusks)    |                                       |
|____*_Rotational_(mammals,_nematodes)|_______________________________________|
The end of cleavage is known as midblastula_transition and coincides with the
onset of zygotic transcription.
In amniotes, the cells of the morula are at first closely aggregated, but soon
they become arranged into an outer or peripheral layer, the trophoblast, which
does not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper, and an inner_cell
mass, from which the embryo is developed. Fluid collects between the
trophoblast and the greater part of the inner cell-mass, and thus the morula is
converted into a vesicle, called the blastodermic_vesicle. The inner cell mass
remains in contact, however, with the trophoblast at one pole of the ovum; this
is named the embryonic_pole, since it indicates the location where the future
embryo will develop.[3]
***** Formation of the blastula[edit] *****
After the 7th cleavage has produced 128 cells, the embryo is called a blastula.
[2] The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the blastoderm)
surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel).[4]
Mammals at this stage form a structure called the blastocyst,[1] characterized
by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula. The
blastocyst must not be confused with the blastula; even though they are similar
in structure, their cells have different fates. In the mouse, primordial germ
cells arise from a layer of cells in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst (the
epiblast) as a result of extensive genome-wide reprogramming.[5] Reprogramming
involves global DNA_demethylation facilitated by the DNA base_excision_repair
pathway as well as chromatin reorganization, and results in cellular
totipotency.[6]
Before gastrulation, the cells of the trophoblast become differentiated into
two strata: The outer stratum forms a syncytium (i.e., a layer of protoplasm
studded with nuclei, but showing no evidence of subdivision into cells), termed
the syncytiotrophoblast, while the inner layer, the cytotrophoblast or "Layer
of Langhans", consists of well-defined cells. As already stated, the cells of
the trophoblast do not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper; they
form the ectoderm of the chorion and play an important part in the development
of the placenta. On the deep surface of the inner cell mass, a layer of
flattened cells, called the endoderm, is differentiated and quickly assumes the
form of a small sac, called the yolk_sac. Spaces appear between the remaining
cells of the mass and, by the enlargement and coalescence of these spaces, a
cavity called the amniotic_cavity is gradually developed. The floor of this
cavity is formed by the embryonic_disk, which is composed of a layer of
prismatic_cells, the embryonic ectoderm, derived from the inner cell mass and
lying in apposition with the endoderm.[3]
**** Formation of the germ layers[edit] ****
The embryonic_disk becomes oval and then pear-shaped, the wider end being
directed forward. Near the narrow, posterior end, an opaque streak, called the
primitive_streak, makes its appearance and extends along the middle of the disk
for about one-half of its length; at the anterior end of the streak there is a
knob-like thickening termed the primitive_node or knot, (known as Hensen's knot
in birds). A shallow groove, the primitive_groove, appears on the surface of
the streak, and the anterior end of this groove communicates by means of an
aperture, the blastopore, with the yolk_sac. The primitive streak is produced
by a thickening of the axial part of the ectoderm, the cells of which multiply,
grow downward, and blend with those of the subjacent endoderm. From the sides
of the primitive streak a third layer of cells, the mesoderm, extends laterally
between the ectoderm and endoderm; the caudal end of the primitive streak forms
the cloacal_membrane. The blastoderm now consists of three layers, named from
without inward: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; each has distinctive
characteristics and gives rise to certain tissues of the body. For many
mammals, it is sometime during formation of the germ layers that implantation
of the embryo in the uterus of the mother occurs.[3]
***** Formation of the gastrula[edit] *****
Main article: Gastrulation
During gastrulation cells migrate to the interior of the blastula, subsequently
forming two (in diploblastic animals) or three (triploblastic) germ_layers. The
embryo during this process is called a gastrula. The germ layers are referred
to as the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In diploblastic animals only the
ectoderm and the endoderm are present.[2]
    * Among different animals, different combinations of the following
      processes occur to place the cells in the interior of the embryo:
          o Epiboly â expansion of one cell sheet over other cells[2]
          o Ingression â migration of individual cells into the embryo (cells
            move with pseudopods)[3]
          o Invagination â infolding of cell sheet into embryo, forming the
            mouth, anus, and archenteron.[2]
          o Delamination â splitting or migration of one sheet into two
            sheets
          o Involution â inturning of cell sheet over the basal surface of an
            outer layer
          o Polar proliferation â Cells at the polar ends of the blastula/
            gastrula proliferate, mostly at the animal pole.
    * Other major changes during gastrulation:
          o Heavy RNA_transcription using embryonic genes; up to this point the
            RNAs used were maternal (stored in the unfertilized egg).
          o Cells start major differentiation processes, losing their
            totipotentiality.
In most animals, a blastopore is formed at the point where cells are entering
the embryo. Two major groups of animals can be distinguished according to the
blastopore's fate. In deuterostomes the anus forms from the blastopore, while
in protostomes it develops into the mouth. See Embryological_origins_of_the
mouth_and_anus for more information.
**** Formation of the early nervous system â neural groove, tube and
notochord[edit] ****
In front of the primitive streak, two longitudinal ridges, caused by a folding
up of the ectoderm, make their appearance, one on either side of the middle
line formed by the streak. These are named the neural_folds; they commence some
little distance behind the anterior end of the embryonic_disk, where they are
continuous with each other, and from there gradually extend backward, one on
either side of the anterior end of the primitive streak. Between these folds is
a shallow median groove, the neural_groove. The groove gradually deepens as the
neural folds become elevated, and ultimately the folds meet and coalesce in the
middle line and convert the groove into a closed tube, the neural_tube or
canal, the ectodermal wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system.
After the coalescence of the neural folds over the anterior end of the
primitive streak, the blastopore no longer opens on the surface but into the
closed canal of the neural tube, and thus a transitory communication, the
neurenteric_canal, is established between the neural tube and the primitive
digestive_tube. The coalescence of the neural folds occurs first in the region
of the hind_brain, and from there extends forward and backward; toward the end
of the third week, the front opening (anterior_neuropore) of the tube finally
closes at the anterior end of the future brain, and forms a recess that is in
contact, for a time, with the overlying ectoderm; the hinder part of the neural
groove presents for a time a rhomboidal_shape, and to this expanded portion the
term sinus_rhomboidalis has been applied. Before the neural groove is closed, a
ridge of ectodermal cells appears along the prominent margin of each neural
fold; this is termed the neural_crest or ganglion ridge, and from it the spinal
and cranial nerve_ganglia and the ganglia of the sympathetic_nervous_system are
developed.[7] By the upward growth of the mesoderm, the neural tube is
ultimately separated from the overlying ectoderm.[8]
Dissection of human embryo
The cephalic end of the neural groove exhibits several dilatations that, when
the tube is shut, assume the form of three vesicles; these constitute the three
primary cerebral_vesicles, and correspond, respectively, to the future 'fore-
brain' (prosencephalon), 'midbrain' (mesencephalon), and 'hind-brain'
(rhombencephalon) (Fig. 18). The walls of the vesicles are developed into the
nervous tissue and neuroglia of the brain, and their cavities are modified to
form its ventricles. The remainder of the tube forms the spinal_cord (medulla
spinalis); from its ectodermal wall the nervous and neuroglial elements of the
spinal cord are developed, while the cavity persists as the central_canal.[8]
**** Formation of the early septum[edit] ****
The extension of the mesoderm takes place throughout the whole of the embryonic
and extra-embryonic areas of the ovum, except in certain regions. One of these
is seen immediately in front of the neural tube. Here the mesoderm extends
forward in the form of two crescentic_masses, which meet in the middle line so
as to enclose behind them an area that is devoid of mesoderm. Over this area,
the ectoderm and endoderm come into direct contact with each other and
constitute a thin membrane, the buccopharyngeal_membrane, which forms a septum
between the primitive mouth and pharynx.[3]
**** Early formation of the heart and other primitive structures[edit] ****
In front of the buccopharyngeal area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm
fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this
region is therefore designated the pericardial area. A second region where the
mesoderm is absent, at least for a time, is that immediately in front of the
pericardial area. This is termed the proamniotic_area, and is the region where
the proamnion is developed; in humans, however, it appears that a proamnion is
never formed. A third region is at the hind end of the embryo, where the
ectoderm and endoderm come into apposition and form the cloacal membrane.[3]
***** Somitogenesis[edit] *****
Main article: Somitogenesis
Somitogenesis is the process by which somites (primitive segments) are
produced. These segmented tissue blocks differentiate into skeletal muscle,
vertebrae, and dermis of all vertebrates.
Somitogenesis begins with the formation of somitomeres (whorls of concentric
mesoderm) marking the future somites in the presomitic mesoderm (unsegmented
paraxial). The presomitic mesoderm gives rise to successive pairs of somites,
identical in appearance that differentiate into the same cell types but the
structures formed by the cells vary depending upon the anteroposterior (e.g.,
the thoracic vertebrae have ribs, the lumbar vertebrae do not). Somites have
unique positional values along this axis and it is thought that these are
specified by the Hox homeotic_genes.
Toward the end of the second week after fertilization, transverse segmentation
of the paraxial_mesoderm begins, and it is converted into a series of well-
defined, more or less cubical masses, also known as the somites, which occupy
the entire length of the trunk on either side of the middle line from the
occipital region of the head. Each segment contains a central cavity (known as
a myocoel), which, however, is soon filled with angular and spindle-shape
cells. The somites lie immediately under the ectoderm on the lateral aspect of
the neural tube and notochord, and are connected to the lateral_mesoderm by the
intermediate_cell_mass. Those of the trunk may be arranged in the following
groups, viz.: cervical 8, thoracic 12, lumbar 5, sacral 5, and coccygeal from 5
to 8. Those of the occipital region of the head are usually described as being
four in number. In mammals, somites of the head can be recognized only in the
occipital region, but a study of the lower vertebrates leads to the belief that
they are present also in the anterior part of the head and that, altogether,
nine segments are represented in the cephalic region.[9]
***** Organogenesis[edit] *****
Main article: Organogenesis
Human embryo, 8-9 weeks, 38 mm
At some point after the different germ layers are defined, organogenesis
begins. The first stage in vertebrates is called neurulation, where the neural
plate folds forming the neural tube (see above).[2] Other common organs or
structures that arise at this time include the heart and somites (also above),
but from now on embryogenesis follows no common pattern among the different
taxa of the animal_kingdom.
In most animals organogenesis, along with morphogenesis, results in a larva.
The hatching of the larva, which must then undergo metamorphosis, marks the end
of embryonic development.

Embryonic development also embryogenesis is the process by which the embryo
forms and develops. In mammals, the term refers chiefly to early stages of
prenatal_development, whereas the terms fetus and fetal_development describe
later stages.
Embryonic development starts with the fertilization of the egg_cell (ovum) by a
sperm cell, (spermatozoon). Once fertilized, the ovum is referred to as a
zygote, a single diploid cell. The zygote undergoes mitotic divisions with no
significant growth (a process known as cleavage) and cellular_differentiation,
leading to development of a multicellular embryo.
Although embryogenesis occurs in both animal and plant_development, this
article addresses the common features among different animals, with some
emphasis on the embryonic development of vertebrates and mammals.

***** Fertilization and the zygote[edit] *****
Main article: Zygote
The egg cell is generally asymmetric, having an "animal_pole" (future ectoderm
and mesoderm) and a "vegetal_pole" (future endoderm). It is covered with
protective envelopes, with different layers. The first envelope â the one in
contact with the membrane of the egg â is made of glycoproteins and is known
as the vitelline_membrane (zona_pellucida in mammals). Different taxa show
different cellular and acellular envelopes englobing the vitelline membrane.
Fertilization (also known as 'conception', 'fecundation' and 'syngamy') is the
fusion of gametes to produce a new organism. In animals, the process involves a
sperm fusing with an ovum, which eventually leads to the development of an
embryo. Depending on the animal species, the process can occur within the body
of the female in internal fertilisation, or outside in the case of external
fertilisation. The fertilized egg cell is known as the zygote.
To prevent more than one sperm fertilizing the egg, polyspermy, fast block and
slow block to polyspermy are used. Fast block, the membrane potential rapidly
depolarizing and then returning to normal, happens immediately after an egg is
fertilized by a single sperm. Slow block begins the first few seconds after
fertilization and is when the release of calcium causes the cortical reaction,
various enzymes releasing from cortical granules in the eggs plasma membrane,
to expand and harden the outside membrane, preventing more sperm from entering.
[1]
***** Cleavage and morula[edit] *****
Further information: Cleavage_(embryo)
Cell divisions (cleavage)
Cell division with no significant growth, producing a cluster of cells that is
the same size as the original zygote, is called cleavage. At least four initial
cell divisions occur, resulting in a dense ball of at least sixteen cells
called the morula. The different cells derived from cleavage, up to the
blastula_stage, are called blastomeres. Depending mostly on the amount of yolk
in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total) or meroblastic (partial).
[2]
Holoblastic cleavage occurs in animals with little yolk in their eggs, such as
humans and other mammals who receive nourishment as embryos from the mother,
via the placenta or milk, such as might be secreted from a marsupium. On the
other hand, meroblastic cleavage occurs in animals whose eggs have more yolk
(i.e. birds and reptiles). Because cleavage is impeded in the vegetal_pole,
there is an uneven distribution and size of cells, being more numerous and
smaller at the animal pole of the zygote.[2]
In holoblastic eggs the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal
axis of the egg, and the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From
here the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to
different planes of cleavage, in various organisms:
 _______Cleavage_patterns_followed_by_holoblastic_and_meroblastic_eggs________
|Holoblastic__________________________|Meroblastic____________________________|
|    * Radial (sea_urchin, amphioxus) |    * Discoidal (fish, birds, reptiles)|
|    * Bilateral (tunicates,          |    * Superficial (insects)            |
|      amphibians)                    |                                       |
|    * Spiral (annelids, mollusks)    |                                       |
|____*_Rotational_(mammals,_nematodes)|_______________________________________|
The end of cleavage is known as midblastula_transition and coincides with the
onset of zygotic transcription.
In amniotes, the cells of the morula are at first closely aggregated, but soon
they become arranged into an outer or peripheral layer, the trophoblast, which
does not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper, and an inner_cell
mass, from which the embryo is developed. Fluid collects between the
trophoblast and the greater part of the inner cell-mass, and thus the morula is
converted into a vesicle, called the blastodermic_vesicle. The inner cell mass
remains in contact, however, with the trophoblast at one pole of the ovum; this
is named the embryonic_pole, since it indicates the location where the future
embryo will develop.[3]
***** Formation of the blastula[edit] *****
After the 7th cleavage has produced 128 cells, the embryo is called a blastula.
[2] The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the blastoderm)
surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel).[4]
Mammals at this stage form a structure called the blastocyst,[1] characterized
by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula. The
blastocyst must not be confused with the blastula; even though they are similar
in structure, their cells have different fates. In the mouse, primordial germ
cells arise from a layer of cells in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst (the
epiblast) as a result of extensive genome-wide reprogramming.[5] Reprogramming
involves global DNA_demethylation facilitated by the DNA base_excision_repair
pathway as well as chromatin reorganization, and results in cellular
totipotency.[6]
Before gastrulation, the cells of the trophoblast become differentiated into
two strata: The outer stratum forms a syncytium (i.e., a layer of protoplasm
studded with nuclei, but showing no evidence of subdivision into cells), termed
the syncytiotrophoblast, while the inner layer, the cytotrophoblast or "Layer
of Langhans", consists of well-defined cells. As already stated, the cells of
the trophoblast do not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper; they
form the ectoderm of the chorion and play an important part in the development
of the placenta. On the deep surface of the inner cell mass, a layer of
flattened cells, called the endoderm, is differentiated and quickly assumes the
form of a small sac, called the yolk_sac. Spaces appear between the remaining
cells of the mass and, by the enlargement and coalescence of these spaces, a
cavity called the amniotic_cavity is gradually developed. The floor of this
cavity is formed by the embryonic_disk, which is composed of a layer of
prismatic_cells, the embryonic ectoderm, derived from the inner cell mass and
lying in apposition with the endoderm.[3]
**** Formation of the germ layers[edit] ****
The embryonic_disk becomes oval and then pear-shaped, the wider end being
directed forward. Near the narrow, posterior end, an opaque streak, called the
primitive_streak, makes its appearance and extends along the middle of the disk
for about one-half of its length; at the anterior end of the streak there is a
knob-like thickening termed the primitive_node or knot, (known as Hensen's knot
in birds). A shallow groove, the primitive_groove, appears on the surface of
the streak, and the anterior end of this groove communicates by means of an
aperture, the blastopore, with the yolk_sac. The primitive streak is produced
by a thickening of the axial part of the ectoderm, the cells of which multiply,
grow downward, and blend with those of the subjacent endoderm. From the sides
of the primitive streak a third layer of cells, the mesoderm, extends laterally
between the ectoderm and endoderm; the caudal end of the primitive streak forms
the cloacal_membrane. The blastoderm now consists of three layers, named from
without inward: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; each has distinctive
characteristics and gives rise to certain tissues of the body. For many
mammals, it is sometime during formation of the germ layers that implantation
of the embryo in the uterus of the mother occurs.[3]
***** Formation of the gastrula[edit] *****
Main article: Gastrulation
During gastrulation cells migrate to the interior of the blastula, subsequently
forming two (in diploblastic animals) or three (triploblastic) germ_layers. The
embryo during this process is called a gastrula. The germ layers are referred
to as the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In diploblastic animals only the
ectoderm and the endoderm are present.[2]
    * Among different animals, different combinations of the following
      processes occur to place the cells in the interior of the embryo:
          o Epiboly â expansion of one cell sheet over other cells[2]
          o Ingression â migration of individual cells into the embryo (cells
            move with pseudopods)[3]
          o Invagination â infolding of cell sheet into embryo, forming the
            mouth, anus, and archenteron.[2]
          o Delamination â splitting or migration of one sheet into two
            sheets
          o Involution â inturning of cell sheet over the basal surface of an
            outer layer
          o Polar proliferation â Cells at the polar ends of the blastula/
            gastrula proliferate, mostly at the animal pole.
    * Other major changes during gastrulation:
          o Heavy RNA_transcription using embryonic genes; up to this point the
            RNAs used were maternal (stored in the unfertilized egg).
          o Cells start major differentiation processes, losing their
            totipotentiality.
In most animals, a blastopore is formed at the point where cells are entering
the embryo. Two major groups of animals can be distinguished according to the
blastopore's fate. In deuterostomes the anus forms from the blastopore, while
in protostomes it develops into the mouth. See Embryological_origins_of_the
mouth_and_anus for more information.
**** Formation of the early nervous system â neural groove, tube and
notochord[edit] ****
In front of the primitive streak, two longitudinal ridges, caused by a folding
up of the ectoderm, make their appearance, one on either side of the middle
line formed by the streak. These are named the neural_folds; they commence some
little distance behind the anterior end of the embryonic_disk, where they are
continuous with each other, and from there gradually extend backward, one on
either side of the anterior end of the primitive streak. Between these folds is
a shallow median groove, the neural_groove. The groove gradually deepens as the
neural folds become elevated, and ultimately the folds meet and coalesce in the
middle line and convert the groove into a closed tube, the neural_tube or
canal, the ectodermal wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system.
After the coalescence of the neural folds over the anterior end of the
primitive streak, the blastopore no longer opens on the surface but into the
closed canal of the neural tube, and thus a transitory communication, the
neurenteric_canal, is established between the neural tube and the primitive
digestive_tube. The coalescence of the neural folds occurs first in the region
of the hind_brain, and from there extends forward and backward; toward the end
of the third week, the front opening (anterior_neuropore) of the tube finally
closes at the anterior end of the future brain, and forms a recess that is in
contact, for a time, with the overlying ectoderm; the hinder part of the neural
groove presents for a time a rhomboidal_shape, and to this expanded portion the
term sinus_rhomboidalis has been applied. Before the neural groove is closed, a
ridge of ectodermal cells appears along the prominent margin of each neural
fold; this is termed the neural_crest or ganglion ridge, and from it the spinal
and cranial nerve_ganglia and the ganglia of the sympathetic_nervous_system are
developed.[7] By the upward growth of the mesoderm, the neural tube is
ultimately separated from the overlying ectoderm.[8]
Dissection of human embryo
The cephalic end of the neural groove exhibits several dilatations that, when
the tube is shut, assume the form of three vesicles; these constitute the three
primary cerebral_vesicles, and correspond, respectively, to the future 'fore-
brain' (prosencephalon), 'midbrain' (mesencephalon), and 'hind-brain'
(rhombencephalon) (Fig. 18). The walls of the vesicles are developed into the
nervous tissue and neuroglia of the brain, and their cavities are modified to
form its ventricles. The remainder of the tube forms the spinal_cord (medulla
spinalis); from its ectodermal wall the nervous and neuroglial elements of the
spinal cord are developed, while the cavity persists as the central_canal.[8]
**** Formation of the early septum[edit] ****
The extension of the mesoderm takes place throughout the whole of the embryonic
and extra-embryonic areas of the ovum, except in certain regions. One of these
is seen immediately in front of the neural tube. Here the mesoderm extends
forward in the form of two crescentic_masses, which meet in the middle line so
as to enclose behind them an area that is devoid of mesoderm. Over this area,
the ectoderm and endoderm come into direct contact with each other and
constitute a thin membrane, the buccopharyngeal_membrane, which forms a septum
between the primitive mouth and pharynx.[3]
**** Early formation of the heart and other primitive structures[edit] ****
In front of the buccopharyngeal area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm
fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this
region is therefore designated the pericardial area. A second region where the
mesoderm is absent, at least for a time, is that immediately in front of the
pericardial area. This is termed the proamniotic_area, and is the region where
the proamnion is developed; in humans, however, it appears that a proamnion is
never formed. A third region is at the hind end of the embryo, where the
ectoderm and endoderm come into apposition and form the cloacal membrane.[3]
***** Somitogenesis[edit] *****
Main article: Somitogenesis
Somitogenesis is the process by which somites (primitive segments) are
produced. These segmented tissue blocks differentiate into skeletal muscle,
vertebrae, and dermis of all vertebrates.
Somitogenesis begins with the formation of somitomeres (whorls of concentric
mesoderm) marking the future somites in the presomitic mesoderm (unsegmented
paraxial). The presomitic mesoderm gives rise to successive pairs of somites,
identical in appearance that differentiate into the same cell types but the
structures formed by the cells vary depending upon the anteroposterior (e.g.,
the thoracic vertebrae have ribs, the lumbar vertebrae do not). Somites have
unique positional values along this axis and it is thought that these are
specified by the Hox homeotic_genes.
Toward the end of the second week after fertilization, transverse segmentation
of the paraxial_mesoderm begins, and it is converted into a series of well-
defined, more or less cubical masses, also known as the somites, which occupy
the entire length of the trunk on either side of the middle line from the
occipital region of the head. Each segment contains a central cavity (known as
a myocoel), which, however, is soon filled with angular and spindle-shape
cells. The somites lie immediately under the ectoderm on the lateral aspect of
the neural tube and notochord, and are connected to the lateral_mesoderm by the
intermediate_cell_mass. Those of the trunk may be arranged in the following
groups, viz.: cervical 8, thoracic 12, lumbar 5, sacral 5, and coccygeal from 5
to 8. Those of the occipital region of the head are usually described as being
four in number. In mammals, somites of the head can be recognized only in the
occipital region, but a study of the lower vertebrates leads to the belief that
they are present also in the anterior part of the head and that, altogether,
nine segments are represented in the cephalic region.[9]
***** Organogenesis[edit] *****
Main article: Organogenesis
Human embryo, 8-9 weeks, 38 mm
At some point after the different germ layers are defined, organogenesis
begins. The first stage in vertebrates is called neurulation, where the neural
plate folds forming the neural tube (see above).[2] Other common organs or
structures that arise at this time include the heart and somites (also above),
but from now on embryogenesis follows no common pattern among the different
taxa of the animal_kingdom.
In most animals organogenesis, along with morphogenesis, results in a larva.
The hatching of the larva, which must then undergo metamorphosis, marks the end
of embryonic development.

Embryonic development also embryogenesis is the process by which the embryo
forms and develops. In mammals, the term refers chiefly to early stages of
prenatal_development, whereas the terms fetus and fetal_development describe
later stages.
Embryonic development starts with the fertilization of the egg_cell (ovum) by a
sperm cell, (spermatozoon). Once fertilized, the ovum is referred to as a
zygote, a single diploid cell. The zygote undergoes mitotic divisions with no
significant growth (a process known as cleavage) and cellular_differentiation,
leading to development of a multicellular embryo.
Although embryogenesis occurs in both animal and plant_development, this
article addresses the common features among different animals, with some
emphasis on the embryonic development of vertebrates and mammals.

***** Fertilization and the zygote[edit] *****
Main article: Zygote
The egg cell is generally asymmetric, having an "animal_pole" (future ectoderm
and mesoderm) and a "vegetal_pole" (future endoderm). It is covered with
protective envelopes, with different layers. The first envelope â the one in
contact with the membrane of the egg â is made of glycoproteins and is known
as the vitelline_membrane (zona_pellucida in mammals). Different taxa show
different cellular and acellular envelopes englobing the vitelline membrane.
Fertilization (also known as 'conception', 'fecundation' and 'syngamy') is the
fusion of gametes to produce a new organism. In animals, the process involves a
sperm fusing with an ovum, which eventually leads to the development of an
embryo. Depending on the animal species, the process can occur within the body
of the female in internal fertilisation, or outside in the case of external
fertilisation. The fertilized egg cell is known as the zygote.
To prevent more than one sperm fertilizing the egg, polyspermy, fast block and
slow block to polyspermy are used. Fast block, the membrane potential rapidly
depolarizing and then returning to normal, happens immediately after an egg is
fertilized by a single sperm. Slow block begins the first few seconds after
fertilization and is when the release of calcium causes the cortical reaction,
various enzymes releasing from cortical granules in the eggs plasma membrane,
to expand and harden the outside membrane, preventing more sperm from entering.
[1]
***** Cleavage and morula[edit] *****
Further information: Cleavage_(embryo)
Cell divisions (cleavage)
Cell division with no significant growth, producing a cluster of cells that is
the same size as the original zygote, is called cleavage. At least four initial
cell divisions occur, resulting in a dense ball of at least sixteen cells
called the morula. The different cells derived from cleavage, up to the
blastula_stage, are called blastomeres. Depending mostly on the amount of yolk
in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total) or meroblastic (partial).
[2]
Holoblastic cleavage occurs in animals with little yolk in their eggs, such as
humans and other mammals who receive nourishment as embryos from the mother,
via the placenta or milk, such as might be secreted from a marsupium. On the
other hand, meroblastic cleavage occurs in animals whose eggs have more yolk
(i.e. birds and reptiles). Because cleavage is impeded in the vegetal_pole,
there is an uneven distribution and size of cells, being more numerous and
smaller at the animal pole of the zygote.[2]
In holoblastic eggs the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal
axis of the egg, and the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From
here the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to
different planes of cleavage, in various organisms:
 _______Cleavage_patterns_followed_by_holoblastic_and_meroblastic_eggs________
|Holoblastic__________________________|Meroblastic____________________________|
|    * Radial (sea_urchin, amphioxus) |    * Discoidal (fish, birds, reptiles)|
|    * Bilateral (tunicates,          |    * Superficial (insects)            |
|      amphibians)                    |                                       |
|    * Spiral (annelids, mollusks)    |                                       |
|____*_Rotational_(mammals,_nematodes)|_______________________________________|
The end of cleavage is known as midblastula_transition and coincides with the
onset of zygotic transcription.
In amniotes, the cells of the morula are at first closely aggregated, but soon
they become arranged into an outer or peripheral layer, the trophoblast, which
does not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper, and an inner_cell
mass, from which the embryo is developed. Fluid collects between the
trophoblast and the greater part of the inner cell-mass, and thus the morula is
converted into a vesicle, called the blastodermic_vesicle. The inner cell mass
remains in contact, however, with the trophoblast at one pole of the ovum; this
is named the embryonic_pole, since it indicates the location where the future
embryo will develop.[3]
***** Formation of the blastula[edit] *****
After the 7th cleavage has produced 128 cells, the embryo is called a blastula.
[2] The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the blastoderm)
surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel).[4]
Mammals at this stage form a structure called the blastocyst,[1] characterized
by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula. The
blastocyst must not be confused with the blastula; even though they are similar
in structure, their cells have different fates. In the mouse, primordial germ
cells arise from a layer of cells in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst (the
epiblast) as a result of extensive genome-wide reprogramming.[5] Reprogramming
involves global DNA_demethylation facilitated by the DNA base_excision_repair
pathway as well as chromatin reorganization, and results in cellular
totipotency.[6]
Before gastrulation, the cells of the trophoblast become differentiated into
two strata: The outer stratum forms a syncytium (i.e., a layer of protoplasm
studded with nuclei, but showing no evidence of subdivision into cells), termed
the syncytiotrophoblast, while the inner layer, the cytotrophoblast or "Layer
of Langhans", consists of well-defined cells. As already stated, the cells of
the trophoblast do not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper; they
form the ectoderm of the chorion and play an important part in the development
of the placenta. On the deep surface of the inner cell mass, a layer of
flattened cells, called the endoderm, is differentiated and quickly assumes the
form of a small sac, called the yolk_sac. Spaces appear between the remaining
cells of the mass and, by the enlargement and coalescence of these spaces, a
cavity called the amniotic_cavity is gradually developed. The floor of this
cavity is formed by the embryonic_disk, which is composed of a layer of
prismatic_cells, the embryonic ectoderm, derived from the inner cell mass and
lying in apposition with the endoderm.[3]
**** Formation of the germ layers[edit] ****
The embryonic_disk becomes oval and then pear-shaped, the wider end being
directed forward. Near the narrow, posterior end, an opaque streak, called the
primitive_streak, makes its appearance and extends along the middle of the disk
for about one-half of its length; at the anterior end of the streak there is a
knob-like thickening termed the primitive_node or knot, (known as Hensen's knot
in birds). A shallow groove, the primitive_groove, appears on the surface of
the streak, and the anterior end of this groove communicates by means of an
aperture, the blastopore, with the yolk_sac. The primitive streak is produced
by a thickening of the axial part of the ectoderm, the cells of which multiply,
grow downward, and blend with those of the subjacent endoderm. From the sides
of the primitive streak a third layer of cells, the mesoderm, extends laterally
between the ectoderm and endoderm; the caudal end of the primitive streak forms
the cloacal_membrane. The blastoderm now consists of three layers, named from
without inward: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; each has distinctive
characteristics and gives rise to certain tissues of the body. For many
mammals, it is sometime during formation of the germ layers that implantation
of the embryo in the uterus of the mother occurs.[3]
***** Formation of the gastrula[edit] *****
Main article: Gastrulation
During gastrulation cells migrate to the interior of the blastula, subsequently
forming two (in diploblastic animals) or three (triploblastic) germ_layers. The
embryo during this process is called a gastrula. The germ layers are referred
to as the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In diploblastic animals only the
ectoderm and the endoderm are present.[2]
    * Among different animals, different combinations of the following
      processes occur to place the cells in the interior of the embryo:
          o Epiboly â expansion of one cell sheet over other cells[2]
          o Ingression â migration of individual cells into the embryo (cells
            move with pseudopods)[3]
          o Invagination â infolding of cell sheet into embryo, forming the
            mouth, anus, and archenteron.[2]
          o Delamination â splitting or migration of one sheet into two
            sheets
          o Involution â inturning of cell sheet over the basal surface of an
            outer layer
          o Polar proliferation â Cells at the polar ends of the blastula/
            gastrula proliferate, mostly at the animal pole.
    * Other major changes during gastrulation:
          o Heavy RNA_transcription using embryonic genes; up to this point the
            RNAs used were maternal (stored in the unfertilized egg).
          o Cells start major differentiation processes, losing their
            totipotentiality.
In most animals, a blastopore is formed at the point where cells are entering
the embryo. Two major groups of animals can be distinguished according to the
blastopore's fate. In deuterostomes the anus forms from the blastopore, while
in protostomes it develops into the mouth. See Embryological_origins_of_the
mouth_and_anus for more information.
**** Formation of the early nervous system â neural groove, tube and
notochord[edit] ****
In front of the primitive streak, two longitudinal ridges, caused by a folding
up of the ectoderm, make their appearance, one on either side of the middle
line formed by the streak. These are named the neural_folds; they commence some
little distance behind the anterior end of the embryonic_disk, where they are
continuous with each other, and from there gradually extend backward, one on
either side of the anterior end of the primitive streak. Between these folds is
a shallow median groove, the neural_groove. The groove gradually deepens as the
neural folds become elevated, and ultimately the folds meet and coalesce in the
middle line and convert the groove into a closed tube, the neural_tube or
canal, the ectodermal wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system.
After the coalescence of the neural folds over the anterior end of the
primitive streak, the blastopore no longer opens on the surface but into the
closed canal of the neural tube, and thus a transitory communication, the
neurenteric_canal, is established between the neural tube and the primitive
digestive_tube. The coalescence of the neural folds occurs first in the region
of the hind_brain, and from there extends forward and backward; toward the end
of the third week, the front opening (anterior_neuropore) of the tube finally
closes at the anterior end of the future brain, and forms a recess that is in
contact, for a time, with the overlying ectoderm; the hinder part of the neural
groove presents for a time a rhomboidal_shape, and to this expanded portion the
term sinus_rhomboidalis has been applied. Before the neural groove is closed, a
ridge of ectodermal cells appears along the prominent margin of each neural
fold; this is termed the neural_crest or ganglion ridge, and from it the spinal
and cranial nerve_ganglia and the ganglia of the sympathetic_nervous_system are
developed.[7] By the upward growth of the mesoderm, the neural tube is
ultimately separated from the overlying ectoderm.[8]
Dissection of human embryo
The cephalic end of the neural groove exhibits several dilatations that, when
the tube is shut, assume the form of three vesicles; these constitute the three
primary cerebral_vesicles, and correspond, respectively, to the future 'fore-
brain' (prosencephalon), 'midbrain' (mesencephalon), and 'hind-brain'
(rhombencephalon) (Fig. 18). The walls of the vesicles are developed into the
nervous tissue and neuroglia of the brain, and their cavities are modified to
form its ventricles. The remainder of the tube forms the spinal_cord (medulla
spinalis); from its ectodermal wall the nervous and neuroglial elements of the
spinal cord are developed, while the cavity persists as the central_canal.[8]
**** Formation of the early septum[edit] ****
The extension of the mesoderm takes place throughout the whole of the embryonic
and extra-embryonic areas of the ovum, except in certain regions. One of these
is seen immediately in front of the neural tube. Here the mesoderm extends
forward in the form of two crescentic_masses, which meet in the middle line so
as to enclose behind them an area that is devoid of mesoderm. Over this area,
the ectoderm and endoderm come into direct contact with each other and
constitute a thin membrane, the buccopharyngeal_membrane, which forms a septum
between the primitive mouth and pharynx.[3]
**** Early formation of the heart and other primitive structures[edit] ****
In front of the buccopharyngeal area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm
fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this
region is therefore designated the pericardial area. A second region where the
mesoderm is absent, at least for a time, is that immediately in front of the
pericardial area. This is termed the proamniotic_area, and is the region where
the proamnion is developed; in humans, however, it appears that a proamnion is
never formed. A third region is at the hind end of the embryo, where the
ectoderm and endoderm come into apposition and form the cloacal membrane.[3]
***** Somitogenesis[edit] *****
Main article: Somitogenesis
Somitogenesis is the process by which somites (primitive segments) are
produced. These segmented tissue blocks differentiate into skeletal muscle,
vertebrae, and dermis of all vertebrates.
Somitogenesis begins with the formation of somitomeres (whorls of concentric
mesoderm) marking the future somites in the presomitic mesoderm (unsegmented
paraxial). The presomitic mesoderm gives rise to successive pairs of somites,
identical in appearance that differentiate into the same cell types but the
structures formed by the cells vary depending upon the anteroposterior (e.g.,
the thoracic vertebrae have ribs, the lumbar vertebrae do not). Somites have
unique positional values along this axis and it is thought that these are
specified by the Hox homeotic_genes.
Toward the end of the second week after fertilization, transverse segmentation
of the paraxial_mesoderm begins, and it is converted into a series of well-
defined, more or less cubical masses, also known as the somites, which occupy
the entire length of the trunk on either side of the middle line from the
occipital region of the head. Each segment contains a central cavity (known as
a myocoel), which, however, is soon filled with angular and spindle-shape
cells. The somites lie immediately under the ectoderm on the lateral aspect of
the neural tube and notochord, and are connected to the lateral_mesoderm by the
intermediate_cell_mass. Those of the trunk may be arranged in the following
groups, viz.: cervical 8, thoracic 12, lumbar 5, sacral 5, and coccygeal from 5
to 8. Those of the occipital region of the head are usually described as being
four in number. In mammals, somites of the head can be recognized only in the
occipital region, but a study of the lower vertebrates leads to the belief that
they are present also in the anterior part of the head and that, altogether,
nine segments are represented in the cephalic region.[9]
***** Organogenesis[edit] *****
Main article: Organogenesis
Human embryo, 8-9 weeks, 38 mm
At some point after the different germ layers are defined, organogenesis
begins. The first stage in vertebrates is called neurulation, where the neural
plate folds forming the neural tube (see above).[2] Other common organs or
structures that arise at this time include the heart and somites (also above),
but from now on embryogenesis follows no common pattern among the different
taxa of the animal_kingdom.
In most animals organogenesis, along with morphogenesis, results in a larva.
The hatching of the larva, which must then undergo metamorphosis, marks the end
of embryonic development.
