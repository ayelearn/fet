A dosa is a cooked flat thin layered rice batter, originating from the Indian
subcontinent, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe
in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black_gram ground together in
a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a typical part of the
Southern_Indian and Sri_Lankan_Tamil diets, but the dish is now popular all
over the Indian_subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with
sambar, a stuffing of potatoes, and chutney. They can be consumed with idli
podi as well.

***** History[edit] *****
Dosas are indigenous to South_India; their exact birthplace in that region is a
matter of conjecture. [1] According to historian P._Thankappan_Nair, dosa
originated in the Udupi town of present-day Karnataka.[2] According to food
historian K._T._Achaya, dosa (as dosai) was already in use in the ancient_Tamil
country around the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam_literature.
[3]
In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably
because of the dish's association with the Udupi_restaurants.[1] Also, the
original Tamil dosa was softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of
dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka.[4] A recipe for dosa (as dosaka)
can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by
Someshvara_III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.[5]
After the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular
in the North. In Delhi the Madras Hotel[6] in Connaught Place became a landmark
that was one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine.[7] It
arrived in Mumbai with the Udupi restaurants in the 1930s.[8] K. Krishna Rao,
who ran Old_Woodlands in Chennai during the early 1940s, is sometimes regarded
to be the originator of the masala dosa in its modern form.[citation_needed]
***** Names[edit] *****

Dosas are known by several names. The standard transliterations and
pronunciations of the word in various South Indian languages are as follows:
Language              Transliteration Pronunciation (IPA)
Kannada: Ã Â²Â¦Ã Â³Â‹ÃdÃ…ÂseÂ³Â†     [dÃŒÂªoÃ‹Âse]
Tulu:Ã Â²Â¦Ã Â³Â‹Ã Â²ÂdÃ…Âse         [dÃŒÂªo:se]
Malayalam: Ã Â´Â¦Ã ÂµÂdÃ…Âsa         [dÃŒÂªoÃ‹ÂÃ‰Â•a]

***** Nutrition[edit] *****
Dosa with chutney and sambar traditionally served in banana leaf
Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or saturated fats.
As its key ingredients are rice and black_gram, it is also a good source of
protein.[10] One home made plain dosa without oil contains about 112 calories,
of which 84% is carbohydrates and 16% proteins.[11] The fermentation process
increases the vitamin_B and vitamin_C content.[12] There are also instant mix
products for making dosa which usually contain higher amounts of rice.
***** Preparation[edit] *****
[File:Dosa preparation.ogv]Play_media
Dosa making
A mixture of rice and black_gram that has been soaked in water is ground finely
to form a batter. Some add a handful of fenugreek seeds soaked along with the
rice. The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 4:1 or 5:1. The batter is
allowed to ferment overnight. After the overnight fermentation, the batter is
mixed with water to get the desired thickness. The batter is then ladled onto a
hot tava (griddle) greased with oil or ghee (clarified butter). It is spread
out with the base of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either
to be thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy. A dosa is served hot, either
folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is also usually served with chutney
and sambar. The mixture of black grams and rice can be replaced with highly
refined wheat flour or semolina.

***** Serving[edit] *****
Dosa can be stuffed with fillings of vegetables and sauces to make a quick
meal. They are typically served with a vegetarian side_dish which varies
according to regional and personal preferences. Common side items are:
    * Sambar
    * Chutney: examples include coconut chutney (a semi-solid paste made up of
      coconut, dal (lentils), green chilli and mint or coriander)
    * There are varieties of chutney served along with Dosa[13]
    * Idli_podi or milagaipodi (in Tamil): a powder of chilli with spices and
      sometimes desiccated coconut, mixed with sesame oil or groundnut oil or
      ghee
    * Indian_pickles
***** Variations[edit] *****
The most popular version is the masala dosa, with a filling of the potato
masala. Mysore masala is the spicier version of it. Sada (plain) is without
filling; paper dosa is a thin and crisp version. Rava dosa is made crispier
using semolina.[14] Newer recipes have been developed that use fusion.[15]
Though dosa typically refers to the version made with rice and lentils, many
other versions exist.
