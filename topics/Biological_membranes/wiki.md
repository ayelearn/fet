Cross-section view of the structures that can be formed by phospholipids in an
aqueous solution
A biological membrane or biomembrane is an enclosing or separating membrane
that acts as a selectively_permeable barrier within living_things. Biological
membranes, in the form of eukaryotic cell_membranes, consist of a phospholipid
bilayer with embedded, integral and peripheral_proteins used in communication
and transportation of chemicals and ions. The bulk of lipid in a cell membrane
provides a fluid matrix for proteins to rotate and laterally diffuse for
physiological functioning. Proteins are adapted to high membrane_fluidity
environment of lipid_bilayer with the presence of an annular_lipid_shell,
consisting of lipid molecules bound tightly to surface of integral_membrane
proteins. The cell membranes are different from the isolating tissues formed by
layers of cells, such as mucous_membranes, basement_membranes, and serous
membranes.

***** Composition[edit] *****
Main articles: Cell_membrane and Lipid_bilayer
**** Asymmetry[edit] ****
[A_fluid_membrane_model_of_the_phospholipid_bilayer.]
The lipid bilayer consists of two layers- an outer leaflet and an inner
leaflet.[1] The components of bilayers are distributed unequally between the
two surfaces to create asymmetry between the outer and inner surfaces.[2] This
asymmetric organization is important for cell functions such as cell signaling.
[3] The asymmetry of the biological membrane reflects the different functions
of the two leaflets of the membrane.[4] As seen in the fluid membrane_model of
the phospholipid bilayer, the outer leaflet and inner leaflet of the membrane
are asymmetrical in their composition. Certain proteins and lipids rest only on
one surface of the membrane and not the other.
â¢ Both the plasma membrane and internal membranes have cytosolic and
exoplasmic faces â¢ This orientation is maintained during membrane trafficking
â proteins, lipids, glycoconjugates facing the lumen of the ER and Golgi get
expressed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. In eucaryotic
cells, new phospholipids are manufactured by enzymes bound to the part of the
endoplasmic reticulum membrane that faces the cytosol.[5] These enzymes, which
use free fatty acids as substrates, deposit all newly made phospholipids into
the cytosolic half of the bilayer. To enable the membrane as a whole to grow
evenly, half of the new phospholipid molecules then have to be transferred to
the opposite monolayer. This transfer is catalyzed by enzymes called flippases.
In the plasma membrane, flippases transfer specific phospholipids selectively,
so that different types become concentrated in each monolayer.[5]
Using selective flippases is not the only way to produce asymmetry in lipid
bilayers, however. In particular, a different mechanism operates for
glycolipidsâthe lipids that show the most striking and consistent asymmetric
distribution in animal_cells.[5]
**** Lipids[edit] ****
The biological membrane is made up of lipids with hydrophobic tails and
hydrophilic heads.[6] The hydrophobic tails are hydrocarbon tails whose length
and saturation is important in characterizing the cell.[7] Lipid rafts occur
when lipid species and proteins aggregate in domains in the membrane. These
help organize membrane components into localized areas that are involved in
specific processes, such as signal transduction.
Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, have a unique lipid composition. The bilayer
of red blood cells is composed of cholesterol and phospholipids in equal
proportions by weight.[7] Erythrocyte membrane plays a crucial role in blood
clotting. In the bilayer of red blood cells is phosphatidylserine.[8] This is
usually in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, it is flipped to the
outer membrane to be used during blood clotting.[8]
**** Proteins[edit] ****
Phospholipid bilayers contain different proteins. These membrane_proteins have
various functions and characteristics and catalyze different chemical
reactions. Integral proteins span the membranes with different domains on
either side.[6] Integral proteins hold strong association with the lipid
bilayer and cannot easily become detached.[9] They will dissociate only with
chemical treatment that breaks the membrane. Peripheral proteins are unlike
integral proteins in that they hold weak interactions with the surface of the
bilayer and can easily become dissociated from the membrane.[6] Peripheral
proteins are located on only one face of a membrane and create membrane
asymmetry.

**** Oligosaccharides[edit] ****
Oligosaccharides are sugar containing polymers. In the membrane, they can be
covalently bound to lipids to form glycolipids or covalently bound to proteins
to form glycoproteins. Membranes contain sugar-containing lipid molecules known
as glycolipids. In the bilayer, the sugar groups of glycolipids are exposed at
the cell surface, where they can form hydrogen bonds.[9] Glycolipids provide
the most extreme example of asymmetry in the lipid bilayer.[10] Glycolipids
perform a vast number of functions in the biological membrane that are mainly
communicative, including cell recognition and cell-cell adhesion. Glycoproteins
are integral proteins.[2] They play an important role in the immune response
and protection.[11]
***** Formation[edit] *****
The phospholipid bilayer is formed due to the aggregation of membrane_lipids in
aqueous solutions.[4] Aggregation is caused by the hydrophobic_effect, where
hydrophobic ends come into contact with each other and are sequestered away
from water.[6] This arrangement maximises hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic
heads and water while minimising unfavorable contact between hydrophobic tails
and water.[10] The increase in available hydrogen bonding increases the entropy
of the system, creating a spontaneous process.
***** Function[edit] *****
Biological molecules are amphiphilic or amphipathic, i.e. are simultaneously
hydrophobic and hydrophilic.[6] The phospholipid bilayer contains charged
hydrophilic headgroups, which interact with polar water. The lipids also
contain hydrophobic tails, which meet with the hydrophobic tails of the
complementary layer. The hydrophobic tails are usually fatty acids that differ
in lengths.[10] The interactions of lipids, especially the hydrophobic tails,
determine the lipid_bilayer_physical_properties such as fluidity.
Membranes in cells typically define enclosed spaces or compartments in which
cells may maintain a chemical or biochemical environment that differs from the
outside. For example, the membrane around peroxisomes shields the rest of the
cell from peroxides, chemicals that can be toxic to the cell, and the cell
membrane separates a cell from its surrounding medium. Peroxisomes are one form
of vacuole found in the cell that contain by-products of chemical reactions
within the cell. Most organelles are defined by such membranes, and are called
"membrane-bound" organelles.
**** Selective permeability[edit] ****
Probably the most important feature of a biomembrane is that it is a
selectively permeable structure. This means that the size, charge, and other
chemical properties of the atoms and molecules attempting to cross it will
determine whether they succeed in doing so. Selective permeability is essential
for effective separation of a cell or organelle from its surroundings.
Biological membranes also have certain mechanical or elastic properties that
allow them to change shape and move as required.
Generally, small hydrophobic molecules can readily cross phospholipid bilayers
by simple diffusion.[12]
Particles that are required for cellular function but are unable to diffuse
freely across a membrane enter through a membrane transport protein or are
taken in by means of endocytosis, where the membrane allows for a vacuole to
join onto it and push its contents into the cell. Many types of specialized
plasma membranes can separate cell from external environment: apical,
basolateral, presynaptic and postsynaptic ones, membranes of flagella, cilia,
microvillus, filopodia and lamellipodia, the sarcolemma of muscle cells, as
well as specialized myelin and dendritic_spine membranes of neurons. Plasma
membranes can also form different types of "supramembrane" structures such as
caveolae, postsynaptic density, podosome, invadopodium, desmosome,
hemidesmosome, focal adhesion, and cell junctions. These types of membranes
differ in lipid and protein composition.
Distinct types of membranes also create intracellular organelles: endosome;
smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum; sarcoplasmic reticulum; Golgi
apparatus; lysosome; mitochondrion (inner and outer membranes); nucleus (inner
and outer membranes); peroxisome; vacuole; cytoplasmic granules; cell vesicles
(phagosome, autophagosome, clathrin-coated vesicles, COPI-coated and COPII-
coated vesicles) and secretory vesicles (including synaptosome, acrosomes,
melanosomes, and chromaffin granules). Different types of biological membranes
have diverse lipid and protein compositions. The content of membranes defines
their physical and biological properties. Some components of membranes play a
key role in medicine, such as the efflux pumps that pump drugs out of a cell.
**** Fluidity[edit] ****
The hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer is constantly in motion
because of rotations around the bonds of lipid tails.[13] Hydrophobic tails of
a bilayer bend and lock together. However, because of hydrogen bonding with
water, the hydrophilic head groups exhibit less movement as their rotation and
mobility are constrained.[13] This results in increasing viscosity of the lipid
bilayer closer to the hydrophilic heads.[6]
Below a transition temperature, a lipid bilayer loses fluidity when the highly
mobile lipids exhibits less movement becoming a gel-like solid.[14] The
transition temperature depends on such components of the lipid bilayer as the
hydrocarbon chain length and the saturation of its fatty acids. Temperature-
dependence fluidity constitutes an important physiological attribute for
bacteria and cold-blooded organisms. These organisms maintain a constant
fluidity by modifying membrane lipid fatty acid composition in accordance with
differing temperatures.[6]
In animal cells, membrane fluidity is modulated by the inclusion of the sterol
cholesterol. This molecule is present in especially large amounts in the plasma
membrane, where it constitutes approximately 20% of the lipids in the membrane
by weight. Because cholesterol molecules are short and rigid, they fill the
spaces between neighboring phospholipid molecules left by the kinks in their
unsaturated hydrocarbon tails. In this way, cholesterol tends to stiffen the
bilayer, making it more rigid and less permeable.[5]
For all cells, membrane fluidity is important for many reasons. It enables
membrane proteins to diffuse rapidly in the plane of the bilayer and to
interact with one another, as is crucial, for example, in cell_signaling. It
permits membrane lipids and proteins to diffuse from sites where they are
inserted into the bilayer after their synthesis to other regions of the cell.
It allows membranes to fuse with one another and mix their molecules, and it
ensures that membrane molecules are distributed evenly between daughter cells
when a cell divides. If biological membranes were not fluid, it is hard to
imagine how cells could live, grow, and reproduce.[5]
