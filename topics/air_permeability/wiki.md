****** Units of textile measurement ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Textile fibers, threads, yarns and fabrics are measured in a multiplicity of
units.
    * A fiber, a single filament of natural material, such as cotton, linen or
      wool, or artificial material such as nylon, polyester, metal or mineral
      fiber, or man-made cellulosic fibre like viscose, Modal, Lyocell or other
      rayon fiber is measured in terms of linear_mass_density, the weight of a
      given length of fiber. Various units are used to refer to the measurement
      of a fiber, such as: the denier and tex (linear mass density of fibers),
      super_S (fineness of wool fiber), worsted_count, woolen count, linen
      count_(wet_spun) (or Number English (Ne)), cotton_count (or Number
      English (Ne)), Number metric (Nm) and yield (the reciprocal of denier and
      tex).
    * A yarn, a spun agglomeration of fibers used for knitting, weaving or
      sewing, is measured in terms of cotton count and yarn density.
      Thread made from two threads plied together, each consisting of three
      yarns
    * Thread, usually consisting of multiple yarns plied together producing a
      long, thin strand used in sewing or weaving, is measured in the same
      units as yarn.
    * Fabric, cloth typically produced by weaving, knitting or knotting textile
      fibers, yarns or threads, is measured in units such as the momme, thread
      count (a measure of the coarseness or fineness of fabric), ends_per_inch_
      (e.p.i) and picks_per_inch_(p.p.i).

***** Fibers[edit] *****
**** Micronaire[edit] ****
Micronaire is a measure of the air_permeability of cotton_fiber and is an
indication of fineness and maturity.[1] Micronaire affects various aspects of
cotton processing.[2]
**** Micron[edit] ****
Main article: Micrometre
One millionth of a meter, or one thousandth of a millimeter; about one-fourth
the width of a strand of spider silk.
**** S or super S number[edit] ****
Main article: S_number_(wool)
Not a true unit of measure, S or super S number is an index of the fineness of
wool fiber and is most commonly seen as a label on wool apparel, fabric, and
yarn.

    * Wool_measurement
***** Slivers, tops and rovings[edit] *****
Yarn spinning factory
Slivers, tops and rovings are terms used in the worsted process. The sliver
come off the card, tops come after the comb, rovings come before a yarn, and
all have a heavier linear_density.
**** Grams per meter[edit] ****
If the metric system is in use the linear density of slivers and tops is given
in grams per meter. Tops destined for machine processing are typically 20 grams
per meter. Hobby spinners typical use a little heavier top.
**** Yield[edit] ****
Similar to tex and denier, yield is a term that helps describe the linear
density of a roving of fibers. However, unlike tex and denier, yield is the
inverse of linear_density and is usually expressed in yards per pound (yd/lb).
Tex (g/km) Yield (yd/lb)

**** Linear density[edit] ****
There are two systems used for presenting linear density, direct and indirect.
When the direct method is used the length is fixed and the weight of yarn is
measured, for example, tex gives the weight in grams of one kilometer of yarn.
An indirect method fixes the weight and gives the length of yarn created.
*** Units[edit] ***
The textile industry has a long history and there are various units in use. Tex
is more likely to be used in Canada and Continental_Europe, while denier
remains more common in the United States and United Kingdom. The International
System_of_Units uses kilogram per meter for linear density.
    * den (denier) grams (0.035 oz) per 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) of yarn. Den is a
      direct measure of linear density.[3]
    * dtex (denier; deci-tex) grams (0.035 oz) per 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) of
      yarn. Dtex is a direct measure of linear density.[3]
    * gr/yard grains (0.065 g) per yard (0.91 m) of yarn. Gr/yard is a direct
      measure of linear density.
    * ECC or NeC or Ne (English Cotton Count) The number of 840 yards (770 m)
      lengths per pound (0.45 kg). ECC is an indirect measure of linear
      density. It is the number of hanks of skein material that weighs 1 pound
      (0.45 kg). Under this system, the higher the number, the finer the yarn.
      In the United States cotton counts between 1 and 20 are referred to as
      coarse counts. A regular single-knit T-shirt can be between 20 and 40
      count; fine bed sheets are usually in the range of 40 to 80 count. The
      number is now widely used in the staple fiber industry.[3]
    * Lea or NeL (linen Count) The number of 300 yards (270 m) lengths per 1
      pound (0.45 kg) of yarn. Lea is an indirect measure of linear density.
    * NeK or NeW (Worsted Count). The number of 560 yards (510 m) lengths per 1
      pound (0.45 kg) of yarn. NeK is an indirect measure of linear density.[3]
      NeK is also referred to as the Spinning_count.
    * NeL or Lea (Linen Count). The number of 300 yards (270 m) lengths per 1
      pound (0.45 kg) of yarn. NeL is an indirect measure of linear density.
    * NeS (Woollen Count or Yorkshire skein). The number of 256 yards (234 m)
      lengths per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of yarn. NeS is an indirect measure of
      linear density. One of the best known of the many different woollen yarn
      counts.[3]
    * tex grams (0.035 oz) per kilometer (0.62 mi) of yarn. tex is a direct
      measure of linear density.[3] Tex is used for measuring fiber size in
      many products, including cigarette filters, optical cable, yarn and
      fabric.
    * filament tex grams (0.035 oz) per kilometer (0.62 mi) of a single
      filament.

**** Denier[edit] ****
Denier (/ËdÉniÉr/) or den (abbreviated D), a unit of measure for the linear
mass_density of fibers, is the mass in grams per 9000 meters of the fiber.[4]
The denier is based on a natural reference: a single strand of silk is
approximately one denier; a 9000-meter strand of silk weighs about one gram.
The term denier comes from the French_denier, a coin of small value (worth
&#x200b;1⁄12 sou). Applied to yarn, a denier was held to be equal in weight to
1⁄24 ounce (1.2 g). Microdenier describes filaments that weigh less than 1 g
per 9000 m.
There is a difference between filament and total measurements in deniers. Both
are defined as above; but the first relates to a single filament of fiber
(commonly called denier per filament (DPF)), whereas the second relates to a
yarn.
Broader terms, such as fine may be applied, either because the overall yarn is
fine or because fibers within this yarn are thin. A 75-denier yarn is
considered fine even if it contains only a few fibers, such as thirty 2.5-
denier fibers; but a heavier yarn, such as 150 denier, is considered fine only
if its fibers are individually as thin as one denier.[4]
The following relationship applies to straight, uniform filaments:
      DPF = total denier / quantity of uniform filaments
The denier system of measurement is used on two- and single-filament fibers.
Some common calculations are as follows:[5]
1 denier = 1 g / 9000 m
         = 0.11 mg/m
In practice, measuring 9000 meters is both time-consuming and unrealistic.
Generally a sample of 900 meters is weighed, and the result is multiplied by
ten to obtain the denier weight.
    * A fiber is generally considered a microfiber if it is one denier or less.
    * A one-denier polyester fiber has a diameter[6] of about ten micrometers.
    * In tights and pantyhose, the linear density of yarn used in the
      manufacturing process determines the opacity of the article in the
      following categories of commerce: ultra sheer (below 10 denier), sheer
      (10 to 30 denier), semi-opaque (30 to 40 denier), opaque (40 to 70
      denier) and thick opaque (70 denier or higher).[7]
For single fibers, instead of weighing, a machine called a vibroscope is used.
A known length of the fiber (usually 20 mm) is set to vibrate, and its
fundamental frequency measured, allowing the calculation of the mass and thus
the linear_density.
**** Yarn length[edit] ****
Given the linear density and weight the yarn length can be calculated; for
example:
l/m = 1693 Ã lm/Nec Ã m/kg, where l/m is the yarn length in meters, lm/Nec is
the English cotton count and m/kg is the yarn weight in kilograms.
The following length units are defined:
    * Bundle: usually 10 pounds (4.5 kg)
    * Hank a length of 7 leas or 840 yards (770 m)
    * Lea â 120 yards (110 m)
    * Spyndle â 14,400 yards (13,200 m). Used in the English rope industry
    * Thread: a length of 54 inches (1.4 m) (the circumference of a warp beam)
***** Fabrics[edit] *****
**** Mommes[edit] ****
Mommes (mm), traditionally used to measure silk fabrics, the weight in pounds
of a piece of fabric if it were sized 45 inches by 100 yards (1.2 m by 90 m).
One momme = 4.340 g/mÂ²; 8 mommes is approximately 1 ounce per square yard or
35 g/mÂ².
The momme is based on the standard width of silk of 45 inches (1.2 m) wide
(though silk is regularly produced in 55-inch (1.4 m) widths, and, uncommonly,
in even larger widths).
The usual range of momme weight for different weaves of silk are:
    * Habutaiâ5 to 16 mm
    * Chiffonâ6 to 8 mm (can be made in double thickness, i.e. 12 to 16 mm)
    * Crepe_de_Chineâ12 to 16 mm
    * Gauzeâ3 to 5 mm
    * Raw_silkâ35 to 40 mm (heavier silks appear more 'wooly')
    * Organzaâ4 to 6 mm
    * Charmeuseâ12 to 30 mm
The higher the weight in mommes, the more durable the weave, and the more
suitable it is for heavy-duty use. And, the heavier the silk, the more opaque
it becomes. This can vary even between the same kind of silk. For example,
lightweight charmeuse is translucent when used in clothing, but 30-momme
charmeuse is opaque.
**** Thread count[edit] ****
Thread count or threads per inch (TPI)[8] is a measure of the coarseness or
fineness of fabric. It is measured by counting the number of threads contained
in one square inch of fabric or one square centimeter, including both the
length (warp) and width (weft) threads. The thread count is the number of
threads counted along two sides (up and across) of the square inch, added
together. It is used especially in regard to cotton linens such as bed_sheets,
and has been known to be used in the classification of towels. There is a
common misconception that thread count is an important consideration when
purchasing bedding. However, linen experts claim that beyond a thread count of
400, there is no difference in quality. The amount of thread that can fit into
a square inch of fabric is limited, suggesting that bedding beyond 400 count is
likely a marketing strategy.[9] Inflated thread counts are usually the result
of including the number of strands in a twisted yarn in the claimed thread
count.[10]
*** Industry standard[edit] ***
Thread count is often used as a measure of fabric quality, so that "standard"
cotton thread counts are around 150 while good-quality sheets start at 180 and
a count of 200 or higher is considered percale. Some, but not all, of the
extremely high thread counts (typically over 500) tend to be misleading as they
usually count the individual threads in "plied" yarns (a yarn that is made by
twisting together multiple finer threads). For marketing purposes, a fabric
with 250 two-ply yarns in both the vertical and horizontal direction could have
the component threads counted to a 1000 thread count although according to the
National_Textile_Association (NTA),[11] which cites the international standards
group ASTM, accepted industry practice is to count each thread as one, even
threads spun as two- or three-ply yarn. The Federal_Trade_Commission in an
August 2005 letter to NTA agreed that consumers 'could be deceived or misled'
by inflated thread counts.[12] In 2002, ASTM proposed a definition for "thread
count"[13] that has been called "the industry's first formal definition for
thread count".[14] A minority on the ASTM committee argued for the higher yarn
count number obtained by counting each single yarn in a plied yarn and cited as
authority the provision relating to woven fabric in the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States, which states each ply should be counted as one
using the "average yarn number."[14] In 2017, the Federal Trade Commission
issued a General Exclusion Order barring entry of woven textile fabrics and
products marked with inflated thread counts. The inflated thread counts were
deemed false advertising under section 43 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1125(a)
(1)(B). [15]
**** Ends per inch[edit] ****
Ends per inch (EPI or e.p.i.) is the number of warp threads per inch of woven
fabric.[8][16] In general, the higher the ends per inch, the finer the fabric
is. The current fashion is to wear T-shirts with a higher thread count, such as
soft and comfortable "30 single" tee shirt that has 30 threads per inch as
contrasted to the standard T-shirt with an 18 thread count per inch.
Ends per inch is very commonly used by weavers who must use the number of ends
per inch in order to pick the right reed to weave with. The number of ends per
inch varies on the pattern to be woven and the thickness of the thread. The
number of times the thread can be wrapped around a ruler in adjacent turns over
an inch is called the wraps per inch. Plain_weaves generally use half the
number of wraps per inch for the number of ends per inch, whereas denser weaves
like a twill weave will use a higher ratio like two-thirds of the number of
wraps per inch. Finer threads require more threads per inch than thick ones,
and thus result in a higher number of ends per inch.
The number of ends per inch in a piece of woven cloth varies depending on the
stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number
of ends per inch, which is directly related to the size reed being used. After
weaving, the number of ends per inch will increase, and it will increase again
after being washed. This increase in the number of ends per inch (and picks per
inch) and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The
take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly
the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of
ends per inch increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic
yarns and fibers.
**** Picks per inch[edit] ****
Picks per inch/Inch (or p.p.i.) is the number of weft threads per inch of woven
fabric.[16] A pick is a single weft thread,[17] hence the term. In general, the
higher the picks per inch, the finer the fabric is.
**** Air permeability[edit] ****
Air permeability is a measure of the ability of air to pass through a fabric.
[18] Air permeability is defined as "the volume of air in cubic centimeters
(cm3) which is passed through in one second through 100cm2 of the fabric at a
pressure difference of 10 cm head of water",[19] also known as the Gurley_unit.
Factors that affect air permeability include porosity, fabric thickness and
construction, yarn density, twist, and crimp, layering, and moisture within the
fabric.
The concept of air permeability is important for the design of active_wear[18]
and insect_netting.[19]

**** Martindale[edit] ****
Main article: Martindale_(unit)
The unit Martindale quantifies a textile's resistance to abrasion when used for
upholstery.
