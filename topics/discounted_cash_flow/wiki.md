In finance, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a method of valuing a
project, company, or asset using the concepts of the time_value_of_money. All
future cash_flows are estimated and discounted by using cost of capital to give
their present_values (PVs). The sum of all future cash flows, both incoming and
outgoing, is the net_present_value (NPV), which is taken as the value of the
cash flows in question.[1]
Using DCF analysis to compute the NPV takes as input cash flows and a discount
rate and gives as output a present value. The opposite process takes cash flows
and a price (present value) as inputs, and provides as output the discount
rate; this is used in bond markets to obtain the yield.
Discounted cash flow analysis is widely used in investment finance, real_estate
development, corporate_financial management and patent_valuation. It was used
in industry as early as the 1700s or 1800s, widely discussed in financial
economics in the 1960s, and became widely used in U.S. Courts in the 1980s and
1990s.
Example DCF calculation
To show how discounted cash flow analysis is performed, consider the following
example.
      John Doe buys a house for $100,000. Three years later, he expects to be
      able to sell this house for $150,000.
Simple subtraction suggests that the value of his profit on such a transaction
would be $150,000 â $100,000 = $50,000, or 50%. If that $50,000 is amortized
over the three years, his implied annual return (known as the internal_rate_of
return) would be about 14.5%. Looking at those figures, he might be justified in
thinking that the purchase looked like a good idea. 1.1453 x $100,000 = $150,000,
approximately.
However, since three years have passed between the purchase and the sale, any
cash flow from the sale must be discounted accordingly. At the time John Doe buys
the house, the 3-year US_Treasury_Note rate is 5% per annum. Treasury Notes are
generally considered to be inherently less risky than real estate, since the
value of the Note is guaranteed by the US Government and there is a liquid market
for the purchase and sale of T-Notes. If he hadn't put his money into buying the
house, he could have invested it in the relatively safe T-Notes instead. This 5%
per annum can, therefore, be regarded as the risk-free_interest_rate for the
relevant period (3 years).
Using the DPV formula above (FV=$150,000, i=0.05, n=3), that means that the value
of $150,000 received in three years actually has a present_value of $129,576
(rounded off). In other words, we would need to invest $129,576 in a T-Bond now
to get $150,000 in 3 years almost risk-free. This is a quantitative way of
showing that money in the future is not as valuable as money in the present
($150,000 in 3 years isn't worth the same as $150,000 now; it is worth $129,576
now).
Subtracting the purchase price of the house ($100,000) from the present_value
results in the net_present_value of the whole transaction, which would be $29,576
or a little more than 29% of the purchase price. Another way of looking at the
deal as the excess return achieved (over the risk-free rate) is (114.5 - 105)/
(100 + 5) or approximately 9.0% (still very respectable).
But what about risk? We assume that the $150,000 is John's best estimate of the
sale price that he will be able to achieve in 3 years time (after deducting all
expenses). There is a lot of uncertainty about house prices, and the outcome may
end up higher or lower than this estimate. (The house John is buying is in a
"good neighborhood," but market values have been rising quite a lot lately and
the real estate market analysts in the media are talking about a slow-down and
higher interest rates. There is a probability that John might not be able to get
the full $150,000 he is expecting in three years due to a slowing of price
appreciation, or that loss of liquidity in the real estate market might make it
very hard for him to sell at all.)
Under normal circumstances, people entering into such transactions are risk-
averse, that is to say that they are prepared to accept a lower expected return
for the sake of avoiding risk. See Capital_asset_pricing_model for a further
discussion of this. For the sake of the example (and this is a gross
simplification), let's assume that he values this particular risk at 5% per annum
(we could perform a more precise probabilistic analysis of the risk, but that is
beyond the scope of this article). Therefore, allowing for this risk, his
expected return is now 9.0% per annum (the arithmetic is the same as above). And
the excess return over the risk-free rate is now (109 - 105)/(100 + 5) which
comes to approximately 3.8% per annum.
That return rate may seem low, but it is still positive after all of our
discounting, suggesting that the investment decision is probably a good one: it
produces enough profit to compensate for tying up capital and incurring risk with
a little extra left over. When investors and managers perform DCF analysis, the
important thing is that the net present value of the decision after discounting
all future cash flows at least be positive (more than zero). If it is negative,
that means that the investment decision would actually lose money even if it
appears to generate a nominal profit. For instance, if the expected sale price of
John Doe's house in the example above was not $150,000 in three years, but
$130,000 in three years or $150,000 in five years, then on the above assumptions
buying the house would actually cause John to lose money in present-value terms
(about $3,000 in the first case, and about $8,000 in the second). Similarly, if
the house was located in an undesirable neighborhood and the Federal_Reserve_Bank
was about to raise interest rates by five percentage points, then the risk factor
would be a lot higher than 5%: it might not be possible for him to predict a
profit in discounted terms even if he thinks he could sell the house for $200,000
in three years.
In this example, only one future cash flow was considered. For a decision which
generates multiple cash flows in multiple time periods, all the cash flows must
be discounted and then summed into a single net_present_value. See #Methods_of
appraisal_of_a_company_or_project for cases where multiple periods are
considered.

***** Discount rate[edit] *****
The act of discounting future cash flows answers "how much money would have to
be invested currently, at a given rate of return, to yield the forecast cash
flow, at its future date?" In other words, discounting returns the present
value of future cash flows, where the rate used is the cost_of_capital that
appropriately reflects the risk, and timing, of the cash flows; see further
under John_Burr_Williams#Theory.
This "required return" thus incorporates:
   1. Time_value_of_money (risk-free_rate) â according to the theory of time
      preference, investors would rather have cash immediately than having to
      wait and must therefore be compensated by paying for the delay
   2. Risk_premium â reflects the extra return investors demand because they
      want to be compensated for the risk that the cash flow might not
      materialize after all.
For the latter, various models have been developed, where the premium is
(typically) calculated as a function of the asset's performance with reference
to some macroeconomic variable - for example, the CAPM compares the asset's
historical returns to the "overall_market's"; see Capital_asset_pricing_model
#Asset-specific_required_return and Asset_pricing_#General_Equilibrium_Asset
Pricing.
An alternate, although less common approach, is to apply a "fundamental
valuation" method, such as the "T-model", which instead relies on accounting
information. (Other methods of discounting, such as hyperbolic_discounting, are
studied in academia and said to reflect intuitive decision-making, but are not
generally used in industry. In this context the above is referred to as
"exponential discounting".)
Note that "expected_return", although formally the mathematical_expected_value,
is often used interchangeably with the above wording, where "expected" means
"required" in the corresponding sense.
***** History[edit] *****
Discounted cash flow calculations have been used in some form since money was
first lent at interest in ancient times. Studies of ancient Egyptian and
Babylonian mathematics suggest that they used techniques similar to discounting
of the future cash flows. This method of asset valuation differentiated between
the accounting book value, which is based on the amount paid for the asset.[2]
Following the stock market crash of 1929, discounted cash flow analysis gained
popularity as a valuation method for stocks. Irving_Fisher in his 1930 book The
Theory of Interest and John_Burr_Williams's 1938 text The_Theory_of_Investment
Value first formally expressed the DCF method in modern economic terms.[3]
***** Mathematics[edit] *****
**** Discounted cash flows[edit] ****
The discounted cash flow formula is derived from the future_value formula for
calculating the time_value_of_money and compounding returns.
         D C F =    C  F  1     ( 1 + r  )  1      +    C  F  2     ( 1 + r  )
      2      + &#x22EF; +    C  F  n     ( 1 + r  )  n        {\displaystyle
      DCF={\frac {CF_{1}}{(1+r)^{1}}}+{\frac {CF_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}}}+\dotsb +
      {\frac {CF_{n}}{(1+r)^{n}}}}  [DCF = \frac{CF_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{CF_2}{
      (1+r)^2} + \dotsb +
      \frac{CF_n}{(1+r)^n}]
         F V = D C F &#x22C5; ( 1 + r  )  n     {\displaystyle FV=DCF\cdot
      (1+r)^{n}}  [FV = DCF \cdot (1+r)^n]
Thus the discounted present value (for one cash flow in one future period) is
expressed as:
         D P V =    F V   ( 1 + r  )  n        {\displaystyle DPV={\frac {FV}{
      (1+r)^{n}}}}  [DPV =  \frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}]
where
    * DPV is the discounted present value of the future cash flow (FV), or FV
      adjusted for the delay in receipt;
    * FV is the nominal value of a cash flow amount in a future period;
    * r is the interest rate or discount rate, which reflects the cost of tying
      up capital and may also allow for the risk that the payment may not be
      received in full;[4]
    * n is the time in years before the future cash flow occurs.
Where multiple cash flows in multiple time periods are discounted, it is
necessary to sum them as follows:
         D P V =  &#x2211;  t = 0   N      F  V  t     ( 1 + r  )  t
      {\displaystyle DPV=\sum _{t=0}^{N}{\frac {FV_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}}}  [DPV =
      \sum_{t=0}^{N} \frac{FV_t}{(1+r)^{t}}]
for each future cash flow (FV) at any time period (t) in years from the present
time, summed over all time periods. The sum can then be used as a net_present
value figure. If the amount to be paid at time 0 (now) for all the future cash
flows is known, then that amount can be substituted for DPV and the equation
can be solved for r, that is the internal_rate_of_return.
All the above assumes that the interest rate remains constant throughout the
whole period.
If the cash flow stream is assumed to continue indefinitely, the finite
forecast is usually combined with the assumption of constant cash flow growth
beyond the discrete projection period. The total value of such cash flow stream
is the sum of the finite discounted cash flow forecast and the Terminal_value_
(finance).
**** Continuous cash flows[edit] ****
For continuous cash flows, the summation in the above formula is replaced by an
integration:
         D P V =  &#x222B;  0   T   F V ( t )   e  &#x2212; &#x03BB; t   d t =
      &#x222B;  0   T      F V ( t )   ( 1 + r  )  t       d t  ,
      {\displaystyle DPV=\int _{0}^{T}FV(t)\,e^{-\lambda t}dt=\int _{0}^{T}
      {\frac {FV(t)}{(1+r)^{t}}}\,dt\,,}  [{\displaystyle DPV=\int _{0}^{T}FV
      (t)\,e^{-\lambda t}dt=\int _{0}^{T}{\frac {FV(t)}{(1+r)^{t}}}\,dt\,,}]
where     F V ( t )   {\displaystyle FV(t)}  [FV(t)] is now the rate of cash
flow, and     &#x03BB; = log &#x2061; ( 1 + r )   {\displaystyle \lambda =\log
(1+r)}  [{\displaystyle \lambda =\log(1+r)}].
***** Methods of appraisal of a company or project[edit] *****
Here, a spreadsheetvaluation, uses Free_cash_flows to estimate stock's Fair
Value and measure the sensibility of WACC and Perpetual_growth
For these valuation purposes, a number of different DCF methods are
distinguished today, some of which are outlined below. The details are likely
to vary depending on the capital_structure of the company. However the
assumptions used in the appraisal (especially the equity discount rate and the
projection_of_the_cash_flows to be achieved) are likely to be at least as
important as the precise model used. Both the income stream selected and the
associated cost_of_capital model determine the valuation result obtained with
each method. (This is one reason these valuation methods are formally referred
to as the Discounted Future Economic Income methods.) The below is offered as a
simple treatment; for the components / steps of business modeling here, see the
list for "Equity valuation" under Outline_of_finance#Discounted_cash_flow
valuation.
**** Equity-approach[edit] ****
    * Flows_to_equity approach (FTE)
          o Discount the cash flows available to the holders of equity capital,
            after allowing for cost of servicing debt capital
          o Advantages: Makes explicit allowance for the cost of debt capital
          o Disadvantages: Requires judgement on choice of discount rate
**** Entity-approach[edit] ****
    * Adjusted_present_value approach (APV)
          o Discount the cash flows before allowing for the debt capital (but
            allowing for the tax relief obtained on the debt capital)
          o Advantages: Simpler to apply if a specific project is being valued
            which does not have earmarked debt capital finance
          o Disadvantages: Requires judgement on choice of discount rate; no
            explicit allowance for cost of debt capital, which may be much
            higher than a risk-free_rate
    * Weighted_average_cost_of_capital approach (WACC)
          o Derive a weighted cost of the capital obtained from the various
            sources and use that discount rate to discount the cash flows from
            the project
          o Advantages: Overcomes the requirement for debt capital finance to
            be earmarked to particular projects
          o Disadvantages: Care must be exercised in the selection of the
            appropriate income stream. The net cash flow to total invested
            capital is the generally accepted choice.
    * Total_cash_flow approach (TCF)[clarification_needed]
          o This distinction illustrates that the Discounted Cash Flow method
            can be used to determine the value of various business ownership
            interests. These can include equity or debt holders.
          o Alternatively, the method can be used to value the company based on
            the value of total invested capital. In each case, the differences
            lie in the choice of the income stream and discount rate. For
            example, the net cash flow to total invested capital and WACC are
            appropriate when valuing a company based on the market value of all
            invested capital.[5]
***** Shortcomings[edit] *****
1) Traditional DCF models assume we can accurately forecast revenue and
earnings 3â5 years into the future. But studies have shown that growth is
neither predictable nor persistent.[6]
In other terms, using DCF models is problematic due to the problem of
induction, or presupposing_that_a_sequence_of_events_in_the_future_will_occur
as_it_always_has_in_the_past. Colloquially, in the world of finance, the
problem of induction is often simplified with the common phrase: past returns
are not indicative of future results. In fact, the SEC demands that all mutual
funds use this sentence to warn their investors.[7]
This observation has led some to conclude that DCF models should only be used
to value companies with steady cash flows. For example, DCF models are widely
used to value mature companies in stable industry sectors, such as utilities.
For industries that are especially unpredictable and thus harder to forecast,
DCF models can prove especially challenging.
    * Industry Examples:
          o Real Estate- Investors use DCF models to value commercial real
            estate development projects. This practice has two main
            shortcomings. First, the discount rate assumption relies on the
            market for competing investments at the time of the analysis, which
            may not persist into the future. Second, assumptions about ten-year
            income increases are usually based on historic increases in the
            market rent. Yet the cyclical nature of most real estate markets is
            not factored in. Most real estate loans are made during boom real
            estate markets and these markets usually last fewer than ten years.
            In this case, due to the problem of induction, using a DCF model to
            value commercial real estate during any but the early years of a
            boom market can lead to overvaluation.[8]
          o Early-stage Technology Companies- In valuing startups, the DCF
            method can be applied a number of times, with differing
            assumptions, to assess a range of possible future outcomesâsuch
            as the best, worst and mostly likely case scenarios. Even so, the
            lack of historical company data and uncertainty about factors that
            can affect the company's development make DCF models especially
            difficult for valuing startups. There is a lack of credibility
            regarding future cash flows, future cost of capital, and the
            company's growth rate. By forecasting limited data into an
            unpredictable future, the problem of induction is especially
            pronounced.[9]
2) Traditional DCF models assume that the capital asset pricing model can be
used to assess the riskiness of an investment and set an appropriate discount
rate. But, according to some economists, the capital asset pricing model has
been empirically invalidated.[10]
3) Input-output problem
    * DCF is merely a mechanical valuation tool, which makes it subject to the
      principle "garbage_in,_garbage_out." Small changes in inputs can result
      in large changes in the value of a company. This is especially the case
      with terminal_values, which make up a large proportion of the Discounted
      Cash Flow's final value.
4) Doesn't account for all variables
    * Traditional DCF calculations only consider the financial costs and
      benefits of a decision. They do not include the environmental, social and
      governance performance of an organization.[11]
***** Integrated Future Value (IntFV)[edit] *****
To address the lack of integration of the short and long term importance, value
and risks associated with natural and social capital into the traditional DCF
calculation, companies are valuing their environmental, social and governance
(ESG) performance through an Integrated_Management approach to reporting that
expands DCF or Net Present Value to Integrated Future Value. This allows
companies to value their investments not just for their financial return but
also the long term environmental and social return of their investments. By
highlighting environmental, social and governance performance in reporting,
decision makers have the opportunity to identify new areas for value creation
that are not revealed through traditional financial reporting.[12] The social
cost_of_carbon is one value that can be incorporated into Integrated Future
Value calculations to encompass the damage to society from greenhouse gas
emissions that result from an investment. This is an integrated approach to
reporting that supports Integrated Bottom Line (IBL) decision making, which
takes triple_bottom_line(TBL) a step further and combines financial,
environmental and social performance reporting into one balance sheet. This
approach provides decision makers with the insight to identify opportunities
for value creation that promote growth and change within an organization.[13]
