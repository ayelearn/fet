Nylon is a generic designation for a family of synthetic_polymers, based on
aliphatic or semi-aromatic polyamides. Nylon is a thermoplastic silky material
[1] that can be melt-processed into fibers, films, or shapes.[2]:2 It is made
of repeating_units linked by amide links[3] similar to the peptide_bonds in
proteins. Nylon polymers can be mixed with a wide variety of additives to
achieve many different property variations. Nylon polymers have found
significant commercial applications in fabric and fibers (apparel, flooring and
rubber reinforcement), in shapes (molded parts for cars, electrical equipment,
etc.), and in films (mostly for food packaging).[4]
Nylon was the first commercially successful synthetic thermoplastic polymer.[5]
DuPont began its research project in 1927.[6] The first example of nylon (nylon
6,6) was produced using diamines on February 28, 1935, by Wallace_Hume
Carothers at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont_Experimental_Station.[7]
[8] In response to Carothers' work, Paul_Schlack at IG_Farben developed
nylon 6, a different molecule based on caprolactam, on January 29, 1938.[9]:10
[10]
Nylon was first used commercially in a nylon-bristled toothbrush in 1938,[11]
[12] followed more famously in women's stockings or "nylons" which were shown
at the 1939_New_York_World's_Fair and first sold commercially in 1940.[13]
During World War II, almost all nylon production was diverted to the military
for use in parachutes and parachute_cord. Wartime uses of nylon and other
plastics greatly increased the market for the new materials.[14]

***** History[edit] *****
Wallace_Carothers
**** DuPont and the invention of Nylon[edit] ****
DuPont, founded by ÃleuthÃ¨re_IrÃ©nÃ©e_du_Pont, first produced gunpowder and
later cellulose-based paints. Following WWI, DuPont produced synthetic ammonia
and other chemicals. DuPont began experimenting with the development of
cellulose based fibers, eventually producing the synthetic fiber rayon.
DuPont's experience with rayon was an important precursor to its development
and marketing of nylon.[15]:8,64,236
DuPont's invention of nylon spanned an eleven-year period, ranging from the
initial research program in polymers in 1927 to its announcement in 1938,
shortly before the opening of the 1939 New_York_World's_Fair.[6] The project
grew from a new organizational structure at DuPont, suggested by Charles_Stine
in 1927, in which the chemical department would be composed of several small
research teams that would focus on "pioneering research" in chemistry and would
"lead to practical applications".[15]:92 Harvard instructor Wallace Hume
Carothers was hired to direct the polymer research group. Initially he was
allowed to focus on pure research, building on and testing the theories of
German chemist Hermann_Staudinger.[16] He was very successful, as research he
undertook greatly improved the knowledge of polymers and contributed to
science.[17]
In the spring of 1930, Carothers and his team had already synthesized two new
polymers. One was neoprene, a synthetic rubber greatly used during World War
II.[18] The other was a white elastic but strong paste that would later become
nylon. After these discoveries, Carothers' team was made to shift its research
from a more pure research approach investigating general polymerization to a
more practically-focused goal of finding "one chemical combination that would
lend itself to industrial applications".[15]:94
It wasn't until the beginning of 1935 that a polymer called "polymer 6-6" was
finally produced. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced by
Wallace Carothers on February 28, 1935, at DuPont's research facility at the
DuPont Experimental Station.[7] It had all the desired properties of elasticity
and strength. However, it also required a complex manufacturing process that
would become the basis of industrial production in the future. DuPont obtained
a patent for the polymer in September 1938,[19] and quickly achieved a monopoly
of the fiber.[17] Carothers died 16 months before the announcement of nylon,
therefore he was never able to see his success. [6]
The production of nylon required interdepartmental collaboration between three
departments at DuPont: the Department of Chemical Research, the Ammonia
Department, and the Department of Rayon. Some of the key ingredients of nylon
had to be produced using high_pressure_chemistry, the main area of expertise of
the Ammonia Department. Nylon was considered a âgodsend to the Ammonia
Departmentâ,[15] which had been in financial difficulties. The reactants of
nylon soon constituted half of the Ammonia department's sales and helped them
come out of the period of the Great_Depression by creating jobs and revenue at
DuPont.[15]
DuPont's nylon project demonstrated the importance of chemical_engineering in
industry, helped create jobs, and furthered the advancement of chemical
engineering techniques. In fact, it developed a chemical plant that provided
1800 jobs and used the latest technologies of the time, which are still used as
a model for chemical plants today.[15] The ability to acquire a large number of
chemists and engineers quickly was a huge contribution to the success of
DuPont's nylon project.[15]:100â101 The first nylon plant was located at
Seaford, Delaware, beginning commercial production on December 15, 1939. On
October 26, 1995, the Seaford plant was designated a National_Historic_Chemical
Landmark by the American_Chemical_Society.[20]
**** Early marketing strategies[edit] ****
An important part of nylon's popularity stems from DuPont's marketing strategy.
DuPont promoted the fiber to increase demand before the product was available
to the general market. Nylon's commercial announcement occurred on October 27,
1938, at the final session of the Herald_Tribune's yearly "Forum on Current
Problems", on the site of the approaching New York City world's fair.[16][17]:
141 The "first man-made organic textile fiber" which was derived from "coal,
water and air" and promised to be "as strong as steel, as fine as the spider's
web" was received enthusiastically by the audience, many of them middle-class
women, and made the headlines of most newspapers.[17]:141 Nylon was introduced
as part of "The world of tomorrow" at the 1939 New York World's Fair[21] and
was featured at DuPont's "Wonder World of Chemistry" at the Golden_Gate
International_Exposition in San Francisco in 1939.[16][22] Actual nylon
stockings were not shipped to selected stores in the national market until May
15, 1940. However, a limited number were released for sale in Delaware before
that.[17]:145â146 The first public sale of nylon stockings occurred on
October 24, 1939, in Wilmington, Delaware. 4,000 pairs of stockings were
available, all of which were sold within three hours.[16]
Another added bonus to the campaign was that it meant reducing silk imports
from Japan, an argument that won over many wary customers. Nylon was even
mentioned by President_Roosevelt's cabinet, which addressed its "vast and
interesting economic possibilities" five days after the material was formally
announced.[17]
However, the early excitement over nylon also caused problems. It fueled
unreasonable expectations that nylon would be better than silk, a miracle
fabric as strong as steel that would last forever and never run.[17]:145â147
[13] Realizing the danger of claims such as "New Hosiery Held Strong as Steel"
and "No More Runs", DuPont scaled back the terms of the original announcement,
especially those stating that nylon would possess the strength of steel.[17]
Also, DuPont executives marketing nylon as a revolutionary man-made material
did not at first realize that some consumers experienced a sense of unease and
distrust, even fear, towards synthetic fabrics.[17]:126â128 A particularly
damaging news story, drawing on DuPont's 1938 patent for the new polymer,
suggested that one method of producing nylon might be to use cadaverine
(pentamethylenediamine),[23] a chemical extracted from corpses. Although
scientists asserted that cadaverine was also extracted by heating coal, the
public often refused to listen. A woman confronted one of the lead scientists
at DuPont and refused to accept that the rumour was not true.[17]:146â147
DuPont changed its campaign strategy, emphasizing that nylon was made from
"coal, air and water", and started focusing on the personal and aesthetic
aspects of nylon, rather than its intrinsic qualities.[17]:146â147 Nylon was
thus domesticated,[17]:151â152 and attention shifted to the material and
consumer aspect of the fiber with slogans like "If it's nylon, it's prettier,
and oh! How fast it dries!".[15]:2
**** Production of nylon fabric[edit] ****

After nylon's nationwide release in 1940, production was increased. 1300 tons
of the fabric were produced during 1940.[15]:100 During their first year on the
market, 64 million pairs of nylon stockings were sold.[15]:101 In 1941, a
second plant was opened in Martinsville,_Virginia due to the success of the
fabric.[24]

While nylon was marketed as the durable and indestructible material of the
people, it was sold at almost twice the price of silk stockings ($4.27 per
pound of nylon versus $2.79 per pound of silk).[15]:101 Sales of nylon
stockings were strong in part due to changes in women's fashion. As Lauren Olds
explains: "by 1939 [hemlines] had inched back up to the knee, closing the
decade just as it started off". The shorter skirts were accompanied by a demand
for stockings that offered fuller coverage without the use of garters to hold
them up.[25]
However, as of February 11, 1942, nylon production was redirected from being a
consumer material to one used by the military.[16] DuPont's production of nylon
stockings and other lingerie stopped, and most manufactured nylon was used to
make parachutes and tents for World_War_II.[26] Although nylon stockings
already made before the war could be purchased, they were generally sold on the
black market for as high as $20.[24]
Once the war ended, the return of nylon was awaited with great anticipation.
Although DuPont projected yearly production of 360 million pairs of stockings,
there were delays in converting back to consumer rather than wartime
production.[16] In 1946, the demand for nylon stockings could not be satisfied,
which led to the Nylon_riots. In one case, an estimated 40,000 people lined up
in Pittsburgh to buy 13,000 pairs of nylons.[13] In the meantime, women cut up
nylon tents and parachutes left from the war in order to make blouses and
wedding dresses.[27][28] Between the end of the war and 1952, production of
stockings and lingerie used 80% of the world's nylon. DuPont put a lot of focus
on catering to the civilian demand, and continually expanded its production.
**** Introduction of nylon blends[edit] ****
As pure nylon hosiery was sold in a wider market, problems became apparent.
Nylon stockings were found to be fragile, in the sense that the thread often
tended to unravel lengthwise, creating 'runs'.[15]:101 People also reported
that pure nylon textiles could be uncomfortable due to nylon's lack of
absorbency.[29] Moisture stayed inside the fabric near the skin under hot or
moist conditions instead of being "wicked" away.[30] Nylon fabric could also be
itchy, and tended to cling and sometimes spark as a result of static electrical
charge built up by friction.[31][32] Also, under some conditions stockings
could decompose[17] turning back into nylon's original components of air, coal,
and water. Scientists explained this as a result of air pollution, attributing
it to London smog in 1952, as well as poor air quality in New York and Los
Angeles.[33][34][35]
The solution found to problems with pure nylon fabric was to blend nylon with
other existing fibers or polymers such as cotton, polyester, and spandex. This
led to the development of a wide array of blended fabrics. The new nylon blends
retained the desirable properties of nylon (elasticity, durability, ability to
be dyed) and kept clothes prices low and affordable.[26]:2 As of 1950, the New
York Quartermaster Procurement Agency (NYQMPA), which developed and tested
textiles for the army and navy, had committed to developing a wool-nylon blend.
They were not the only ones to introduce blends of both natural and synthetic
fibers. America's Textile Reporter referred to 1951 as the "Year of the
blending of the fibers".[36] Fabric blends included mixes like "Bunara" (wool-
rabbit-nylon) and "Casmet" (wool-nylon-fur).[37] In Britain in November 1951,
the inaugural address of the 198th session of the Royal Society for the
Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce focused on the blending of
textiles.[38]
DuPont's Fabric Development Department cleverly targeted French fashion
designers, supplying them with fabric samples. In 1955, designers such as Coco
Chanel, Jean_Patou, and Christian_Dior showed gowns created with DuPont fibers,
and fashion photographer Horst_P._Horst was hired to document their use of
DuPont fabrics.[13] American Fabrics credited blends with providing "creative
possibilities and new ideas for fashions which had been hitherto undreamed of."
[37]
***** Origin of the name[edit] *****
DuPont went through an extensive process to generate names for its new product.
[17]:138â139 In 1940, John W. Eckelberry of DuPont stated that the letters
"nyl" were arbitrary and the "on" was copied from the suffixes of other fibers
such as cotton and Rayon. A later publication by DuPont (Context, vol. 7,
no. 2, 1978) explained that the name was originally intended to be "No-Run"
("run" meaning "unravel"), but was modified to avoid making such an unjustified
claim. Since the products were not really run-proof, the vowels were swapped to
produce "nuron", which was changed to "nilon" "to make it sound less like a
nerve tonic". For clarity in pronunciation, the "i" was changed to "y."[13][39]
***** Longer-term popularity[edit] *****
In spite of oil shortages in the 1970s, consumption of nylon textiles continued
to grow by 7.5 per cent per annum between the 1960s and 1980s.[40] Overall
production of synthetic fibers, however, dropped from 63% of the worlds textile
production in 1965, to 45% of the world's textile production in early 1970s.
[40] The appeal of "new" technologies wore off, and nylon fabric "was going out
of style in the 1970s".[15] Also, consumers became concerned about
environmental costs throughout the production cycle: obtaining the raw
materials (oil), energy use during production, waste produced during creation
of the fiber, and eventual waste disposal of materials that were not
biodegradable.[40] Synthetic fibers have not dominated the market since the
1950s and 1960s. As of 2008[update], nylon continued to represent about 12% (8
million pounds) of the world's production of synthetic fibers.[13] As one of
the largest engineering polymer families, the global demand of nylon resins and
compounds was valued at roughly US$20.5 billion in 2013. The market is expected
to reach US$30 billion by 2020 by following an average annual growth of 5.5%.
[41]
Although pure nylon has many flaws and is now rarely used, its derivatives have
greatly influenced and contributed to society. From scientific discoveries
relating to the production of plastics and polymerization, to economic impact
during the depression and the changing of women's fashion, nylon was a
revolutionary product.[13] The Lunar_Flag_Assembly, the first flag planted on
the moon in a symbolic gesture of celebration, was made of nylon. The flag
itself cost $5.50, but had to have a specially-designed flagpole with a
horizontal bar so that it would appear to "fly".[42][43] One historian
describes nylon as "an object of desire", comparing the invention to Coca-Cola
in the eyes of 20th century consumers.[15]

Nylons are condensation_polymers or copolymers, formed by reacting difunctional
monomers containing equal parts of amine and carboxylic_acid, so that amides
are formed at both ends of each monomer in a process analogous to polypeptide
biopolymers. Most nylons are made from the reaction of a dicarboxylic_acid with
a diamine (e.g. PA66) or a lactam or amino acid with itself (e.g. PA6).[44] In
the first case, the "repeating unit" consists of one of each monomer, so that
they alternate in the chain, similar to the so-called ABAB structure of
polyesters and polyurethanes. Since each monomer in this copolymer has the same
reactive_group on both ends, the direction of the amide_bond reverses between
each monomer, unlike natural polyamide proteins, which have overall
directionality: C terminal â N terminal. In the second case (so called AA),
the repeating unit corresponds to the single monomer.[9]:45â50[45]
**** Nomenclature[edit] ****
In common usage, the prefix "PA" (polyamide) or the name "Nylon" are used
interchangeably and are equivalent in meaning.
The nomenclature used for nylon polymers was devised during the synthesis of
the first simple aliphatic nylons and uses numbers to describe the number of
carbons in each monomer unit, including the carbon(s) of the carboxylic acid
(s).[46][47] Subsequent use of cyclic and aromatic monomers required the use of
letters or sets of letters. One number after "PA" or "Nylon" indicates a
homopolymer which is monadic or based on one amino acid (minus H2O) as monomer:
      PA 6 or Nylon 6: [NHâ(CH2)5âCO]n made from Îµ-Caprolactam.
Two numbers or sets of letters indicate a dyadic homopolymer formed from two
monomers: one diamine and one dicarboxylic acid. The first number indicates the
number of carbons in the diamine. The two numbers should be separated by a
comma for clarity, but the comma is often omitted.
      PA or Nylon 6,10 (or 610) : [NHâ(CH2)6âNHâCOâ(CH2)8âCO]n made
      from hexamethylenediamine and sebacic_acid;
For copolymers the comonomers or pairs of comonomers are separated by slashes:
      PA 6/66 : [NH-(CH2)6âNHâCOâ(CH2)4âCO]nâ[NHâ(CH2)5âCO]m made
      from caprolactam, hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid ;
      PA 66/610 : [NHâ(CH2)6âNHâCOâ(CH2)4âCO]nâ[NHâ
      (CH2)6âNHâCOâ(CH2)8âCO]m made from hexamethylenediamine, adipic
      acid and sebacic acid.
The term polyphthalamide (abbreviated to PPA) is used when 60% or more moles of
the carboxylic acid portion of the repeating unit in the polymer chain is
composed of a combination of terephthalic_acid (TPA) and isophthalic_acid
(IPA).
**** Types of nylon[edit] ****
*** Nylon 66[edit] ***
Main article: Nylon_66
Wallace Carothers at DuPont patented nylon 66 using amides.[19][48][49] In the
case of nylons that involve reaction of a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid, it
is difficult to get the proportions exactly correct, and deviations can lead to
chain termination at molecular weights less than a desirable 10,000 daltons
(u). To overcome this problem, a crystalline, solid "nylon salt" can be formed
at room_temperature, using an exact 1:1 ratio of the acid and the base to
neutralize each other. The salt is crystallized to purify it and obtain the
desired precise stoichiometry. Heated to 285 Â°C (545 Â°F), the salt reacts to
form nylon polymer with the production of water.
*** Nylon 6[edit] ***
Main article: Nylon_6
The synthetic route using lactams (cyclic amides) was developed by Paul_Schlack
at IG_Farben, leading to nylon 6, or polycaprolactam â formed by a ring-
opening_polymerization. The peptide bond within the caprolactam is broken with
the exposed active_groups on each side being incorporated into two new bonds as
the monomer becomes part of the polymer backbone.
The 428 Â°F (220 Â°C) melting point of nylon 6 is lower than the 509 Â°F
(265 Â°C) melting point of nylon_66.[50]
*** Nylon 510[edit] ***
Nylon 510, made from pentamethylene_diamine and sebacic acid, was studied by
Carothers even before nylon 66 and has superior properties, but is more
expensive to make. In keeping with this naming convention, "nylon 6,12" or "PA
612" is a copolymer of a 6C diamine and a 12C diacid. Similarly for PA 510 PA
611; PA 1012, etc. Other nylons include copolymerized dicarboxylic acid/diamine
products that are not based upon the monomers listed above. For example, some
fully aromatic nylons (known as "aramids") are polymerized with the addition of
diacids like terephthalic acid (â Kevlar, Twaron) or isophthalic acid (â
Nomex), more commonly associated with polyesters. There are copolymers of PA
66/6; copolymers of PA 66/6/12; and others. In general linear polymers are the
most useful, but it is possible to introduce branches in nylon by the
condensation of dicarboxylic acids with polyamines having three or more amino
groups.
The general reaction is:
[Condensation_polymerization_diacid_diamine.svg]
Two molecules of water are given off and the nylon is formed. Its properties
are determined by the R and R' groups in the monomers. In nylon 6,6, R = 4C and
R' = 6C alkanes, but one also has to include the two carboxyl carbons in the
diacid to get the number it donates to the chain. In Kevlar, both R and R' are
benzene rings.
Industrial synthesis is usually done by heating the acids, amines or lactams to
remove water, but in the laboratory, diacid chlorides can be reacted with
diamines. For example, a popular demonstration of interfacial polymerization
(the "nylon_rope_trick") is the synthesis of nylon 66 from adipoyl_chloride and
hexamethylene diamine.
*** Nylon 1,6[edit] ***
Main article: Nylon_1,6
Nylons can also be synthesized from dinitriles using acid catalysis. For
example, this method is applicable for preparation of nylon_1,6 from
adiponitrile, formaldehyde and water.[51] Additionally, nylons can be
synthesized from diols and dinitriles using this method as well.[52]

**** Polymers[edit] ****
Due to the large number of diamines, diacids and aminoacids that can be
synthesized, many nylon polymers have been made experimentally and
characterized to varying degrees. A smaller number have been scaled up and
offered commercially, and these are detailed below.

    * PA410 DSM Ecopaxx[62]

    * PA66 DuPont Zytel[64]
*** Copolymers[edit] ***
It is easy to make mixtures of the monomers or sets of monomers used to make
nylons to obtain copolymers. This lowers crystallinity and can therefore lower
the melting point.
Some copolymers that have been or are commercially available are listed below:
    * PA6/66 DuPont Zytel[65]
    * PA6/6T BASF Ultramid T (6/6T copolymer)[66]
    * PA6I/6T DuPont Selar PA[67]
    * PA66/6T DuPont Zytel HTN[66]
    * PA12/MACMI EMS Grilamid TR[68]
*** Blends[edit] ***
Most nylon polymers are miscible with each other allowing a range of blends to
be made. The two polymers can react with one another by transamidation to form
random copolymers.[69]
According to their crystallinity, polyamides can be:
    * semi-crystalline:
          o high crystallinity: PA46 and PA66;
          o low crystallinity: PAMXD6 made from m-xylylenediamine and adipic
            acid;
    * amorphous: PA6I made from hexamethylenediamine and isophthalic acid.
According to this classification, PA66, for example, is an aliphatic semi-
crystalline homopolyamide.
**** Hydrolysis and degradation[edit] ****
All nylons are susceptible to hydrolysis, especially by strong_acids, a
reaction essentially the reverse of the synthetic reaction shown above. The
molecular_weight of nylon products so attacked drops, and cracks form quickly
at the affected zones. Lower members of the nylons (such as nylon 6) are
affected more than higher members such as nylon 12. This means that nylon parts
cannot be used in contact with sulfuric_acid for example, such as the
electrolyte used in leadâacid_batteries.
When being molded, nylon must be dried to prevent hydrolysis in the molding
machine barrel since water at high temperatures can also degrade the polymer.
[70] The reaction is of the type:
      [Amide_hydrolysis.svg]
**** Environmental impact, incineration and recycling[edit] ****
Berners-Lee calculates the average greenhouse_gas_footprint of nylon in
manufacturing carpets at 5.43 kg CO2 equivalent per kg, when produced in
Europe. This gives it almost the same carbon footprint as wool, but with
greater durability and therefore a lower overall carbon footprint.[71]
Data published by PlasticsEurope indicates for nylon 66 a greenhouse_gas
footprint of 6.4 kg CO2 equivalent per kg, and an energy consumption of 138 kJ/
kg.[72] When considering the environmental impact of nylon, it is important to
consider the use phase. In particular when cars are lightweight, significant
savings in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are achieved.
Various nylons break down in fire and form hazardous smoke, and toxic fumes or
ash, typically containing hydrogen_cyanide. Incinerating nylons to recover the
high energy used to create them is usually expensive, so most nylons reach the
garbage dumps, decaying slowly.[73] Discarded nylon fabric takes 30â40 years
to decompose.[74] Nylon is a robust polymer and lends itself well to recycling.
Much nylon resin is recycled directly in a closed loop at the injection molding
machine, by grinding sprues and runners and mixing them with the virgin
granules being consumed by the molding machine.[75] Aquafil has demonstrated
recycling fishing nets lost in the ocean into apparel [76]
***** Bulk properties[edit] *****
Above their melting_temperatures, Tm, thermoplastics like nylon are amorphous
solids or viscous fluids in which the chains approximate random_coils. Below
Tm, amorphous regions alternate with regions which are lamellar crystals.[77]
The amorphous regions contribute elasticity and the crystalline regions
contribute strength and rigidity. The planar amide (-CO-NH-) groups are very
polar, so nylon forms multiple hydrogen_bonds among adjacent strands. Because
the nylon backbone is so regular and symmetrical, especially if all the amide
bonds are in the trans_configuration, nylons often have high crystallinity and
make excellent fibers. The amount of crystallinity depends on the details of
formation, as well as on the kind of nylon.
Hydrogen bonding in Nylon 6,6 (in mauve).
Nylon 66 can have multiple parallel strands aligned with their neighboring
peptide bonds at coordinated separations of exactly 6 and 4 carbons for
considerable lengths, so the carbonyl oxygens and amide hydrogens can line up
to form interchain hydrogen bonds repeatedly, without interruption (see the
figure opposite). Nylon 510 can have coordinated runs of 5 and 8 carbons. Thus
parallel (but not antiparallel) strands can participate in extended, unbroken,
multi-chain Î²-pleated_sheets, a strong and tough supermolecular structure
similar to that found in natural silk_fibroin and the Î²-keratins in feathers.
(Proteins have only an amino acid Î±-carbon separating sequential -CO-NH-
groups.) Nylon 6 will form uninterrupted H-bonded sheets with mixed
directionalities, but the Î²-sheet wrinkling is somewhat different. The three-
dimensional disposition of each alkane hydrocarbon_chain depends on rotations
about the 109.47Â° tetrahedral bonds of singly bonded carbon atoms.
When extruded into fibers through pores in an industry spinneret, the
individual polymer chains tend to align because of viscous flow. If subjected
to cold_drawing afterwards, the fibers align further, increasing their
crystallinity, and the material acquires additional tensile_strength. In
practice, nylon fibers are most often drawn using heated rolls at high speeds.
[78]
Block nylon tends to be less crystalline, except near the surfaces due to
shearing stresses during formation. Nylon is clear and colorless, or milky, but
is easily dyed. Multistranded nylon cord and rope is slippery and tends to
unravel. The ends can be melted and fused with a heat source such as a flame or
electrode to prevent this.
Nylons are hygroscopic, and will absorb or desorb moisture as a function of the
ambient humidity. Variations in moisture content have several effects on the
polymer. Firstly, the dimensions will change, but more importantly moisture
acts as a plasticizer, lowering the glass_transition_temperature (Tg), and
consequently the elastic modulus at temperatures below the Tg[79]
When dry, polyamide is a good electrical insulator. However, polyamide is
hygroscopic. The absorption of water will change some of the material's
properties such as its electrical_resistance. Nylon is less absorbent than wool
or cotton.
**** Characteristics[edit] ****
The characteristic features of nylon 6,6 include:
    * Pleats and creases can be heat-set at higher temperatures
    * More compact molecular structure
    * Better weathering properties; better sunlight resistance
    * Softer "Hand"
    * High melting point (256 Â°C/492.8 Â°F)
    * Superior colorfastness
    * Excellent abrasion resistance
On the other hand, nylon 6 is easy to dye, more readily fades; it has a higher
impact resistance, a more rapid moisture absorption, greater elasticity and
elastic recovery.
    * Variation of luster: nylon has the ability to be very lustrous, semi-
      lustrous or dull.
    * Durability: its high tenacity fibers are used for seatbelts, tire cords,
      ballistic cloth and other uses.
    * High elongation
    * Excellent abrasion resistance
    * Highly resilient (nylon fabrics are heat-set)
    * Paved the way for easy-care garments
    * High resistance to insects, fungi, animals, as well as molds, mildew, rot
      and many chemicals
    * Used in carpets and nylon stockings
    * Melts instead of burning
    * Used in many military applications
    * Good specific_strength
    * Transparent to infrared light (â12 dB)[80][clarification_needed]
*** Flammability[edit] ***
Nylon clothing tends to be less flammable than cotton and rayon, but nylon
fibers may melt and stick to skin.[81][82]
***** Uses[edit] *****
**** Nylon fibers[edit] ****
These worn out nylon stockings will be reprocessed and made into parachutes for
army fliers c. 1942
Blue Nylon fabric ball gown by Emma Domb, Science_History_Institute
Bill_Pittendreigh, DuPont, and other individuals and corporations worked
diligently during the first few months of World War II to find a way to replace
Asian silk and hemp with nylon in parachutes. It was also used to make tires,
tents, ropes, ponchos, and other military supplies. It was even used in the
production of a high-grade paper for U.S. currency. At the outset of the war,
cotton accounted for more than 80% of all fibers used and manufactured, and
wool fibers accounted for nearly all of the rest. By August 1945, manufactured
fibers had taken a market share of 25%, at the expense of cotton. After the
war, because of shortages of both silk and nylon, nylon parachute material was
sometimes repurposed to make dresses.[83]
Nylon 6 and 66 fibers are used in carpet manufacture.
Nylon is one kind of fibers used in tire_cord. Herman_E._Schroeder pioneered
application of nylon in tires.
**** Molds and resins[edit] ****
Nylon resins are widely used in the automobile industry especially in the
engine compartment.[84][2]:514
Molded nylon is used in hair combs and mechanical parts such as machine_screws,
gears, gaskets, and other low- to medium-stress components previously cast in
metal.[85][86] Engineering-grade nylon is processed by extrusion, casting, and
injection_molding. Type 6,6 Nylon 101 is the most common commercial grade of
nylon, and Nylon 6 is the most common commercial grade of molded nylon.[87][88]
For use in tools such as spudgers, nylon is available in glass-filled_variants
which increase structural and impact strength and rigidity, and molybdenum
disulfide-filled variants which increase lubricity. Its various properties also
make it very useful as a material in additive_manufacturing; specifically as a
filament in consumer and professional grade fused_deposition_modeling 3D
printers. Nylon can be used as the matrix material in composite_materials, with
reinforcing fibers like glass or carbon fiber; such a composite has a higher
density than pure nylon.[89] Such thermoplastic composites (25% to 30% glass
fiber) are frequently used in car components next to the engine, such as intake
manifolds, where the good heat resistance of such materials makes them feasible
competitors to metals.[90]
Nylon was used to make the stock of the Remington_Nylon_66 rifle.[91] The frame
of the modern Glock pistol is made of a nylon composite.[92]
**** Food packaging[edit] ****
Nylon resins are used as a component of food packaging films where an oxygen
barrier is needed.[4] Some of the terpolymers based upon nylon are used every
day in packaging. Nylon has been used for meat wrappings and sausage sheaths.
[93] The high temperature resistance of nylon makes it useful for oven bags.
[94]
**** Filaments[edit] ****
Nylon filaments are primarily used in brushes especially toothbrushes[11] and
string_trimmers. They are also used as monofilaments in fishing_line. Nylon 610
and 612 are the most used polymers for filaments.
Its various properties also make it very useful as a material in additive
manufacturing; specifically as a filament in consumer and professional grade
fused_deposition_modeling 3D printers.
**** Other forms[edit] ****
*** Extruded Profiles[edit] ***
Nylon resins can be extruded into rods, tubes and sheets.[2]:209
*** Powder Coating[edit] ***
Nylon powders are used to powder coat metals. Nylon_11 and nylon 12 are the
most widely used.[2]:53
*** Instrument strings[edit] ***
In the mid-1940s, classical guitarist AndrÃ©s_Segovia mentioned the shortage of
good guitar strings in the United States, particularly his favorite Pirastro
catgut strings, to a number of foreign diplomats at a party, including General
Lindeman of the British Embassy. A month later, the General presented Segovia
with some nylon strings which he had obtained via some members of the DuPont
family. Segovia found that although the strings produced a clear sound, they
had a faint metallic timbre which he hoped could be eliminated.[95]
Nylon strings were first tried on stage by Olga Coelho in New York in January,
1944.[96]
In 1946, Segovia and string maker Albert_Augustine were introduced by their
mutual friend Vladimir Bobri, editor of Guitar Review. On the basis of
Segovia's interest and Augustine's past experiments, they decided to pursue the
development of nylon strings. DuPont, skeptical of the idea, agreed to supply
the nylon if Augustine would endeavor to develop and produce the actual
strings. After three years of development, Augustine demonstrated a nylon first
string whose quality impressed guitarists, including Segovia, in addition to
DuPont.[95]
Wound strings, however, were more problematic. Eventually, however, after
experimenting with various types of metal and smoothing and polishing
techniques, Augustine was also able to produce high quality nylon wound
strings.[95]
***** Caring for nylon[edit] *****
**** Washing[edit] ****
While nylon fabric is washable, with the use of any household soap or
detergent, reference instructions from the manufacturer concerning whether to
wash or dry clean the product. Dyes, finishes, and trims added to the fabric
may not be machine washable. Delicate articles should always be hand washed.
Due to discoloration of the fabric, white nylon items should be washed
separately from colors. [97]
**** Bleaching[edit] ****
Bleaching can damage nylon articles and therefore should only be used sparingly
on stains that cannot be removed by a regular wash. [97]
**** Drying[edit] ****
Begin by rinsing with warm water and smooth by hand. Product can either hang to
dry after squeezing moisture out or hang dripping wet. Though nylon articles
can dry indoors or outdoors, it is important to keep colored nylon out of too
much direct sunlight. The colors can fade after time.[97]
**** Ironing[edit] ****
When hung to dry, many nylon garments need little to no ironing. If needed, use
the iron at around 250Â° with the article being either damp or dry. A
temperature higher than that will cause damage and may melt the plastic-like
material. Using a steamer is also acceptable.[97]
