Biotechnology (commonly abbreviated as biotech) is the broad area of biology
involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or "any
technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or
derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use"
(UN Convention_on_Biological_Diversity, Art. 2).[1] Depending on the tools and
applications, it often overlaps with the (related) fields of molecular_biology,
bio-engineering, biomedical_engineering, biomanufacturing, molecular
engineering, etc.
For thousands of years, humankind has used biotechnology in agriculture, food
production, and medicine.[2] The term is largely believed to have been coined
in 1919 by Hungarian engineer KÃ¡roly_Ereky. In the late 20th and early 21st
centuries, biotechnology has expanded to include new and diverse sciences such
as genomics, recombinant_gene techniques, applied immunology, and development
of pharmaceutical therapies and diagnostic_tests.[2]

***** Definitions[edit] *****
The wide concept of "biotech" or "biotechnology" encompasses a wide range of
procedures for modifying living organisms according to human purposes, going
back to domestication of animals, cultivation of the plants, and "improvements"
to these through breeding programs that employ artificial_selection and
hybridization. Modern usage also includes genetic_engineering as well as cell
and tissue_culture technologies. The American_Chemical_Society defines
biotechnology as the application of biological organisms, systems, or processes
by various industries to learning about the science of life and the improvement
of the value of materials and organisms such as pharmaceuticals, crops, and
livestock.[3] Per the European_Federation_of_Biotechnology, biotechnology is
the integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and
molecular analogues for products and services.[4] Biotechnology is based on the
basic biological_sciences (e.g. molecular_biology, biochemistry, cell_biology,
embryology, genetics, microbiology) and conversely provides methods to support
and perform basic research in biology.
Biotechnology is the research_and_development in the laboratory using
bioinformatics for exploration, extraction, exploitation and production from
any living_organisms and any source of biomass by means of biochemical
engineering where high value-added products could be planned (reproduced by
biosynthesis, for example), forecasted, formulated, developed, manufactured,
and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations (for the return from
bottomless initial investment on R & D) and gaining durable patents rights (for
exclusives rights for sales, and prior to this to receive national and
international approval from the results on animal experiment and human
experiment, especially on the pharmaceutical branch of biotechnology to prevent
any undetected side-effects or safety concerns by using the products).[5][6][7]
The utilization of biological processes, organisms or systems to produce
products that are anticipated to improve human lives is termed biotechnology.
[8]
By contrast, bioengineering is generally thought of as a related field that
more heavily emphasizes higher systems approaches (not necessarily the altering
or using of biological materials directly) for interfacing with and utilizing
living things. Bioengineering is the application of the principles of
engineering and natural sciences to tissues, cells and molecules. This can be
considered as the use of knowledge from working with and manipulating biology
to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and animals.[9]
Relatedly, biomedical_engineering is an overlapping field that often draws upon
and applies biotechnology (by various definitions), especially in certain sub-
fields of biomedical or chemical_engineering such as tissue_engineering,
biopharmaceutical_engineering, and genetic_engineering.
***** History[edit] *****
Brewing was an early application of biotechnology
Main article: History_of_biotechnology
Although not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human-derived
agriculture clearly fit the broad definition of "'utilizing a biotechnological
system to make products". Indeed, the cultivation of plants may be viewed as
the earliest biotechnological enterprise.
Agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing
food since the Neolithic_Revolution. Through early biotechnology, the earliest
farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to
produce enough food to support a growing population. As crops and fields became
increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific
organisms and their by-products could effectively fertilize, restore_nitrogen,
and control_pests. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have
inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to
new environments and breeding them with other plants â one of the first forms
of biotechnology.
These processes also were included in early fermentation of beer.[10] These
processes were introduced in early Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India, and
still use the same basic biological methods. In brewing, malted grains
(containing enzymes) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding
specific yeasts to produce beer. In this process, carbohydrates in the grains
broke down into alcohols, such as ethanol. Later, other cultures produced the
process of lactic_acid_fermentation, which produced other preserved foods, such
as soy_sauce. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce
leavened_bread. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood
until Louis_Pasteur's work in 1857, it is still the first use of biotechnology
to convert a food source into another form.
Before the time of Charles_Darwin's work and life, animal and plant scientists
had already used selective breeding. Darwin added to that body of work with his
scientific observations about the ability of science to change species. These
accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection.[11]
For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve
production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding,
organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with
the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to
produce the largest and sweetest crops.[12]
In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of
microbiology and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917,
Chaim_Weizmann first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial
process, that of manufacturing corn_starch using Clostridium_acetobutylicum, to
produce acetone, which the United_Kingdom desperately needed to manufacture
explosives during World_War_I.[13]
Biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928,
Alexander_Fleming discovered the mold Penicillium. His work led to the
purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey,
Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley â to form what we today know as
penicillin. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat
bacterial infections in humans.[12]
The field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born
in 1971 when Paul Berg's (Stanford) experiments in gene splicing had early
success. Herbert_W._Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley_N._Cohen
(Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring
genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be
reproduced. The commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was
significantly expanded on June 16, 1980, when the United_States_Supreme_Court
ruled that a genetically_modified microorganism could be patented in the case
of Diamond_v._Chakrabarty.[14] Indian-born Ananda_Chakrabarty, working for
General_Electric, had modified a bacterium (of the genus Pseudomonas) capable
of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills.
(Chakrabarty's work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer
of entire organelles between strains of the Pseudomonas bacterium.
Revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 12.9% in 2008.

[Ambox current red.svg] article to reflect recent events or newly available
                        information. (October 2018)
Another factor influencing the biotechnology sector's success is improved
intellectual property rights legislationâand enforcementâworldwide, as well
as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an
ageing, and ailing, U.S. population.[15]
Rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology
sector, with the Department_of_Energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce
U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology
sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of
corn and soybeansâthe main inputs into biofuelsâby developing genetically
modified seeds that resist pests and drought. By increasing farm productivity,
biotechnology boosts biofuel production.[16]
***** Examples[edit] *****

Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health
care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non-food (industrial) uses of
crops and other products (e.g. biodegradable_plastics, vegetable_oil, biofuels,
and environmental uses).
For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of
microorganisms for the manufacture of organic products (examples include beer
and milk products). Another example is using naturally present bacteria by the
mining industry in bioleaching. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat
waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities (bioremediation),
and also to produce biological_weapons.
A series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of
biotechnology, for example:
    * Bioinformatics (also called "gold biotechnology") is an interdisciplinary
      field that addresses biological problems using computational techniques,
      and makes the rapid organization as well as analysis of biological data
      possible. The field may also be referred to as computational biology, and
      can be defined as, "conceptualizing biology in terms of molecules and
      then applying informatics techniques to understand and organize the
      information associated with these molecules, on a large scale."[17]
      Bioinformatics plays a key role in various areas, such as functional
      genomics, structural_genomics, and proteomics, and forms a key component
      in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector.[18]
    * Blue biotechnology is based on the exploitation of sea resources to
      create products and industrial applications.[19] This branch of
      biotechnology is the most used for the industries of refining and
      combustion principally on the production of bio-oils with photosynthetic
      micro-algae.[19][20]
    * Green biotechnology is biotechnology applied to agricultural processes.
      An example would be the selection and domestication of plants via
      micropropagation. Another example is the designing of transgenic_plants
      to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of
      chemicals. One hope is that green biotechnology might produce more
      environmentally friendly solutions than traditional industrial
      agriculture. An example of this is the engineering of a plant to express
      a pesticide, thereby ending the need of external application of
      pesticides. An example of this would be Bt_corn. Whether or not green
      biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally
      friendly is a topic of considerable debate.[19] It is commonly considered
      as the next phase of green revolution, which can be seen as a platform to
      eradicate world hunger by using technologies which enable the production
      of more fertile and resistant, towards biotic and abiotic_stress, plants
      and ensures application of environmentally friendly fertilizers and the
      use of biopesticides, it is mainly focused on the development of
      agriculture.[19] On the other hand, some of the uses of green
      biotechnology involve microorganisms to clean and reduce waste.[21][19]
    * Red biotechnology is the use of biotechnology in the medical and
      pharmaceutical industries, and health preservation.[19] This branch
      involves the production of vaccines and antibiotics, regenerative
      therapies, creation of artificial organs and new diagnostics of diseases.
      [19] As well as the development of hormones, stem_cells, antibodies,
      siRNA and diagnostic_tests.[19]
    * White biotechnology, also known as industrial biotechnology, is
      biotechnology applied to industrial processes. An example is the
      designing of an organism to produce a useful chemical. Another example is
      the using of enzymes as industrial catalysts to either produce valuable
      chemicals or destroy hazardous/polluting chemicals. White biotechnology
      tends to consume less in resources than traditional processes used to
      produce industrial goods.[22][23]
    * "Yellow biotechnology" refers to the use of biotechnology in food
      production, for example in making wine, cheese, and beer by fermentation.
      [19] It has also been used to refer to biotechnology applied to insects.
      This includes biotechnology-based approaches for the control of harmful
      insects, the characterisation and utilisation of active ingredients or
      genes of insects for research, or application in agriculture and medicine
      and various other approaches.[24]
    * Gray biotechnology is dedicated to environmental applications, and
      focused on the maintenance of biodiversity and the remotion of
      pollutants.[19]
    * Brown biotechnology is related to the management of arid lands and
      deserts. One application is the creation of enhanced seeds that resist
      extreme environmental_conditions of arid regions, which is related to the
      innovation, creation of agriculture techniques and management of
      resources.[19]
    * Violet biotechnology is related to law, ethical and philosophical issues
      around biotechnology.[19]
    * Dark biotechnology is the color associated with bioterrorism or
      biological_weapons and biowarfare which uses microorganisms, and toxins
      to cause diseases and death in humans, livestock and crops.[25][19]
**** Medicine[edit] ****
In medicine, modern biotechnology has many applications in areas such as
pharmaceutical_drug discoveries and production, pharmacogenomics, and genetic
testing (or genetic_screening).
DNA_microarray chip â some can do as many as a million blood tests at once
Pharmacogenomics (a combination of pharmacology and genomics) is the technology
that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual's response to drugs.[26]
Researchers in the field investigate the influence of genetic variation on drug
responses in patients by correlating gene_expression or single-nucleotide
polymorphisms with a drug's efficacy or toxicity.[27] The purpose of
pharmacogenomics is to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with
respect to the patients' genotype, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal
adverse_effects.[28] Such approaches promise the advent of "personalized
medicine"; in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each
individual's unique genetic makeup.[29][30]

symmetry, the zinc ions holding it together, and the histidine residues
involved in zinc binding.
Biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional
small_molecule pharmaceutical_drugs as well as drugs that are the product of
biotechnology â biopharmaceutics. Modern biotechnology can be used to
manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first
genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human
diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 Genentech developed synthetic humanized
insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium
Escherichia_coli. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was
previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals (cattle or pigs).
The genetically engineered bacteria are able to produce large quantities of
synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost.[31][32] Biotechnology has also
enabled emerging therapeutics like gene_therapy. The application of
biotechnology to basic science (for example through the Human_Genome_Project)
has also dramatically improved our understanding of biology and as our
scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased, our ability
to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased
as well.[32]
Genetic_testing allows the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited
diseases, and can also be used to determine a child's parentage (genetic mother
and father) or in general a person's ancestry. In addition to studying
chromosomes to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader
sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases,
or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic
disorders. Genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or
proteins.[33] Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are
associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm
or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance
of developing or passing on a genetic_disorder. As of 2011 several hundred
genetic tests were in use.[34][35] Since genetic testing may open up ethical or
psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic
counseling.
**** Agriculture[edit] ****
Genetically_modified_crops ("GM crops", or "biotech crops") are plants used in
agriculture, the DNA of which has been modified with genetic_engineering
techniques. In most cases, the main aim is to introduce a new trait that does
not occur naturally in the species. Biotechnology firms can contribute to
future food security by improving the nutrition and viability of urban
agriculture. Furthermore, the protection of intellectual property rights
encourages private sector investment in agrobiotechnology. For example, in
Illinois FARM Illinois (Food and Agriculture RoadMap for Illinois) is an
initiative to develop and coordinate farmers, industry, research institutions,
government, and nonprofits in pursuit of food and agriculture innovation. In
addition, the Illinois Biotechnology Industry Organization (iBIO) is a life
sciences industry association with more than 500 life sciences companies,
universities, academic institutions, service providers and others as members.
The association describes its members as "dedicated to making Illinois and the
surrounding Midwest one of the worldâs top life sciences centers."[36]
Examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests,[37] diseases,[38]
stressful environmental conditions,[39] resistance to chemical treatments (e.g.
resistance to a herbicide[40]), reduction of spoilage,[41] or improving the
nutrient profile of the crop.[42] Examples in non-food crops include production
of pharmaceutical_agents,[43] biofuels,[44] and other industrially useful
goods,[45] as well as for bioremediation.[46][47]
Farmers have widely adopted GM technology. Between 1996 and 2011, the total
surface area of land cultivated with GM crops had increased by a factor of 94,
from 17,000 square kilometers (4,200,000 acres) to 1,600,000 km2 (395 million
acres).[48] 10% of the world's crop lands were planted with GM crops in 2010.
[48] As of 2011, 11 different transgenic crops were grown commercially on 395
million acres (160 million hectares) in 29 countries such as the US, Brazil,
Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay, Pakistan, South Africa, Uruguay,
Bolivia, Australia, Philippines, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Mexico and Spain.[48]
Genetically_modified_foods are foods produced from organisms that have had
specific changes introduced into their DNA with the methods of genetic
engineering. These techniques have allowed for the introduction of new crop
traits as well as a far greater control over a food's genetic structure than
previously afforded by methods such as selective_breeding and mutation
breeding.[49] Commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994, when
Calgene first marketed its Flavr_Savr delayed ripening tomato.[50] To date most
genetic modification of foods have primarily focused on cash_crops in high
demand by farmers such as soybean, corn, canola, and cotton_seed_oil. These
have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and better
nutrient profiles. GM livestock have also been experimentally developed; in
November 2013 none were available on the market,[51] but in 2015 the FDA
approved the first GM salmon for commercial production and consumption.[52]
There is a scientific_consensus[53][54][55][56][57][58][59] that currently
available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than
conventional food,[60][61][62][63][64][65][66] but that each GM food must be
tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction.[67][68][69] Nonetheless,
members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods
as safe.[70][71][72][73] The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by
country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting
them with widely differing degrees of regulation.[74][75][76][77]
GM crops also provide a number of ecological benefits, if not used in excess.
[78] However, opponents have objected to GM crops per se on several grounds,
including environmental concerns, whether food produced from GM crops is safe,
whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs, and economic
concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to intellectual
property law.
**** Industrial[edit] ****
Industrial biotechnology (known mainly in Europe as white biotechnology) is the
application of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including industrial
fermentation. It includes the practice of using cells such as microorganisms,
or components of cells like enzymes, to generate industrially useful products
in sectors such as chemicals, food and feed, detergents, paper and pulp,
textiles and biofuels.[79] In the current decades, significant progress has
been done in creating genetically_modified_organisms_(GMOs) that enhance the
diversity of applications and economical viability of industrial biotechnology.
By using renewable raw materials to produce a variety of chemicals and fuels,
industrial biotechnology is actively advancing towards lowering greenhouse gas
emissions and moving away from a petrochemical-based economy.[80]
**** Environmental[edit] ****
The environment can be affected by biotechnologies, both positively and
adversely. Vallero and others have argued that the difference between
beneficial biotechnology (e.g.bioremediation is to clean up an oil spill or
hazard chemical leak) versus the adverse effects stemming from biotechnological
enterprises (e.g. flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild
strains) can be seen as applications and implications, respectively.[81]
Cleaning up environmental wastes is an example of an application of
environmental biotechnology; whereas loss_of_biodiversity or loss of
containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of
biotechnology.
**** Regulation[edit] ****
Main articles: Regulation_of_genetic_engineering and Regulation_of_the_release
of_genetic_modified_organisms
The regulation of genetic engineering concerns approaches taken by governments
to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of genetic_engineering
technology, and the development and release of genetically modified organisms
(GMO), including genetically_modified_crops and genetically_modified_fish.
There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of
the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.[82]
Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the
products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food
use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.[83]
The European Union differentiates between approval for cultivation within the
EU and approval for import and processing. While only a few GMOs have been
approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for
import and processing.[84] The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about
coexistence of GM and non GM crops. Depending on the coexistence regulations,
incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ.[85]
***** Learning[edit] *****
In 1988, after prompting from the United_States_Congress, the National
Institute_of_General_Medical_Sciences (National_Institutes_of_Health) (NIGMS)
instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training. Universities
nationwide compete for these funds to establish Biotechnology Training Programs
(BTPs). Each successful application is generally funded for five years then
must be competitively renewed. Graduate_students in turn compete for acceptance
into a BTP; if accepted, then stipend, tuition and health insurance support is
provided for two or three years during the course of their Ph.D. thesis work.
Nineteen institutions offer NIGMS supported BTPs.[86] Biotechnology training is
also offered at the undergraduate level and in community colleges.
