Packaging is the science, art and technology of enclosing or protecting
products for distribution, storage, sale, and use. Packaging also refers to the
process of designing, evaluating, and producing packages. Packaging can be
described as a coordinated system of preparing goods for transport,
warehousing, logistics, sale, and end use. Packaging contains, protects,
preserves, transports, informs, and sells.[1] In many countries it is fully
integrated into government, business, institutional, industrial, and personal
use.
Package labeling (American_English) or labelling (British_English) is any
written, electronic, or graphic_communication on the package or on a separate
but associated label.

***** History of packaging[edit] *****
**** Ancient era[edit] ****
Bronze wine container from the 9th century BCE.
The first packages used the natural materials available at the time: baskets of
reeds, wineskins (bota_bags), wooden_boxes, pottery vases, ceramic amphorae,
wooden barrels, woven bags, etc. Processed materials were used to form packages
as they were developed: for example, early glass and bronze vessels. The study
of old packages is an important aspect of archaeology.
The earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035, when a
Persian traveler visiting markets in Cairo, Arab_Egypt, noted that vegetables,
spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were
sold.[2]
**** Modern era[edit] ****
*** Tinning[edit] ***
The use of tinplate for packaging dates back to the 18th century. The
manufacturing of tinplate was the monopoly of Bohemia for a long time; in 1667
Andrew_Yarranton, an English engineer, and Ambrose_Crowley brought the method
to England where it was improved by ironmasters including Philip_Foley.[3][4]
By 1697, John_Hanbury[5] had a rolling mill at Pontypool for making "Pontypoole
Plates".[6][7] The method pioneered there of rolling iron plates by means of
cylinders enabled more uniform black plates to be produced than was possible
with the former practice of hammering.
Tinplate boxes first began to be sold from ports in the Bristol_Channel in
1725. The tinplate was shipped from Newport,_Monmouthshire.[8] By 1805, 80,000
boxes were made and 50,000 exported. Tobacconists in London began packaging
snuff in metal-plated canisters from the 1760s onwards.
*** Canning[edit] ***
1914 magazine advertisement for cookware with instructions for home canning.
With the discovery of the importance of airtight containers for food
preservation by French inventor Nicholas_Appert, the tin canning process was
patented by British merchant Peter_Durand in 1810.[9] After receiving the
patent, Durand did not himself follow up with canning food. He sold his patent
in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan_Donkin and John Hall, who refined the
process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on
Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned
goods for the Royal_Navy.[10]
The progressive improvement in canning stimulated the 1855 invention of the can
opener. Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar
Place West, Hackney Road, Middlesex, UK, devised a claw-ended can opener with a
hand-operated tool that haggled its way around the top of metal cans.[11] In
1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the
United States by Ezra_Warner of Waterbury,_Connecticut.
*** Paper-based packaging[edit] ***
Packing folding cartons of salt.
Set-up boxes were first used in the 16th century and modern folding_cartons
date back to 1839. The first corrugated_box was produced commercially in 1817
in England. Corrugated_(also_called_pleated)_paper received a British patent in
1856 and was used as a liner for tall hats. Scottish-born Robert_Gair invented
the pre-cut paperboard box in 1890âflat pieces manufactured in bulk that
folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about as a result of an accident: as a
Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an
order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, normally used to crease bags, shifted
in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one
operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes.[12]
Commercial paper bags were first manufactured in Bristol, England, in 1844, and
the American Francis_Wolle patented a machine for automated bag-making in 1852.
**** 20th century[edit] ****
Packaging advancements in the early 20th century included Bakelite closures on
bottles, transparent cellophane overwraps and panels on cartons. These
innovations increased processing efficiency and improved food_safety. As
additional materials such as aluminum and several types_of_plastic were
developed, they were incorporated into packages to improve performance and
functionality.[13]

In 1952, Michigan_State_University became the first university in the world to
offer a degree in Packaging_Engineering.[14]
In-plant recycling has long been common for producing packaging materials.
Post-consumer recycling of aluminum and paper-based products has been
economical for many years: since the 1980s, post-consumer recycling has
increased due to curbside_recycling, consumer awareness, and regulatory
pressure.

Many prominent innovations in the packaging industry were developed first for
military use. Some military supplies are packaged in the same commercial
packaging used for general industry. Other military packaging must transport
materiel, supplies, foods, etc. under severe distribution and storage
conditions. Packaging problems encountered in World_War_II led to Military
Standard or "mil spec" regulations being applied to packaging, which was then
designated "military specification packaging". As a prominent concept in the
military, mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941, due to
operations_in_Iceland experiencing critical losses, ultimately attributed to
bad packaging. In most cases, mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier
materials, field_rations, antistatic_bags, and various shipping_crates) are
similar to commercial grade packaging materials, but subject to more stringent
performance and quality requirements.[15]
As of 2003[update], the packaging sector accounted for about two percent of the
gross_national_product in developed_countries. About half of this market was
related to food_packaging.[16]
***** The purposes of packaging and package labels[edit] *****
Packaging and package labeling have several objectives[17]
    * Physical protection â The objects enclosed in the package may require
      protection from, among other things, mechanical shock, vibration,
      electrostatic_discharge, compression, temperature,[18] etc.
    * Barrier protection â A barrier to oxygen, water_vapor, dust, etc., is
      often required. Permeation is a critical factor in design. Some packages
      contain desiccants or oxygen_absorbers to help extend shelf life.
      Modified_atmospheres[19] or controlled atmospheres are also maintained in
      some food packages. Keeping the contents clean, fresh, sterile[20] and
      safe for the duration of the intended shelf_life is a primary function. A
      barrier is also implemented in cases where segregation of two materials
      prior to end use is required, as in the case of special paints, glues,
      medical fluids, etc.
    * Containment or agglomeration â Small objects are typically grouped
      together in one package for reasons of storage and selling efficiency.
      For example, a single box of 1000 pencils requires less physical handling
      than 1000 single pencils. Liquids, powders, and granular_materials need
      containment.
    * Information transmission â Packages and labels communicate how to use,
      transport, recycle, or dispose of the package or product. With
      pharmaceuticals, food, medical, and chemical products, some types of
      information are required by government legislation. Some packages and
      labels also are used for track_and_trace purposes. Most items include
      their serial and lot_numbers on the packaging, and in the case of food
      products, medicine, and some chemicals the packaging often contains an
      expiry/best-before_date, usually in a shorthand form. Packages may
      indicate their construction material with a symbol.
    * Marketing â Packaging and labels can be used by marketers to encourage
      potential buyers to purchase a product. Package graphic_design and
      physical design have been important and constantly evolving phenomena for
      several decades. Marketing_communications and graphic_design are applied
      to the surface of the package and often to the point_of_sale_display.
      Most packaging is designed to reflect the brand's message and identity.

    * Security â Packaging can play an important role in reducing the
      security risks of shipment. Packages can be made with improved tamper
      resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper-evident
      [21] features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be
      engineered to help reduce the risks of package_pilferage or the theft and
      resale of products: Some package constructions are more resistant to
      pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals.
      Counterfeit_consumer_goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material
      substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such
      anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication
      seals and use security_printing to help indicate that the package and
      contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include anti-theft
      devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic_article_surveillance
      [22] tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and
      require specialized tools to deactivate. Using packaging in this way is a
      means of retail_loss_prevention.
    * Convenience â Packages can have features that add convenience in
      distribution, handling, stacking, display, sale, opening, reclosing,
      using, dispensing, reusing, recycling, and ease of disposal
    * Portion control â Single serving or single dosage packaging has a
      precise amount of contents to control usage. Bulk commodities (such as
      salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for
      individual households. It also aids the control of inventory: selling
      sealed one-liter bottles of milk, rather than having people bring their
      own bottles to fill themselves.
    * Branding/Positioning - Packaging and labels are increasingly used to go
      beyond marketing to brand positioning, with the materials used and design
      chosen key to the storytelling element of brand development.
***** Packaging types[edit] *****
Various types of household packaging for foods
Packaging may be of several different types. For example, a transport package
or distribution package can be the shipping_container used to ship, store, and
handle the product or inner packages. Some identify a consumer package as one
which is directed toward a consumer or household.
Custom packaging is an evolutionary use of modern materials. Thermoforming and
vacuum forming allow for expanded capabilities for large trays, displays, and
specialty needs. Thermoforming is a method which uses vacuum, heat, and
pressure to form the desired material into a shape determined by its mold. This
type of packaging is often used by the cosmetic and medical industry.[citation
needed]
Packaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged:
medical_device packaging, bulk chemical packaging, over-the-counter_drug
packaging, retail food packaging, military materiel packaging, pharmaceutical
packaging, etc.
It is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function:
"primary", "secondary", etc.
    * Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and
      holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is
      the package which is in direct contact with the contents.
    * Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging, and may be used to
      prevent pilferage or to group primary packages together.
    * Tertiary or transit packaging is used for bulk_handling, warehouse
      storage and transport shipping. The most common form is a palletized unit
      load that packs tightly into containers.
These broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary. For example, depending on the
use, a shrink_wrap can be primary packaging when applied directly to the
product, secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages, or tertiary
packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution, such as to affix
a number of cartons on a pallet.
***** Symbols used on packages and labels[edit] *****

Many types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally
standardized. For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications
(such as the FCC and TÃV marks), trademarks, proof_of_purchase, etc. Some
requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and
safety, for example the CE_marking or the estimated_sign that notes conformance
to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations. Examples of environmental and
recycling symbols include the recycling_symbol, the recycling_code (which could
be a resin_identification_code), and the "Green_Dot". Food packaging may show
food_contact_material symbols. In the European_Union, products of animal origin
which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard, oval-shaped
EC_identification_and_health_marks for food safety and quality insurance
reasons.
Bar_codes, Universal_Product_Codes, and RFID labels are common to allow
automated information management in logistics and retailing. Country-of-origin
labeling is often used. Some products might use QR_codes or similar matrix
barcodes. Packaging may have visible registration_marks and other printing
calibration and troubleshooting cues.
**** Shipping container labeling[edit] ****

Technologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, bar
codes, and electronic data interchange (EDI). These three core technologies
serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers
throughout the distribution channel. Each has an essential function:
identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to
other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and
other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution
channel.
Elements of these core technologies include UPC and EAN item identification
codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping
Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated GS1-128)
bar code symbologies, and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.
Small parcel carriers often have their own formats. For example, United_Parcel
Service has a MaxiCode 2-D code for parcel tracking.
RFID labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used. A Wal-Mart
division, Sam's_Club, has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure
on its suppliers to comply.[23]
Shipments of hazardous_materials or dangerous_goods have special information
and symbols (labels, placards, etc.) as required by UN, country, and specific
carrier requirements. On transport packages, standardized symbols are also used
to communicate handling needs. Some are defined in the ASTM D5445 "Standard
Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods" and ISO 780 "Pictorial
marking for handling of goods".

***** Package development considerations[edit] *****
Package design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the
new_product_development process. Alternatively, development of a package (or
component) can be a separate process, but must be linked closely with the
product to be packaged. Package design starts with the identification of all
the requirements: structural design, marketing, shelf_life, quality_assurance,
logistics, legal, regulatory, graphic_design, end-use, environmental, etc. The
design criteria, performance (specified by package_testing), completion time
targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed
upon. Package design processes often employ rapid_prototyping, computer-aided
design, computer-aided_manufacturing and document_automation.
Transport packaging needs to be matched to its logistics system. Packages
designed for controlled shipments of uniform pallet loads may not be suited to
mixed shipments with express carriers.
An example of how package design is affected by other factors is its
relationship to logistics. When the distribution system includes individual
shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking
make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport
package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized unit_loads, the
structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs,
such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame. A package designed for one
mode of shipment may not be suited to another.
With some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory
requirements for the packaging. For example, any package components that may
contact foods are designated food_contact_materials.[24] Toxicologists and food
scientists need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by
applicable regulations. Packaging_engineers need to verify that the completed
package will keep the product safe for its intended shelf_life with normal
usage. Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be
validated to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being
of the consumer in mind.
Sometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory. For
example, regulations for an over-the-counter_drug might require the package to
be tamper-evident and child_resistant:[25] These intentionally make the package
difficult to open.[26] The intended consumer, however, might be handicapped or
elderly and unable to readily open the package. Meeting all goals is a
challenge.
Package design may take place within a company or with various degrees of
external packaging_engineering: independent_contractors, consultants, vendor
evaluations, independent laboratories, contract packagers, total outsourcing,
etc. Some sort of formal project_planning and project_management methodology is
required for all but the simplest package design and development programs. An
effective quality_management system and Verification_and_Validation protocols
are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all.
**** Environmental considerations[edit] ****
The waste_hierarchy
Main articles: Packaging_waste and sustainable_packaging
Package development involves considerations of sustainability, environmental
responsibility, and applicable environmental and recycling regulations. It may
involve a life_cycle_assessment[27][28] which considers the material and energy
inputs and outputs to the package, the packaged product (contents), the
packaging process, the logistics system,[29] waste_management, etc. It is
necessary to know the relevant regulatory requirements for point of
manufacture, sale, and use.
The traditional âthree Râsâ of reduce, reuse, and recycle are part of a
waste_hierarchy which may be considered in product and package development.
    * Prevention â Waste_prevention is a primary goal. Packaging should be
      used only where needed. Proper packaging can also help prevent waste.
      Packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the
      packaged product (contents). Usually, the energy content and material
      usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the
      package. A vital function of the package is to protect the product for
      its intended use: if the product is damaged or degraded, its entire
      energy and material content may be lost.
    * Minimization (also "source reduction") â The mass and volume of
      packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as criteria for
      minimizing the package in the design process. Usually âreducedâ
      packaging also helps minimize costs. Packaging engineers continue to work
      toward reduced packaging.[30]
    * Reuse â Reusable_packaging is encouraged.[31] Returnable packaging has
      long been useful (and economically viable) for closed loop logistics
      systems. Inspection, cleaning, repair and recouperage are often needed.
      Some manufacturers re-use the packaging of the incoming parts for a
      product, either as packaging for the outgoing product[32] or as part of
      the product itself.[33]
    * Recycling â Recycling is the reprocessing of materials (pre- and post-
      consumer) into new products. Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest
      primary components of a package: steel, aluminum, papers, plastics, etc.
      Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do
      not contaminate recycling operations. Packages can sometimes be designed
      to separate components to better facilitate recycling.
    * Energy_recovery â Waste-to-energy and Refuse-derived_fuel in approved
      facilities make use of the heat available from incinerating the packaging
      components.
    * Disposal â Incineration, and placement in a sanitary landfill are
      undertaken for some materials. Certain US states regulate packages for
      toxic contents, which have the potential to contaminate emissions and ash
      from incineration and leachate from landfill. Packages should not be
      littered.
Development of sustainable_packaging is an area of considerable interest to
standards_organizations, governments, consumers, packagers, and retailers.
Sustainability is the fastest-growing driver for packaging development,
particularly for packaging manufacturers that work with the world's leading
brands, as their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) targets often exceed
those of the EU Directive.
***** Packaging machinery[edit] *****
Main article: Packaging_machinery
Beer bottling_lines
Choosing packaging machinery includes an assessment of technical capabilities,
labor requirements, worker safety, maintainability, serviceability,
reliability, ability to integrate into the packaging line, capital cost,
floorspace, flexibility (change-over, materials, multiple products, etc.),
energy requirements, quality of outgoing packages, qualifications (for food,
pharmaceuticals, etc.), throughput, efficiency, productivity, ergonomics,
return_on_investment, etc.
Packaging machinery can be:
   1. purchased as standard, off-the-shelf equipment
   2. purchased custom-made or custom-tailored to specific operations
   3. manufactured or modified by in-house engineers and maintenance staff
Efforts at packaging line automation increasingly use programmable_logic
controllers and robotics.
Packaging machines may be of the following general types:
