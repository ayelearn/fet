Nucleic acids RNA (left) and DNA (right).
Nucleic acids are the biopolymers, or small biomolecules, essential to all
known forms of life. The term nucleic acid is the overall name for DNA and RNA.
They are composed of nucleotides, which are the monomers made of three
components: a 5-carbon_sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous_base. If the
sugar is a compound ribose, the polymer is RNA (ribonucleic acid); if the sugar
is derived from ribose as deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid).
Nucleic acids are the most important of all biomolecules. They are found in
abundance in all living things, where they function to create and encode and
then store information in the nucleus of every living cell of every life-form
organism on Earth. In turn, they function to transmit and express that
information inside and outside the cell nucleusâto the interior operations of
the cell and ultimately to the next generation of each living organism. The
encoded information is contained and conveyed via the nucleic_acid_sequence,
which provides the 'ladder-step' ordering of nucleotides within the molecules
of RNA and DNA.
Strings of nucleotides are bonded to form helical backbonesâtypically, one
for RNA, two for DNAâand assembled into chains of base-pairs selected from
the five primary,_or_canonical,_nucleobases, which are: adenine, cytosine,
guanine, thymine, and uracil. Thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil only in
RNA. Using amino acids and the process known as protein_synthesis,[1] the
specific sequencing in DNA of these nucleobase-pairs enables storing and
transmitting coded instructions as genes. In RNA, base-pair sequencing provides
for manufacturing new proteins that determine the frames and parts and most
chemical processes of all life forms.

***** History[edit] *****
The Swiss scientist Friedrich_Miescher discovered nucleic acids (DNA) in 1878.
[notes_1] Later, he raised the idea that they could be involved in heredity.[2]
    * Nuclein were discovered by Friedrich_Miescher in 1869.[3]
    * In the early 1880s Albrecht_Kossel further purifies the substance and
      discovers its highly acidic properties. He later also identifies the
      nucleobases.
    * In 1889 Richard_Altmann creates the term nucleic acid
    * In 1938 Astbury and Bell published the first X-ray diffraction pattern of
      DNA.[4]
    * In 1953 Watson and Crick determined the structure_of_DNA.[5]
Experimental studies of nucleic acids constitute a major part of modern
biological and medical_research, and form a foundation for genome and forensic
science, and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical_industries.[6][7][8]
***** Occurrence and nomenclature[edit] *****
The term nucleic acid is the overall name for DNA and RNA, members of a family
of biopolymers,[9] and is synonymous with polynucleotide. Nucleic acids were
named for their initial discovery within the nucleus, and for the presence of
phosphate groups (related to phosphoric acid).[10] Although first discovered
within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, nucleic acids are now known to be found
in all life forms including within bacteria, archaea, mitochondria,
chloroplasts, viruses, and viroids.[11] (There is debate as to whether_viruses
are_living_or_non-living.) All living cells contain both DNA and RNA (except
some cells such as mature red blood cells), while viruses contain either DNA or
RNA, but usually not both.[12] The basic component of biological nucleic acids
is the nucleotide, each of which contains a pentose sugar (ribose or
deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nucleobase.[13] Nucleic acids are also
generated within the laboratory, through the use of enzymes[14] (DNA and RNA
polymerases) and by solid-phase_chemical_synthesis. The chemical methods also
enable the generation of altered nucleic acids that are not found in nature,
[15] for example peptide_nucleic_acids.
***** Molecular composition and size[edit] *****
Nucleic acids are generally very large molecules. Indeed, DNA molecules are
probably the largest individual molecules known. Well-studied biological
nucleic acid molecules range in size from 21 nucleotides (small_interfering
RNA) to large chromosomes (human_chromosome_1 is a single molecule that
contains 247 million base_pairs[16]).
In most cases, naturally occurring DNA molecules are double-stranded and RNA
molecules are single-stranded.[17] There are numerous exceptions,
howeverâsome viruses have genomes made of double-stranded_RNA and other
viruses have single-stranded_DNA genomes,[18] and, in some circumstances,
nucleic acid structures with three or four strands can form.[19]
Nucleic acids are linear polymers (chains) of nucleotides. Each nucleotide
consists of three components: a purine or pyrimidine nucleobase (sometimes
termed nitrogenous base or simply base), a pentose sugar, and a phosphate
group. The substructure consisting of a nucleobase plus sugar is termed a
nucleoside. Nucleic acid types differ in the structure of the sugar in their
nucleotidesâDNA contains 2'-deoxyribose while RNA contains ribose (where the
only difference is the presence of a hydroxyl_group). Also, the nucleobases
found in the two nucleic acid types are different: adenine, cytosine, and
guanine are found in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs in DNA and uracil
occurs in RNA.
The sugars and phosphates in nucleic acids are connected to each other in an
alternating chain (sugar-phosphate backbone) through phosphodiester linkages.
[20] In conventional_nomenclature, the carbons to which the phosphate groups
attach are the 3'-end and the 5'-end carbons of the sugar. This gives nucleic
acids directionality, and the ends of nucleic acid molecules are referred to as
5'-end and 3'-end. The nucleobases are joined to the sugars via an N-glycosidic
linkage involving a nucleobase ring nitrogen (N-1 for pyrimidines and N-9 for
purines) and the 1' carbon of the pentose sugar ring.
Non-standard nucleosides are also found in both RNA and DNA and usually arise
from modification of the standard nucleosides within the DNA molecule or the
primary (initial) RNA transcript. Transfer_RNA (tRNA) molecules contain a
particularly large number of modified nucleosides.[21]
***** Topology[edit] *****
Double-stranded nucleic acids are made up of complementary sequences, in which
extensive Watson-Crick_base_pairing results in a highly repeated and quite
uniform double-helical_three-dimensional_structure.[22] In contrast, single-
stranded RNA and DNA molecules are not constrained to a regular double helix,
and can adopt highly_complex_three-dimensional_structures that are based on
short stretches of intramolecular base-paired sequences including both Watson-
Crick and noncanonical base pairs, and a wide range of complex tertiary
interactions.[23]
Nucleic acid molecules are usually unbranched, and may occur as linear and
circular molecules. For example, bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, mitochondrial
DNA, and chloroplast DNA are usually circular double-stranded DNA molecules,
while chromosomes of the eukaryotic nucleus are usually linear double-stranded
DNA molecules.[12] Most RNA molecules are linear, single-stranded molecules,
but both circular and branched molecules can result from RNA_splicing
reactions.[24] The total amount of pyrimidine is equal to the total amount of
purines. The diameter of the helix is about 20A.
***** Sequences[edit] *****
Main article: Nucleic_acid_sequence
One DNA or RNA molecule differs from another primarily in the sequence_of
nucleotides. Nucleotide sequences are of great importance in biology since they
carry the ultimate instructions that encode all biological molecules, molecular
assemblies, subcellular and cellular structures, organs, and organisms, and
directly enable cognition, memory, and behavior (see Genetics). Enormous
efforts have gone into the development of experimental methods to determine the
nucleotide sequence of biological DNA and RNA molecules,[25][26] and today
hundreds of millions of nucleotides are sequenced daily at genome centers and
smaller laboratories worldwide. In addition to maintaining the GenBank nucleic
acid sequence database, the National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information
(NCBI, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) provides analysis and retrieval resources
for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through the
NCBI web site.[27]
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Deoxyribonucleic acid[edit] ****
Main article: DNA
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid containing the genetic
instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living
organisms. The DNA segments carrying this genetic information are called genes.
Likewise, other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in
regulating the use of this genetic information. Along with RNA and proteins,
DNA is one of the three major macromolecules that are essential for all known
forms of life. DNA consists of two long polymers of simple units called
nucleotides, with backbones made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester
bonds. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are,
therefore, anti-parallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of
molecules called nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these
four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes information. This information
is read using the genetic code, which specifies the sequence of the amino acids
within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related
nucleic acid RNA in a process called transcription. Within cells DNA is
organized into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these
chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing each
cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals,
plants, fungi, and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus
and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In
contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the
cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact
and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA
and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.
**** Ribonucleic acid[edit] ****
Main article: RNA
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) functions in converting genetic information from genes
into the amino acid sequences of proteins. The three universal types of RNA
include transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
Messenger_RNA acts to carry genetic sequence information between DNA and
ribosomes, directing protein synthesis. Ribosomal_RNA is a major component of
the ribosome, and catalyzes peptide bond formation. Transfer_RNA serves as the
carrier molecule for amino acids to be used in protein synthesis, and is
responsible for decoding the mRNA. In addition, many other classes_of_RNA are
now known.
**** Artificial nucleic acid[edit] ****
Main article: Nucleic_acid_analogue
Artificial nucleic_acid_analogues have been designed and synthesized by
chemists, and include peptide_nucleic_acid, morpholino- and locked_nucleic
acid, glycol_nucleic_acid, and threose_nucleic_acid. Each of these is
distinguished from naturally occurring DNA or RNA by changes to the backbone of
the molecules.
