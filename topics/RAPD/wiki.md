RAPD (pronounced as "rapid") stands for 'Random Amplification of Polymorphic
DNA'.[1] It is a type of PCR, but the segments of DNA that are amplified are
random. The scientist performing RAPD creates several arbitrary, short primers
(8â12 nucleotides), then proceeds with the PCR using a large template of
genomic DNA, hoping that fragments will amplify. By resolving the resulting
patterns, a semi-unique profile can be gleaned from an RAPD reaction.
No knowledge of the DNA sequence of the targeted genome is required, as the
primers will bind somewhere in the sequence, but it is not certain exactly
where. This makes the method popular for comparing the DNA of biological
systems that have not had the attention of the scientific community, or in a
system in which relatively few DNA sequences are compared (it is not suitable
for forming a cDNA databank). Because it relies on a large, intact DNA template
sequence, it has some limitations in the use of degraded DNA samples. Its
resolving power is much lower than targeted, species-specific DNA comparison
methods, such as short_tandem_repeats. In recent years, RAPD has been used to
characterize, and trace, the phylogeny of diverse plant and animal species.

***** Introduction[edit] *****
RAPD markers are decamer (10 nucleotides long) DNA fragments from PCR
amplification of random segments of genomic DNA with single primer of arbitrary
nucleotide sequence and which are able to differentiate between genetically
distinct individuals, although not necessarily in a reproducible way. It is
used to analyse the genetic diversity of an individual by using random primers.
Due to problems in experiment reproducibility, many scientific journals do not
accept experiments merely based on RAPDs anymore. RAPD requires only one primer
for amplification.
***** How it works[edit] *****
Unlike traditional PCR analysis, RAPD does not require any specific knowledge
of the DNA sequence of the target organism: the identical 10-mer primers will
or will not amplify a segment of DNA, depending on positions that are
complementary to the primers' sequence. For example, no fragment is produced if
primers annealed too far apart or 3' ends of the primers are not facing each
other. Therefore, if a mutation has occurred in the template DNA at the site
that was previously complementary to the primer, a PCR product will not be
produced, resulting in a different pattern of amplified DNA segments on the
gel.
***** Example[edit] *****
RAPD is an inexpensive yet powerful typing method for many bacterial species.
The image visible at the link [1] is a silver-stained polyacrylamide gel
showing three distinct RAPD profiles generated by primer OPE15 for Haemophilus
ducreyi isolates from Tanzania, Senegal, Thailand, Europe, and North America.
Selecting the right sequence for the primer is very important because different
sequences will produce different band patterns and possibly allow for a more
specific recognition of individual strains.
**** Limitations[edit] ****
    * Nearly all RAPD markers are dominant, i.e. it is not possible to
      distinguish whether a DNA segment is amplified from a locus that is
      heterozygous (1 copy) or homozygous (2 copies). Codominant RAPD markers,
      observed as different-sized DNA segments amplified from the same locus,
      are detected only rarely.
    * PCR is an enzymatic reaction, therefore, the quality and concentration of
      template DNA, concentrations of PCR components, and the PCR cycling
      conditions may greatly influence the outcome. Thus, the RAPD technique is
      notoriously laboratory dependent and needs carefully developed laboratory
      protocols to be reproducible.
    * Mismatches between the primer and the template may result in the total
      absence of PCR product as well as in a merely decreased amount of the
      product. Thus, the RAPD results can be difficult to interpret.
**** Developing locus-specific, co-dominant markers from RAPDs[edit] ****
    * The polymorphic RAPD marker band is isolated from the gel.
    * It is amplified in the PCR reaction.
    * The PCR product is cloned and sequenced.
    * New longer and specific primers are designed for the DNA sequence, which
      is called the Sequenced Characterized Amplified Region Marker (SCAR).
