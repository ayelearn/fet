Brick and mortar (also bricks and mortar or B&M) refers to a physical presence
of an organization or business in a building or other structure. The term
brick-and-mortar business is often used to refer to a company that possesses or
leases retail_shops, factory production facilities, or warehouses for its
operations.[1] More specifically, in the jargon of e-commerce businesses in the
2000s, brick-and-mortar businesses are companies that have a physical presence
(e.g., a retail_shop in a building) and offer face-to-face customer
experiences.
This term is usually used to contrast with a transitory business or an
Internet-only presence, such as fully online_shops, which have no physical
presence for shoppers to visit, talk with staff in person, touch and handle
products and buy from the firm in person. However, such online businesses
normally have non-public physical facilities from which they either run
business operations (e.g., the company headquarters and back_office
facilities), and/or warehouses for storing and distributing products.[2]
Concerns such as foot traffic, shopfront visibility, and appealing interior
design apply to brick-and-mortar businesses rather than online ones. An online-
only business needs to have an attractive, well-designed website, a reliable e-
commerce system for payment, a good delivery or shipping service and effective
online marketing tactics to drive web_traffic to the site. Governments are also
adopting e-government approaches, which is the use of online services for
citizens to enable them to fill in government forms, pay tax bills and register
for government programs online; these services aim to cut bricks and mortar
costs (building leasing/purchase and staff costs) and improve services to
citizens (by offering 24/7 access to information and services).

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The name is a metonym derived from the traditional building materials
associated with physical buildings: bricks and mortar. The term was originally
used by 19th century British novelist Charles_Dickens in the book Little
Dorrit.[3] The term brick-and-mortar businesses is also a retronym, in that
most shops had a physical presence before the advent of the Internet. The term
is also applicable in a pre-Internet era, when contrasting businesses with
physical retail presence with those that operated strictly in an order-by-mail
capacity pre-Internet.
***** History[edit] *****
A fruit stand at a village market in Afghanistan.
The history of brick and mortar businesses cannot be dated precisely, but it
existed in the earliest vendor stalls in the first towns, where merchants
brought their agricultural produce, clay pots and handmade clothing to sell in
a village market. Bricks and mortar businesses remain important in the 2010s,
though many shops and services, ranging from consumer_electronics shops to
clothing_shops and even grocery_shops have begun offering online shopping. This
physical presence, either of a retail shop, a customer_service location with
staff, where clients can go in person to ask questions about a product or
service, or a service center or repair facility where customers can bring their
products, has played a crucial role in providing goods and services to
consumers throughout history.
All large retailers in the 19th and the early to mid-20th century started off
with a smaller brick and mortar presence, which increased as the businesses
grew. A prime example of this is McDonaldâs, a company that started with one
small restaurant and now has nearly 36,000 restaurants in over 120 countries
and plans to grow further; this shows the importance of having a physical
presence.[4] For many small_businesses, their business model is mostly limited
to a bricks and mortar model, such as a diner restaurant or a dry_cleaning
service. Nevertheless, even service-based businesses can use websites and
"apps" to reach new customers or improve their services. For example, a dry
cleaning service could use a website to let customers know of the hours and
location(s) of their bricks and mortar stores.
***** Decline[edit] *****
Netflix, an online movie_streaming website founded in 1997, is an example of
how an online business has affected a B&M businesses such as video_rental
stores. After Netflix and similar companies became popular, traditional DVD
rental stores such as Blockbuster_LLC went out of business. Customers preferred
to be able to instantly watch movies and TV shows using "streaming", without
having to go to a physical rental store to rent a DVD, and then return to the
store to give the DVD back. "The rapid rise of online_film_streaming offered by
the likes of Lovefilm and Netflix made Blockbuster's video and DVD [rental]
business model practically obsolete.'[5]
There has been an increase in online retailers in the 2000s, as people are
using e-commerce (online sales) to fulfill basic needs ranging from grocery
shopping to book purchases. Sales through mobile devices such as tablet
computers and smartphones have also risen in the 2000s: "While total online
sales rose 18% year-on-year in December to Â£11.1 [B], according to the latest
figures [January 2014] from e-tail industry body IMRG and advisory firm
Capgemini, sales via mobile devices doubled to Â£3 [B].'[6]
The increase in households where both adults work outside the home, combined
with the convenience of shopping for and buying products and services online,
has decreased the number of customers going to retail outlets, as consumers can
access the same information about products and services without paying for gas,
parking and other costs, thus saving them time and money. "Todayâs consumers
lead busy lives and [Bricks and Mortar] shopping takes time. Often it is a
[challenging] task. Consumers find researching and shopping on the Web far more
convenient than brick-and-mortar visits."[7] Another example of this is the
introduction of online banking, which has affected bank branches on the High
Street: "Barclays will shut at least 50 [Bricks and Mortar] branches this
year."[8] Brick and mortar businesses are not limited to having a physical
presence only, they may also have an online presence such as Tesco, who offer
an online grocery service as well as a brick and mortar retail presence.
***** Benefits[edit] *****
The presence of brick and mortar establishments may bring many benefits to
businesses;
    * Customer_service: face-to-face customer service can be a big contributor
      into increasing sales of a business and improving customer satisfaction.
      When customers can take a product back to the store to ask staff
      questions or help them learn to use it, it can make customers feel more
      satisfied with their purchase. Research has shown that 86% of customers
      will pay more for a product if they have received great customer service.
      [9]
    * Face-to-face interaction: Many consumers prefer to be able to touch
      products, and experience and test them out before they buy. This is often
      attributed to Baby_Boomers, older Generation_X customers and the elderly
      being used to a more traditional in-person approach when it comes to
      shopping and preferring to have a demonstration of products or services,
      especially when buying new technology .[10] Other studies show, given
      equal prices, a 90% preference for the in-person shopping experience,
      including among teens, who combine social interaction with shopping. On
      the other hand, many of these consumers engage in showrooming: trying on
      clothes or otherwise examining merchandise in-store, and then buying
      online at cheaper prices.[11]
***** Drawbacks[edit] *****
The brick and mortar approach also has various drawbacks.
**** New businesses and fixed costs[edit] ****
Fixed_costs are a serious challenge for B&M businesses. Fixed costs are
payments that a business has to make for elements such as rent of a store and
monthly payments for services such as a security_alarm. Fixed costs stay the
same for a business even if it ramps up its operations or winds down its
operations during a slow period. In contrast, variable_costs change as a
business ramps its operations up or down. Variable costs include wages (for
employees paid by the hour) and electricity for operating machinery used by the
business during its operating hours. If a business increases its hours of
operation, its hourly wages and electricity bill will rise, but its rent and
security alarm costs will stay the same (assuming that the business does not
add additional locations). Start-up_companies and other small_businesses
typically find it hard to pay all of the fixed costs that are part of their
venture. Research shows that 70% of new start up businesses fail within the
first 10 years.[12]
**** Inconvenient for customers with busy lifestyles[edit] ****
People have busier lifestyles in the 2010s, with more families having both
adults working, and therefore they find it harder to find the time to
physically go and shop at stores and services. As well, in many cities traffic
jams and congestion on roads have made it more stressful and time-consuming to
drive to physical locations to shop. Online shopping and online services, which
consumers can access from an Internet-connected laptop or smartphone are more
convenient for these people.[13] With mobile devices, consumers can order take-
out food, gifts and services even when they are "on the go", such as stuck
sitting on a bus or waiting in an airport lounge for a plane.
**** Expensive and luxury products[edit] ****
B&M increases the fixed cost for any business, therefore the products sold in
physical shops tend to be more expensive compared to online shops. For stores
selling expensive products or services in a B&M format, customers expect
beautiful window displays, fine decorating in the establishment and well-
dressed salespeople who earn high commission on their sales. Some high-end hair
salons and luxury car stores even offer conveniences such as free espresso and
bottled water, all of which add to the overhead of selling these products and
services. Online shops, even those for luxury goods, do not have to pay for
high-end retail stores and salespeople.[14], [15] Nevertheless, high-end online
stores typically incur higher costs for their online presence, because they
need to have leading edge Web_2.0 functions on their website, a professionally
designed site, and in some cases, staff available to respond to phone calls, e-
mails and online "chat" questions.
**** Wider stock availability online[edit] ****
Products may be out stock in relatively small brick and mortar retail stores
and due to limited space in small_business retail stores, these establishments
may only be able to carry a few types of each product. Online shops are able to
have a huge amount of stock in numerous large warehouses (e.g., Amazon.com has
warehouses in numerous locations from which it ships its products) which it can
quickly ship out. An online store may be able to order up products from a large
number of geographically dispersed warehouses, even warehouses owned and
operated by third parties (e.g., smaller companies), which are connected to the
large company via the Internet.
**** Queues[edit] ****
Queues (lineups and waiting_rooms) are part and parcel of B&M retail
businesses, due to physical constraints and the limitations on how many staff
the business can afford to hire. A physical store may only have a few
salespeople to serve customers, so many customers may have to wait in line
during the busiest hours. To lessen the stress of waiting, some B&M stores
provide big-screen TVs with cable TV, free coffee and newspapers; while these
niceties improve the customer experience, they add to the costs of operating a
B&M establishment. On the other hand, an online virtual store in which
customers select their own purchases in a virtual "shopping cart" and pay for
them using e-commerce approaches may be able to serve thousands of customers at
the same time.
***** E-government[edit] *****
Main article: E-government
Beginning in the 1990s and early 2000s, many governments in industrialised
countries began to offer e-government services to citizens. Online government
services are offered by a range of government departments and agencies, ranging
from departments of motor vehicles (online car registration), police (paying
speeding_tickets online), city services (paying parking_tickets online or
requesting that a pothole be filled) and social services (registering for
social_assistance or unemployment_insurance) and tax departments (paying a tax
bill or submitting a tax_return online). Many governments use e-services to
provide online information to citizens (e.g., "help" guides, Frequently_Asked
Question lists, manuals for government program applicants, etc.), thus saving
on the need for call_centers where citizens can call to ask questions or
physical service locations where citizens can come in person to ask about
government forms or services.
These online government services aim at two goals: reducing costs to
governments and improving client service. By offering these services and
information online, governments save money, because they do not have to offer
as many bricks and mortar client service centers where citizens can come and
fill in these forms and pay government bills. Governments offering e-services
can also operate with less civil_servants and thus less salary and benefits
costs, as the citizens using online services are generally doing all of the
administrative tasks (e.g., downloading a form, filling in a form, looking up
guidance in an online "help" manual, paying fees) themselves using their home
computer. E-government services also improve service for citizens who have
access to a computer, Internet and an online payment method (e.g., a credit
card or PayPal), because these citizens are not limited by the 9 am-5 pm or 8
am-4 pm business_hours of most physical government offices, and citizens do not
have to incur the costs of transportation (e.g., bus tickets, gas, parking,
etc.) associated with going to a bricks and mortar location. Nevertheless,
government e-services do not help all citizens, due to the digital_divide;
citizens who are in poverty, who are homeless or who live in rural or remote
regions may not have access to high speed Internet. These citizens, as well as
those who are not comfortable with computers or those who do not understand how
to use them, which in practice means elderly people, are not able to benefit
from e-services.
