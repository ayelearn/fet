Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The standard enthalpy of reaction (denoted ÎHrâ¦µ) is the enthalpy change that
occurs in a system when matter is transformed by a given chemical_reaction,
when all reactants and products are in their standard_states.
For a generic chemical reaction
      âvA A + âvB B + ... â vP P + vQ Q ...
the standard enthalpy of reaction ÎHrâ¦µ is related to the standard_enthalpy
of_formation ÎHfâ¦µ of the reactants and products by the following equation
neglecting the heat_of_mixing of reagents and products or assuming ideal
solutions involved:
         &#x0394;  H   r    &#x2296;   =  &#x2211;  B     v  B   &#x0394;  H
      f    &#x2296;   ( B )    {\displaystyle \Delta H_{\mathrm {r} }^{\ominus
      }=\sum _{B}{v_{B}\Delta H_{\mathrm {f} }^{\ominus }(B)}}  [\Delta H_{
      {\mathrm  {r}}}^{\ominus }=\sum _{{B}}{v_{B}\Delta H_{{\mathrm  {f}}}^
      {\ominus }(B)}]
In this equation, vB is the stoichiometric_number of entity B. The standard
enthalpy_of_formation, which has been determined for a vast number of
substances, is the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the
substance from its constituent elements, with all substances in their standard
states.
The enthalpy change of any reaction under any conditions can be computed from
the above equation, given the standard enthalpy of formation of the reactants
and products. The enthalpy change is defined as the amount of heat absorbed or
evolved in the transformation of the reactants at a given temperature and
pressure into the products at the same temperature and pressure.
***** Heat of reaction at constant pressure and at constant volume[edit] *****
The heat of a reaction depends upon the conditions under which the reaction is
carried out. There are two general conditions under which thermochemical
measurements are made.
      (a) Constant volume and temperature: heat      Q  v   = &#x0394; E
      {\displaystyle Q_{v}=\Delta E}  [{\displaystyle Q_{v}=\Delta E}]
      (b) Constant pressure and temperature: heat      Q  p   = &#x0394; H
      {\displaystyle Q_{p}=\Delta H}  [{\displaystyle Q_{p}=\Delta H}]
The magnitudes of the heat effects in these two conditions are different. In
the first case the volume of the system is kept constant during the course of
the measurement by carrying out the reaction in a closed and rigid container
and as there is no change in the volume and so no work is also involved.
From the first law of thermodynamics we have a relation,     &#x0394; E =  Q  v
{\displaystyle \Delta E=Q_{v}}  [\Delta E=Q_{v}]
That is, the heat of a reaction at constant volume is equal to the change in
the internal energy (Î E) of the reacting system.
The thermal change that occurs in a chemical reaction is only due to the
difference in the sum of internal energy of the products and the sum of the
internal energy of reactants.
         &#x0394; E = &#x2211;  E  p r o d u c t s   &#x2212; &#x2211;  E  r e
      a c t a n t s     {\displaystyle \Delta E=\sum E_{products}-\sum E_
      {reactants}}  [\Delta E=\sum E_{{products}}-\sum E_{{reactants}}]
This also signifies that the amount of heat absorbed at constant volume could
be identified with the change in the thermodynamic quantity internal energy.
At constant pressure on the other hand, the system is either kept open to the
atmosphere or confined within a container on which a constant external pressure
is exerted and under these conditions the volume of the system changes. The
thermal change at a constant pressure not only involves the change in the
internal energy of the system but also the work performed either in expansion
or contraction of the system.
          Q  p   = &#x0394; E + W   {\displaystyle Q_{p}=\Delta E+W}  [Q_
      {p}=\Delta E+W] (work)
If âWâ is only pressure-volume_work, then
          Q  p   = &#x0394; H = &#x0394; E + P &#x0394; V   {\displaystyle Q_
      {p}=\Delta H=\Delta E+P\Delta V}  [Q_{p}=\Delta H=\Delta E+P\Delta V]
          Q  p   =  (  &#x2211;  E  p   &#x2212; &#x2211;  E  r    )  + P
      (   V  p   &#x2212;  V  r    )    {\displaystyle Q_{p}=\left(\sum E_{p}-
      \sum E_{r}\right)+P\left(V_{p}-V_{r}\right)}  [Q_{p}=\left(\sum E_{p}-
      \sum E_{r}\right)+P\left(V_{p}-V_{r}\right)]
          Q  p   =  (  &#x2211;  E  p   + P  V  p    )  &#x2212;  (  &#x2211;
      E  r   + P  V  r    )    {\displaystyle Q_{p}=\left(\sum E_{p}+PV_
      {p}\right)-\left(\sum E_{r}+PV_{r}\right)}  [Q_{p}=\left(\sum E_{p}+PV_
      {p}\right)-\left(\sum E_{r}+PV_{r}\right)]
As enthalpy or heat content is defined by     H = E + P V   {\displaystyle
H=E+PV}  [H=E+PV].
So we have,      Q  p   = &#x2211;  H  p   &#x2212; &#x2211;  H  r   = &#x0394;
H   {\displaystyle Q_{p}=\sum H_{p}-\sum H_{r}=\Delta H}  [Q_{p}=\sum H_{p}-
\sum H_{r}=\Delta H]
At constant pressure, the heat of the reaction is exactly equal to the enthalpy
change,     &#x0394; H   {\displaystyle \Delta H}  [\Delta H], of the reacting
system.
