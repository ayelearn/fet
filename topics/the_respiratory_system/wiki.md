The respiratory system (also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a
biological_system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas
exchange in animals and plants. The anatomy and physiology that make this
happen varies greatly, depending on the size of the organism, the environment
in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land_animals the respiratory
surface is internalized as linings of the lungs.[1] Gas_exchange in the lungs
occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles,
but atria in birds. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply,
thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood.[2] These air sacs
communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow
tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the
chest into the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into
progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous
smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds the bronchioles are termed
parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the
microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from
the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which
involves the muscles_of_respiration.
In most fish, and a number of other aquatic_animals (both vertebrates and
invertebrates) the respiratory system consists of gills, which are either
partially or completely external organs, bathed in the watery environment. This
water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means. Gas
exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat filaments
and lammelae which expose a very large surface area of highly vascularized
tissue to the water.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple
anatomical features, and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas
exchange. Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas
exchange can be opposite to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants
includes anatomical features such as stomata, that are found in various parts
of the plant.[3]

In humans and other mammals, the anatomy of a typical respiratory system is the
respiratory_tract. The tract is divided into an upper and a lower_respiratory
tract. The upper tract includes the nose, nasal_cavities, sinuses, pharynx and
the part of the larynx above the vocal_folds. The lower tract (Fig. 2.)
includes the lower part of the larynx, the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and
the alveoli.
The branching airways of the lower tract are often described as the respiratory
tree or tracheobronchial tree (Fig. 2).[4] The intervals between successive
branch points along the various branches of "tree" are often referred to as
branching "generations", of which there are, in the adult human about 23. The
earlier generations (approximately generations 0â16), consisting of the
trachea and the bronchi, as well as the larger bronchioles which simply act as
air_conduits, bringing air to the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and
alveoli (approximately generations 17â23), where gas_exchange takes place.[5]
[6] Bronchioles are defined as the small airways lacking any cartilagenous
support.[4]
The first bronchi to branch from the trachea are the right and left main
bronchi. Second only in diameter to the trachea (1.8 cm), these bronchi (1 -
1.4 cm in diameter)[5] enter the lungs at each hilum, where they branch into
narrower secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi, and these branch into
narrower tertiary bronchi known as segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the
segmental bronchi (1 to 6 mm in diameter)[7] are known as 4th order, 5th order,
and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.
[8][9]
Compared to the, on average, 23 number of branchings of the respiratory tree in
the adult human, the mouse has only about 13 such branchings.
The alveoli are the dead end terminals of the "tree", meaning that any air that
enters them has to exit via the same route. A system such as this creates dead
space, a volume of air (about 150 ml in the adult human) that fills the airways
after exhalation and is breathed back into the alveoli before environmental air
reaches them.[10][11] At the end of inhalation the airways are filled with
environmental air, which is exhaled without coming in contact with the gas
exchanger.[10]
**** Ventilatory volumes ****
Main articles: Breathing and Lung_volumes
The lungs expand and contract during the breathing cycle, drawing air in and
out of the lungs. The volume of air moved in or out of the lungs under normal
resting circumstances (the resting tidal_volume of about 500 ml), and volumes
moved during maximally forced inhalation and maximally forced exhalation are
measured in humans by spirometry.[12] A typical adult human spirogram with the
names given to the various excursions in volume the lungs can undergo is
illustrated below (Fig. 3):
Fig. 3 Output of a 'spirometer'. Upward movement of the graph, read from the
left, indicates the intake of air; downward movements represent exhalation.
Not all the air in the lungs can be expelled during maximally forced
exhalation. This is the residual_volume of about 1.0-1.5 liters which cannot be
measured by spirometry. Volumes that include the residual volume (i.e.
functional_residual_capacity of about 2.5-3.0 liters, and total_lung_capacity
of about 6 liters) can therefore also not be measured by spirometry. Their
measurement requires special techniques.[12]
The rates at which air is breathed in or out, either through the mouth or nose,
or into or out of the alveoli are tabulated below, together with how they are
calculated. The number of breath cycles per minute is known as the respiratory
rate.

**** Mechanics of breathing ****

Fig. 6 Real-time magnetic_resonance_imaging (MRI) of the chest movements of
human thorax during breathing
Main article: Breathing_Â§ Mechanics
The "pump handle" and "bucket handle movements" of the ribs
Fig. 4 The effect of the muscles_of_inhalation in expanding the rib_cage. The
particular action illustrated here is called the pump_handle_movement of the
rib cage.
Fig. 5 In this view of the rib cage the downward slope of the lower ribs from
the midline outwards can be clearly seen. This allows a movement similar to the
"pump handle effect", but in this case it is called the bucket_handle_movement.
The color of the ribs refers to their classification, and is not relevant here.
Breathing
Fig. 7 The muscles of breathing at rest: inhalation on the left, exhalation on
the right. Contracting muscles are shown in red; relaxed muscles in blue.
Contraction of the diaphragm generally contributes the most to the expansion of
the chest cavity (light blue). However, at the same time, the intercostal
muscles pull the ribs upwards (their effect is indicated by arrows) also
causing the rib_cage to expand during inhalation (see diagram on other side of
the page). The relaxation of all these muscles during exhalation cause the rib
cage and abdomen (light green) to elastically return to their resting
positions. Compare with Fig. 6, the MRI video of the chest movements during the
breathing cycle.
Fig. 8 The muscles of forceful breathing (inhalation and exhalation). The color
code is the same as on the left. In addition to a more forceful and extensive
contraction of the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are aided by the
accessory muscles of inhalation to exaggerate the movement of the ribs upwards,
causing a greater expansion of the rib cage. During exhalation, apart from the
relaxation of the muscles of inhalation, the abdominal muscles actively
contract to pull the lower edges of the rib cage downwards decreasing the
volume of the rib cage, while at the same time pushing the diaphragm upwards
deep into the thorax.
In mammals, inhalation at rest is primarily due to the contraction of the
diaphragm. This is an upwardly domed sheet of muscle that separates the
thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it contracts the sheet
flattens, (i.e. moves downwards as shown in Fig. 7) increasing the volume of
the thoracic cavity. The contracting diaphragm pushes the abdominal organs
downwards. But because the pelvic floor prevents the lowermost abdominal organs
moving in that direction, the pliable abdominal contents cause the belly to
bulge outwards to the front and sides, because the relaxed abdominal muscles do
not resist this movement (Fig. 7). This entirely passive bulging (and shrinking
during exhalation) of the abdomen during normal breathing is sometimes referred
to as "abdominal breathing", although it is, in fact, "diaphragmatic
breathing", which is not visible on the outside of the body. Mammals only use
their abdominal muscles only during forceful exhalation (see Fig. 8, and
discussion below). Never during any form of inhalation.
As the diaphragm contracts, the rib_cage is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs
being pulled upwards by the intercostal_muscles as shown in Fig. 4. All the
ribs slant downwards from the rear to the front (as shown in Fig. 4); but the
lowermost ribs also slant downwards from the midline outwards (Fig. 5). Thus
the rib cage's transverse diameter can be increased in the same way as the
antero-posterior diameter is increase by the so-called pump_handle_movement
shown in Fig. 4.
The enlargement of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction
of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by the lifting of the front
and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs'
interiors are open to the outside air, and being elastic, therefore expand to
fill the increased space. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the
respiratory_airways (Fig. 2). In health these airways (starting at the nose or
mouth, and ending in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli) are always
open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the
sympathetic and parasympathetic_nervous_systems. The alveolar air pressure is
therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100 kPa at sea level)
at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to move in and out of the
lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2â3 kPa.[13][14]
During exhalation the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax. This returns the
chest and abdomen to a position determined by their anatomical elasticity. This
is the "resting mid-position" of the thorax and abdomen (Fig. 7) when the lungs
contain their functional_residual_capacity of air (the light blue area in the
right hand illustration of Fig. 7), which in the adult human has a volume of
about 2.5â3.0 liters (Fig. 3).[6] Resting exhalation lasts about twice as
long as inhalation because the diaphragm relaxes passively more gently than it
contracts actively during inhalation.
Fig. 9 The changes in the composition of the alveolar air during a normal
breathing cycle at rest. The scale on the left, and the blue line, indicate the
partial pressures of carbon dioxide in kPa, while that on the right and the red
line, indicate the partial pressures of oxygen, also in kPa (to convert kPa
into mm Hg, multiply by 7.5).
The volume of air that moves in or out (at the nose or mouth) during a single
breathing cycle is called the tidal_volume. In a resting adult human it is
about 500 ml per breath. At the end of exhalation the airways contain about
150 ml of alveolar air which is the first air that is breathed back into the
alveoli during inhalation.[10][15] This volume air that is breathed out of the
alveoli and back in again is known as dead_space ventilation, which has the
consequence that of the 500 ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only
350 ml (500 ml - 150 ml = 350 ml) is fresh warm and moistened air.[6] Since
this 350 ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that
remains in the alveoli after normal exhalation (i.e. the functional_residual
capacity of about 2.5â3.0 liters), it is clear that the composition of the
alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The
oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14 kPa (about
100 mm Hg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3 kPa (or 40 mm Hg).
This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the
partial pressure of oxygen is 21 kPa (or 160 mm Hg) and that of carbon dioxide
0.04 kPa (or 0.3 mmHg).[6]
During heavy breathing (hyperpnea), as, for instance, during exercise,
inhalation is brought about by a more powerful and greater excursion of the
contracting diaphragm than at rest (Fig. 8). In addition the "accessory_muscles
of_inhalation" exaggerate the actions of the intercostal muscles (Fig. 8).
These accessory muscles of inhalation are muscles that extend from the cervical
vertebrae and base of the skull to the upper ribs and sternum, sometimes
through an intermediary attachment to the clavicles.[6] When they contract the
rib cage's internal volume is increased to a far greater extent than can be
achieved by contraction of the intercostal muscles alone. Seen from outside the
body the lifting of the clavicles during strenuous or labored inhalation is
sometimes called clavicular_breathing, seen especially during asthma attacks
and in people with chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease.
During heavy breathing, exhalation is caused by relaxation of all the muscles
of inhalation. But now, the abdominal muscles, instead of remaining relaxed (as
they do at rest), contract forcibly pulling the lower edges of the rib_cage
downwards (front and sides) (Fig. 8). This not only drastically decreases the
size of the rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the
diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax (Fig. 8). The end-
exhalatory lung volume is now well below the resting mid-position and contains
far less air than the resting "functional residual capacity". However, in a
normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human there
is always still at least 1 liter of residual air left in the lungs after
maximum exhalation.[6]
The automatic rhythmical breathing in and out, can be interrupted by coughing,
sneezing (forms of very forceful exhalation), by the expression of a wide range
of emotions (laughing, sighing, crying out in pain, exasperated intakes of
breath) and by such voluntary acts as speech, singing, whistling and the
playing of wind instruments. All of these actions rely on the muscles described
above, and their effects on the movement of air in and out of the lungs.
Although not a form of breathing, the Valsalva_maneuver involves the
respiratory muscles. It is, in fact, a very forceful exhalatory effort against
a tightly closed glottis, so that no air can escape from the lungs.[16] Instead
abdominal contents are evacuated in the opposite direction, through orifices in
the pelvic floor. The abdominal muscles contract very powerfully, causing the
pressure inside the abdomen and thorax to rise to extremely high levels. The
Valsalva maneuver can be carried out voluntarily, but is more generally a
reflex elicited when attempting to empty the abdomen during, for instance,
difficult defecation, or during childbirth. Breathing ceases during this
maneuver.
**** Gas exchange ****
Main article: Gas_exchange
Mechanism of gas exchange
Fig. 11 A highly diagrammatic illustration of the process of gas exchange in
the mammalian lungs, emphasizing the differences between the gas compositions
of the ambient air, the alveolar air (light blue) with which the pulmonary
capillary blood equilibrates, and the blood gas tensions in the pulmonary
arterial (blue blood entering the lung on the left) and venous blood (red blood
leaving the lung on the right). All the gas tensions are in kPa. To convert to
mm Hg, multiply by 7.5.
Fig. 12 A diagrammatic histological cross-section through a portion of lung
tissue showing a normally inflated alveolus (at the end of a normal
exhalation), and its walls containing the pulmonary_capillaries (shown in
cross-section). This illustrates how the pulmonary capillary blood is
completely surrounded by alveolar air. In a normal human lung all the alveoli
together contain about 3 liters of alveolar air. All the pulmonary capillaries
contain about 100 ml blood.
Fig. 10 A histological cross-section through an alveolar wall showing the
layers through which the gases have to move between the blood plasma and the
alveolar air. The dark blue objects are the nuclei of the capillary endothelial
and alveolar type I epithelial cells (or type 1 pneumocytes). The two red
objects labeled "RBC" are red_blood_cells in the pulmonary capillary blood.
The primary purpose of the respiratory system is the equilibration of the
partial pressures of the respiratory gases in the alveolar air with those in
the pulmonary capillary blood (Fig. 11). This process occurs by simple
diffusion,[17] across a very thin membrane (known as the bloodâair_barrier),
which forms the walls of the pulmonary_alveoli (Fig. 10). It consisting of the
alveolar_epithelial_cells, their basement_membranes and the endothelial_cells
of the alveolar capillaries (Fig. 10).[18] This blood gas barrier is extremely
thin (in humans, on average, 2.2 Î¼m thick). It is folded into about 300
million small air sacs called alveoli[18] (each between 75 and 300 Âµm in
diameter) branching off from the respiratory bronchioles in the lungs, thus
providing an extremely large surface area (approximately 145 m2) for gas
exchange to occur.[18]
The air contained within the alveoli has a semi-permanent volume of about 2.5-
3.0 liters which completely surrounds the alveolar capillary blood (Fig. 12).
This ensures that equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the
two compartments is very efficient and occurs very quickly. The blood leaving
the alveolar capillaries and is eventually distributed throughout the body
therefore has a partial_pressure of oxygen of 13-14 kPa (100 mmHg), and a
partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide of 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg) (i.e. the same as the
oxygen and carbon dioxide gas tensions as in the alveoli).[6] As mentioned in
the_section_above, the corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon
dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are 21 kPa (160 mmHg) and
0.04 kPa (0.3 mmHg) respectively.[6]
This marked difference between the composition of the alveolar air and that of
the ambient air can be maintained because the functional_residual_capacity is
contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by fairly narrow and
relatively long tubes (the airways: nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and
their branches down to the bronchioles), through which the air has to be
breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no unidirectional through-flow as there
is in the bird_lung). This typical mammalian anatomy combined with the fact
that the lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a
substantial volume of air, of about 2.5-3.0 liters, in the alveoli after
exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is only minimally
disturbed when the 350 ml of fresh air is mixed into it with each inhalation.
Thus the animal is provided with a very special "portable atmosphere", whose
composition differs significantly from the present-day_ambient_air.[19] It is
this portable atmosphere (the functional_residual_capacity) to which the blood
and therefore the body tissues are exposed â not to the outside air.
The resulting arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are
homeostatically_controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of CO2 and,
to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of O2, will
reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood_gas_tensions in the
lungs, and therefore the arterial blood, return to normal. The converse happens
when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen
tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas
normality is restored.
Since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of
O2 of, on average, 6 kPa (45 mmHg), while the pressure in the alveolar air is
13-14 kPa (100 mmHg), there will be a net diffusion of oxygen into the
capillary blood, changing the composition of the 3 liters of alveolar air
slightly. Similarly, since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a
partial pressure of CO2 of also about 6 kPa (45 mmHg), whereas that of the
alveolar air is 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg), there is a net movement of carbon dioxide
out of the capillaries into the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net
flows of individual gases into and out of the alveolar air necessitate the
replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every 5 seconds
or so. This is very tightly controlled by the monitoring of the arterial blood
gases (which accurately reflect composition of the alveolar air) by the aortic
and carotid_bodies, as well as by the blood_gas_and_pH_sensor on the anterior
surface of the medulla_oblongata in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon
dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they primarily determine the diameters of the
bronchioles and pulmonary_capillaries, and are therefore responsible for
directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.
It is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the
3 liters of alveolar air that with each breath some carbon dioxide is
discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside
air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of
hyperventilation, respiration will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar
partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg). It is
therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory
system is to rid the body of carbon dioxide âwasteâ. The carbon dioxide
that is breathed out with each breath could probably be more correctly be seen
as a byproduct of the bodyâs extracellular fluid carbon_dioxide and pH
homeostats
If these homeostats are compromised, then a respiratory_acidosis, or a
respiratory_alkalosis will occur. In the long run these can be compensated by
renal adjustments to the H+_and_HCO3â_concentrations_in_the_plasma; but since
this takes time, the hyperventilation_syndrome can, for instance, occur when
agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a
distressing respiratory_alkalosis through the blowing off of too much CO2 from
the blood into the outside air.[20]
Oxygen has a very low solubility in water, and is therefore carried in the
blood loosely combined with hemoglobin. The oxygen is held on the hemoglobin by
four ferrous_iron-containing heme groups per hemoglobin molecule. When all the
heme groups carry one O2 molecule each the blood is said to be âsaturatedâ
with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will
meaningfully increase the oxygen concentration of the blood. Most of the carbon
dioxide in the blood is carried as bicarbonate ions (HCO3â) in the plasma.
However the conversion of dissolved CO2 into HCO3â (through the addition of
water) is too slow for the rate at which the blood circulates through the
tissues on the one hand, and through alveolar capillaries on the other. The
reaction is therefore catalyzed by carbonic_anhydrase, an enzyme inside the red
blood_cells.[21] The reaction can go in both directions depending on the
prevailing partial pressure of CO2.[6] A small amount of carbon dioxide is
carried on the protein portion of the hemoglobin molecules as carbamino groups.
The total concentration of carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate ions,
dissolved CO2, and carbamino groups) in arterial blood (i.e. after it has
equilibrated with the alveolar air) is about 26 mM (or 58 ml/100 ml),[22]
compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about
9 mM (or 20 ml/100 ml blood).[6]
**** Control of ventilation ****
Main article: Control_of_ventilation
Ventilation of the lungs in mammals occurs via the respiratory_centers in the
medulla_oblongata and the pons of the brainstem.[6] These areas form a series
of neural_pathways which receive information about the partial_pressures_of
oxygen_and_carbon_dioxide in the arterial_blood. This information determines
the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep these
pressures_constant. The respiratory center does so via motor_nerves which
activate the diaphragm and other muscles_of_respiration.
The breathing rate increases when the partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide in the
blood increases. This is detected by central_blood_gas_chemoreceptors on the
anterior surface of the medulla_oblongata.[6] The aortic and carotid_bodies,
are the peripheral_blood_gas_chemoreceptors which are particularly sensitive to
the arterial partial_pressure_of_O2 though they also respond, but less
strongly, to the partial pressure of CO2.[6] At sea level, under normal
circumstances, the breathing rate and depth, is determined primarily by the
arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide rather than by the arterial partial
pressure_of_oxygen, which is allowed to vary within a fairly wide range before
the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons respond to it to
change the rate and depth of breathing.[6]
Exercise increases the breathing rate due to the extra carbon dioxide produced
by the enhanced metabolism of the exercising muscles.[23] In addition passive
movements of the limbs also reflexively produce an increase in the breathing
rate.[6][23]
Information received from stretch_receptors in the lungs limits tidal_volume
(the depth of inhalation and exhalation).
**** Responses to low atmospheric pressures ****
The alveoli are open (via the airways) to the atmosphere, with the result that
alveolar air pressure is exactly the same as the ambient air pressure at sea
level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving chamber, or
decompression chamber) in which the individual is breathing freely. With
expansion of the lungs (through lowering of the diaphragm and expansion of the
thoracic_cage) the alveolar air now occupies a larger volume, and its pressure
falls_proportionally, causing air to flow in from the surroundings, through the
airways, till the pressure in the alveoli is once again at the ambient air
pressure. The reverse obviously happens during exhalation. This process (of
inhalation and exhalation) is exactly the same at sea level, as on top of Mt.
Everest, or in a diving_chamber or decompression_chamber.
Fig. 14 A graph showing the relationship between total atmospheric pressure and
altitude above sea level.
However, as one rises above sea level the density_of_the_air_decreases
exponentially (see Fig. 14), halving approximately with_every_5500 m_rise_in
altitude.[24] Since the composition of the atmospheric air is almost constant
below 80 km, as a result of the continuous mixing effect of the weather, the
concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O2 per liter of ambient air)
decreases at the same rate as the fall in air pressure with altitude.[25]
Therefore, in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen per minute, the
person has to inhale a proportionately greater volume of air per minute at
altitude than at sea level. This is achieved by breathing deeper and faster
(i.e. hyperpnea) than at sea level (see below).
Fig. 13 Aerial photo of Mount_Everest from the south, behind Nuptse and Lhotse.
There is, however, a complication that increases the volume of air that needs
to be inhaled per minute (respiratory_minute_volume) to provide the same amount
of oxygen to the lungs at altitude as at sea level. During inhalation the air
is warmed and saturated with water vapor during its passage through the nose
passages and pharynx. Saturated_water_vapor_pressure is dependent only on
temperature. At a body core temperature of 37 Â°C it is 6.3 kPa (47.0 mmHg),
irrespective of any other influences, including altitude.[26] Thus at sea
level, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 100 kPa, the moistened
air that flows into the lungs from the trachea consists of water vapor
(6.3 kPa), nitrogen (74.0 kPa), oxygen (19.7 kPa) and trace amounts of carbon
dioxide and other gases (a total of 100 kPa). In dry air the partial_pressure
of O2 at sea level is 21.0 kPa (i.e. 21% of 100 kPa), compared to the 19.7 kPa
of oxygen entering the alveolar air. (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen
is 21% of [100 kPa â 6.3 kPa] = 19.7 kPa). At the summit of Mt._Everest (at
an altitude of 8,848 m or 29,029 ft) the total atmospheric_pressure_is
33.7 kPa, of which 7.1 kPa (or 21%) is oxygen.[24] The air entering the lungs
also has a total pressure of 33.7 kPa, of which 6.3 kPa is, unavoidably, water
vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen
entering the alveoli to 5.8 kPa (or 21% of [33.7 kPa â 6.3 kPa] = 5.8 kPa).
The reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore
substantially greater than the reduction of the total atmospheric pressure at
altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8 kPa vs. 7.1 kPa).
A further minor complication exists at altitude. If the volume of the lungs
were to be instantaneously doubled at the beginning of inhalation, the air
pressure inside the lungs would be halved. This happens regardless of altitude.
Thus, halving of the sea level air pressure (100 kPa) results in an
intrapulmonary air pressure of 50 kPa. Doing the same at 5500 m, where the
atmospheric pressure is only 50 kPa, the intrapulmonary air pressure falls to
25 kPa. Therefore, the same change in lung volume at sea level results in a
50 kPa difference in pressure between the ambient air and the intrapulmonary
air, whereas it result in a difference of only 25 kPa at 5500 m. The driving
pressure forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is therefore halved at
this altitude. The rate of inflow of air into the lungs during inhalation at
sea level is therefore twice that which occurs at 5500 m. However, in reality,
inhalation and exhalation occur far more gently and less abruptly than in the
example given. The differences between the atmospheric and intrapulmonary
pressures, driving air in and out of the lungs during the breathing cycle, are
in the region of only 2â3 kPa.[13][14] A doubling or more of these small
pressure differences could be achieved only by very major changes in the
breathing effort at high altitudes.
All of the above influences of low atmospheric pressures on breathing are
accommodated primarily by breathing deeper and faster (hyperpnea). The exact
degree of hyperpnea is determined by the blood_gas_homeostat, which regulates
the partial_pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This
homeostat prioritizes the regulation of the arterial partial_pressure of carbon
dioxide over that of oxygen at sea level.[6] That is to say, at sea level the
arterial partial pressure of CO2 is maintained at very close to 5.3 kPa (or
40 mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial
partial pressure of O2, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of
values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response. However, when the
atmospheric pressure (and therefore the partial pressure of O2 in the ambient
air) falls to below 50-75% of its value at sea level, oxygen homeostasis is
given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis.[6] This switch-over occurs at
an elevation of about 2500 m (or about 8000 ft). If this switch occurs
relatively abruptly, the hyperpnea at high altitude will cause a severe fall in
the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, with a consequent_rise_in_the
pH_of_the_arterial_plasma. This is one contributor to high_altitude_sickness.
On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then
hypoxia may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.
There are oxygen sensors in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles. In response to
low partial pressures of oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexively
cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict.[27] (This is the exact opposite of
the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures
of O2 cause arteriolar vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the pulmonary
arterial_pressure_to_rise resulting in a much more even distribution of blood
flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level the pulmonary arterial
pressure is very low, with the result that the_tops_of_the_lungs_receive_far
less_blood_than_the_bases, which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is
only in the middle of the lungs that the blood_and_air_flow_to_the_alveoli_are
ideally_matched. At altitude this variation in the ventilation/perfusion_ratio
of alveoli from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all
the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more or less the physiologically ideal
manner. This is a further important contributor to the acclimatatization_to
high_altitudes and low oxygen pressures.
The kidneys measure the oxygen content (mmol O2/liter blood, rather than the
partial pressure of O2) of the arterial blood. When the oxygen content of the
blood is chronically low, as at high altitude, the oxygen-sensitive kidney
cells secrete erythropoietin (often known only by its abbreviated form as EPO)
[28] into the blood.[29] This hormone stimulates the red_bone_marrow to
increase its rate of red cell production, which leads to an increase in the
hematocrit of the blood, and a consequent increase in its oxygen carrying
capacity (due to the now high hemoglobin content of the blood). In other words,
at the same arterial partial pressure of O2, a person with a high hematocrit
carries more oxygen per liter of blood than a person with a lower hematocrit
does. High altitude dwellers therefore have higher hematocrits than sea-level
residents.[29][30]
**** Other functions of the lungs ****
*** Local defenses ***
Irritation of nerve endings within the nasal_passages or airways, can induce a
cough_reflex and sneezing. These responses cause air to be expelled forcefully
from the trachea or nose, respectively. In this manner, irritants caught in the
mucus which lines the respiratory tract are expelled or moved to the mouth
where they can be swallowed.[6] During coughing, contraction of the smooth
muscle in the airway walls narrows the trachea by pulling the ends of the
cartilage plates together and by pushing soft tissue into the lumen. This
increases the expired airflow rate to dislodge and remove any irritant particle
or mucus.
Respiratory_epithelium can secrete a variety of molecules that aid in the
defense of the lungs. These include secretory immunoglobulins (IgA),
collectins, defensins and other peptides and proteases, reactive_oxygen
species, and reactive_nitrogen_species. These secretions can act directly as
antimicrobials to help keep the airway free of infection. A variety of
chemokines and cytokines are also secreted that recruit the traditional immune
cells and others to the site of infections.
Surfactant immune function is primarily attributed to two proteins: SP-A and
SP-D. These proteins can bind to sugars on the surface of pathogens and thereby
opsonize them for uptake by phagocytes. It also regulates inflammatory
responses and interacts with the adaptive immune response. Surfactant
degradation or inactivation may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to lung
inflammation and infection.[31]
Most of the respiratory system is lined with mucous membranes that contain
mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue, which produces white_blood_cells such as
lymphocytes.
*** Prevention of alveolar collapse ***
Main article: Pulmonary_surfactant
The lungs make a surfactant, a surface-active lipoprotein complex
(phospholipoprotein) formed by type_II_alveolar_cells. It floats on the surface
of the thin watery layer which lines the insides of the alveoli, reducing the
water's surface tension.
The surface tension of a watery surface (the water-air interface) tends to make
that surface shrink.[6] When that surface is curved as it is in the alveoli of
the lungs, the shrinkage of the surface decreases the diameter of the alveoli.
The more acute the curvature of the water-air interface the_greater_the
tendency_for_the_alveolus_to_collapse.[6] This has three effects. Firstly the
surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during
inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or non-compliant). Surfactant reduces
the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more compliant, or less
stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the diameters of the alveoli
increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli
have a greater_tendency_to_collapse (i.e. cause atelectasis) at the end of
exhalation that at the end of inhalation. Since surfactant floats on the watery
surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink
during exhalation.[6] This causes them to have a greater surface tension-
lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the
end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced). The
tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of
exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the
curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung
tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels,
and keeps the alveoli dry.[6][32]
Pre-term_babies who are unable to manufacture surfactant have lungs that tend
to collapse each time they breathe out. Unless treated, this condition, called
respiratory_distress_syndrome, is fatal. Basic scientific experiments, carried
out using cells from chicken lungs, support the potential for using steroids as
a means of furthering development of type II alveolar cells.[33] In fact, once
a premature_birth is threatened, every effort is made to delay the birth, and a
series of steroid injections is frequently administered to the mother during
this delay in an effort to promote lung maturation.[34]
*** Contributions to whole body functions ***
The lung vessels contain a fibrinolytic_system that dissolves clots that may
have arrived in the pulmonary circulation by embolism, often from the deep
veins in the legs. They also release a variety of substances that enter the
systemic arterial blood, and they remove other substances from the systemic
venous blood that reach them via the pulmonary artery. Some prostaglandins are
removed from the circulation, while others are synthesized in the lungs and
released into the blood when lung tissue is stretched.
The lungs activate one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide
angiotensin_I is converted to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide,
angiotensin_II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other
tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II
also has a direct effect on arteriolar_walls, causing arteriolar
vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial_blood_pressure.[35] Large
amounts of the angiotensin-converting_enzyme responsible for this activation
are located on the surfaces of the endothelial_cells of the alveolar
capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin. Circulation
time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the
angiotensin I reaching the lungs is converted to angiotensin II in a single
trip through the capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified on the
surface of the pulmonary endothelial cells.
*** Vocalization ***
The movement of gas through the larynx, pharynx and mouth allows humans to
speak, or phonate. Vocalization, or singing, in birds occurs via the syrinx, an
organ located at the base of the trachea. The vibration of air flowing across
the larynx (vocal_cords), in humans, and the syrinx, in birds, results in
sound. Because of this, gas movement is vital for communication purposes.
*** Temperature control ***
Panting in dogs, cats, birds and some other animals provides a means of
reducing body temperature, by evaporating saliva in the mouth (instead of
evaporating sweat on the skin).
**** Clinical significance ****
Disorders_of_the_respiratory_system can be classified into several general
groups:
    * Airway obstructive conditions (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis, asthma)
    * Pulmonary restrictive conditions (e.g., fibrosis, sarcoidosis, alveolar
      damage, pleural_effusion)
    * Vascular diseases (e.g., pulmonary_edema, pulmonary_embolism, pulmonary
      hypertension)
    * Infectious, environmental and other "diseases" (e.g., pneumonia,
      tuberculosis, asbestosis, particulate_pollutants)
    * Primary cancers (e.g. bronchial_carcinoma, mesothelioma)
    * Secondary cancers (e.g. cancers that originated elsewhere in the body,
      but have seeded themselves in the lungs)
    * Insufficient surfactant (e.g. respiratory_distress_syndrome in pre-term
      babies) .
Disorders of the respiratory system are usually treated by a pulmonologist and
respiratory_therapist.
Where there is an inability to breathe or an insufficiency in breathing a
medical_ventilator may be used.
***** Exceptional mammals *****
**** Horses ****
Main article: Respiratory_system_of_the_horse
Horses are obligate_nasal_breathers which means that they are different from
many other mammals because they do not have the option of breathing through
their mouths and must take in air through their noses.
**** Elephants ****
The elephant is the only mammal known to have no pleural_space. Rather, the
parietal and visceral_pleura are both composed of dense connective_tissue and
joined to each other via loose connective tissue.[36] This lack of a pleural
space, along with an unusually thick diaphragm, are thought to be evolutionary
adaptations allowing the elephant to remain underwater for long periods of time
while breathing through its trunk which emerges as a snorkel.[37]
In the elephant the lungs are attached to the diaphragm and breathing relies
mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage.[38]

Fig. 18 Inhalation-exhalation cycle in birds.
The respiratory system of birds differs significantly from that found in
mammals. Firstly, they have rigid lungs which do not expand and contract during
the breathing cycle. Instead an extensive system of air_sacs (Fig. 15)
distributed throughout their bodies act as the bellows drawing environmental
air into the sacs, and expelling the spent air after it has passed through the
lungs (Fig. 18).[39] Birds also do not have diaphragms or pleural_cavities.
Bird lungs are smaller than those in mammals of comparable size, but the air
sacs account for 15% of the total body volume, compared to the 7% devoted to
the alveoli which act as the bellows in mammals.[40]
Inhalation and exhalation are brought about by alternately increasing and
decreasing the volume of the entire thoraco-abdominal cavity (or coelom) using
both their abdominal and costal muscles.[41][42][43] During inhalation the
muscles attached to the vertebral ribs (Fig. 17) contract angling them forwards
and outwards. This pushes the sternal ribs, to which they are attached at
almost right angles, downwards and forwards, taking the sternum (with its
prominent keel) in the same direction (Fig. 17). This increases both the
vertical and transverse diameters of thoracic portion of the trunk. The forward
and downward movement of, particularly, the posterior end of the sternum pulls
the abdominal wall downwards, increasing the volume of that region of the trunk
as well.[41] The increase in volume of the entire trunk cavity reduces the air
pressure in all the thoraco-abdominal air sacs, causing them to fill with air
as described below.
During exhalation the external oblique muscle which is attached to the sternum
and vertebral ribs anteriorly, and to the pelvis (pubis and ilium in Fig. 17)
posteriorly (forming part of the abdominal wall) reverses the inhalatory
movement, while compressing the abdominal contents, thus increasing the
pressure in all the air sacs. Air is therefore expelled from the respiratory
system in the act of exhalation.[41]
Fig. 19 The cross-current respiratory gas exchanger in the lungs of birds. Air
is forced from the air sacs unidirectionally (from right to left in the
diagram) through the parabronchi. The pulmonary capillaries surround the
parabronchi in the manner shown (blood flowing from below the parabronchus to
above it in the diagram).[41][44] Blood or air with a high oxygen content is
shown in red; oxygen-poor air or blood is shown in various shades of purple-
blue.
During inhalation air enters the trachea via the nostrils and mouth, and
continues to just beyond the syrinx at which point the trachea branches into
two primary_bronchi, going to the two lungs (Fig. 16). The primary bronchi
enter the lungs to become the intrapulmonary bronchi, which give off a set of
parallel branches called ventrobronchi and, a little further on, an equivalent
set of dorsobronchi (Fig. 16).[41] The ends of the intrapulmonary bronchi
discharge air into the posterior air sacs at the caudal end of the bird. Each
pair of dorso-ventrobronchi is connected by a large number of parallel
microscopic air capillaries (or parabronchi) where gas_exchange occurs
(Fig. 16).[41] As the bird inhales, tracheal air flows through the
intrapulmonary bronchi into the posterior air sacs, as well as into the
dorsobronchi, but not into the ventrobronchi (Fig. 18). This is due to the
bronchial architecture which directs the inhaled air away from the openings of
the ventrobronchi, into the continuation of the intrapulmonary bronchus towards
the dorsobronchi and posterior air sacs.[45][46][47] From the dorsobronchi the
inhaled air flows through the parabronchi (and therefore the gas exchanger) to
the ventrobronchi from where the air can only escape into the expanding
anterior air sacs. So, during inhalation, both the posterior and anterior air
sacs expand,[41] the posterior air sacs filling with fresh inhaled air, while
the anterior air sacs fill with "spent" (oxygen-poor) air that has just passed
through the lungs.
During exhalation the pressure in the posterior air sacs (which were filled
with fresh air during inhalation) increases due to the contraction of the
oblique muscle described above. The aerodynamics of the interconnecting
openings from the posterior air sacs to the dorsobronchi and intrapulmonary
bronchi ensures that the air leaves these sacs in the direction of the lungs
(via the dorsobronchi), rather than returning down the intrapulmonary bronchi
(Fig. 18).[45][47] From the dorsobronchi the fresh air from the posterior air
sacs flows through the parabronchi (in the same direction as occurred during
inhalation) into ventrobronchi. The air passages connecting the ventrobronchi
and anterior air sacs to the intrapulmonary bronchi direct the "spent", oxygen
poor air from these two organs to the trachea from where it escapes to the
exterior.[41] Oxygenated air therefore flows constantly (during the entire
breathing cycle) in a single direction through the parabronchi.[48]
The blood flow through the bird lung is at right angles to the flow of air
through the parabronchi, forming a cross-current flow exchange system
(Fig. 19).[39][41][44] The partial_pressure_of_oxygen in the parabronchi
declines along their lengths as O2 diffuses into the blood. The blood
capillaries leaving the exchanger near the entrance of airflow take up more O2
than do the capillaries leaving near the exit end of the parabronchi. When the
contents of all capillaries mix, the final partial pressure of oxygen of the
mixed pulmonary venous blood is higher than that of the exhaled air,[41][44]
but is nevertheless less than half that of the inhaled air,[41] thus achieving
roughly the same systemic arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen as mammals
do_with_their_bellows-type_lungs.[41]
The trachea is an area of dead_space: the oxygen-poor air it contains at the
end of exhalation is the first air to re-enter the posterior air sacs and
lungs. In comparison to the mammalian_respiratory_tract, the dead space volume
in a bird is, on average, 4.5 times greater than it is in mammals of the same
size.[40][41] Birds with long necks will inevitably have long tracheae, and
must therefore take deeper breaths than mammals do to make allowances for their
greater dead space volumes. In some birds (e.g. the whooper_swan, Cygnus
cygnus, the white_spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia, the whooping_crane, Grus
americana, and the helmeted_curassow, Pauxi pauxi) the trachea, which some
cranes can be 1.5 m long,[41] is coiled back and forth within the body,
drastically increasing the dead space ventilation.[41] The purpose of this
extraordinary feature is unknown.

The anatomical_structure of the lungs is less complex in reptiles than in
mammals, with reptiles lacking the very extensive airway tree structure found
in mammalian lungs. Gas_exchange in reptiles still occurs in alveoli however.
[39] Reptiles do not possess a diaphragm. Thus, breathing occurs via a change
in the volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of
intercostal_muscles in all reptiles except turtles. In turtles, contraction of
specific pairs of flank muscles governs inhalation and exhalation.[49]
***** Amphibians *****
Main article: Amphibian_Â§ Respiratory_system
Both the lungs and the skin serve as respiratory organs in amphibians. The
ventilation of the lungs in amphibians relies on positive_pressure_ventilation.
Muscles lower the floor of the oral cavity, enlarging it and drawing in air
through the nostrils into the oral_cavity. With the nostrils and mouth closed,
the floor of the oral cavity is then pushed up, which forces air down the
trachea into the lungs. The skin of these animals is highly vascularized and
moist, with moisture maintained via secretion of mucus from specialised cells,
and is involved in cutaneous_respiration. While the lungs are of primary organs
for gas exchange between the blood and the environmental air (when out of the
water), the skin's unique properties aid rapid gas exchange when amphibians are
submerged in oxygen-rich water.[50] Some amphibians have gills, either in the
early stages of their development (e.g. tadpoles of frogs), while others retain
them into adulthood (e.g. some salamanders).[39]
***** Fish *****
Main article: Fish_physiology_Â§ Respiration
Fig. 21. The operculum or gill cover of a pike has been pulled open to expose
the gill_arches bearing filaments.
Fig. 22. A comparison between the operations and effects of a cocurrent and a
countercurrent flow exchange system is depicted by the upper and lower diagrams
respectively. In both it is assumed that red has a higher value (e.g. of
temperature or the partial pressure of a gas) than blue and that the property
being transported in the channels therefore flows from red to blue. In fish a
countercurrent flow (lower diagram) of blood and water in the gills is used to
extract oxygen from the environment.[51][52][53]
Fig. 23 The respiratory mechanism in bony fish. The inhalatory process is on
the left, the exhalatory process on the right. The movement of water is
indicated by the blue arrows.
Oxygen is poorly soluble in water. Fully aerated fresh_water therefore contains
only 8â10 ml O2/liter compared to the O2 concentration of 210 ml/liter in the
air at sea level.[54] Furthermore, the coefficient_of_diffusion (i.e. the rate
at which a substances diffuses from a region of high concentration to one of
low concentration, under standard conditions) of the respiratory gases is
typically_10,000_faster_in_air_than_in_water.[54] Thus oxygen, for instance,
has a diffusion coefficient of 17.6 mm2/s in air, but only 0.0021 mm2/s in
water.[55][56][57][58] The corresponding values for carbon dioxide are 16 mm2/
s in air and 0.0016 mm2/s in water.[57][58] This means that when oxygen is
taken up from the water in contact with a gas exchanger, it is replaced
considerably more slowly by the oxygen from the oxygen-rich regions small
distances away from the exchanger than would have occurred in air. Fish have
developed gills deal with these problems. Gills are specialized organs
containing filaments, which further divide into lamellae. The lamellae contain
a dense thin_walled_capillary_network that exposes a large gas exchange surface
area to the very large volumes of water passing over them.[59]
Gills use a countercurrent_exchange system that increases the efficiency of
oxygen-uptake from the water.[51][52][53] Fresh oxygenated water taken in
through the mouth is uninterruptedly "pumped" through the gills in one
direction, while the blood in the lamellae flows in the opposite direction,
creating the countercurrent blood and water flow (Fig. 22), on which the fish's
survival depends.[53]
Water is drawn in through the mouth by closing the operculum (gill cover), and
enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge,
producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over
the gills.[53] The mouth cavity then contracts inducing the closure of the
passive oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth
(Fig. 23).[53][60] The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills,
while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the
opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the
inhalatory phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of
the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill
chambers act alternately as suction pump and pressure pump to maintain a steady
flow of water over the gills in one direction.[53] Since the blood in the
lamellar capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the
consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration
gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each
capillary (lower diagram in Fig. 22). Oxygen is therefore able to continually
diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its
gradient into the water.[52] Although countercurrent exchange systems
theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas from one
side of the exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the
water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.[51]
In certain active pelagic sharks, water passes through the mouth and over the
gills while they are moving, in a process known as "ram ventilation".[61] While
at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills, as most bony fish do, to
ensure that oxygenated water continues to flow over their gills. But a small
number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and
must swim without rest. These species are obligate ram ventilators and would
presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true
of some pelagic bony fish species.[62]
There are a few fish that can obtain oxygen for brief periods of time from air
swallowed from above the surface of the water. Thus Lungfish possess one or two
lungs, and the labyrinth_fish have developed a special "labyrinth organ", which
characterizes this suborder of fish. The labyrinth organ is a much-folded
suprabranchial accessory breathing_organ. It is formed by a vascularized
expansion of the epibranchial bone of the first gill arch, and is used for
respiration in air.[63]
This organ allows labyrinth fish to take in oxygen directly from the air,
instead of taking it from the water in which they reside through use of gills.
The labyrinth organ helps the oxygen in the inhaled air to be absorbed into the
bloodstream. As a result, labyrinth fish can survive for a short period of time
out of water, as they can inhale the air around them, provided they stay moist.
Labyrinth fish are not born with functional labyrinth organs. The development
of the organ is gradual and most juvenile labyrinth fish breathe entirely with
their gills and develop the labyrinth organs when they grow older.[63]
***** Invertebrates *****
**** Arthropods ****
See also: Spiracle_Â§ Arthropods
Some species of crab use a respiratory organ called a branchiostegal_lung.[64]
Its gill-like structure increases the surface area for gas exchange which is
more suited to taking oxygen from the air than from water. Some of the smallest
spiders and mites can breathe simply by exchanging gas through the surface of
the body. Larger spiders, scorpions and other arthropods use a primitive book
lung.
*** Insects ***
Main article: Respiratory_system_of_insects
Most insects breath passively through their spiracles (special openings in the
exoskeleton) and the air reaches every part of the body by means of a series of
smaller and smaller tubes called 'trachaea' when their diameters are relatively
large, and 'tracheoles' when their diameters are very small. The tracheoles
make contact with individual cells throughout the body.[39] They are partially
filled with fluid, which can be withdrawn from the individual tracheoles when
the tissues, such as muscles, are active and have a high demand for oxygen,
bringing the air closer to the active cells.[39] This is probably brought about
by the buildup of lactic acid in the active muscles causing an osmotic
gradient, moving the water out of the tracheoles and into the active cells.
Diffusion of gases is effective over small distances but not over larger ones,
this is one of the reasons insects are all relatively small. Insects which do
not have spiracles and trachaea, such as some Collembola, breathe directly
through their skins, also by diffusion of gases.[65]
The number of spiracles an insect has is variable between species, however they
always come in pairs, one on each side of the body, and usually one pair per
segment. Some of the Diplura have eleven, with four pairs on the thorax, but in
most of the ancient forms of insects, such as Dragonflies and Grasshoppers
there are two thoracic and eight abdominal spiracles. However, in most of the
remaining insects there are fewer. It is at the level of the tracheoles that
oxygen is delivered to the cells for respiration.
Insects were once believed to exchange gases with the environment continuously
by the simple_diffusion of gases into the tracheal system. More recently,
however, large variation in insect ventilatory patterns have been documented
and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not
demonstrate continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of
the spiracles. Others, however, utilize muscular_contraction of the abdomen
along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate cyclical
gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most
extreme form of these patterns is termed discontinuous_gas_exchange cycles.[66]
**** Molluscs ****
Main article: Respiratory_system_of_gastropods
Molluscs generally possess gills that allow gas exchange between the aqueous
environment and their circulatory systems. These animals also possess a heart
that pumps blood containing hemocyanin as its oxygen-capturing molecule.[39]
Hence, this respiratory system is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The
respiratory_system_of_gastropods can include either gills or a lung.
***** Plants *****
Main article: Photosynthesis
Plants use carbon_dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis, and exhale
oxygen gas as waste. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 (carbon
dioxide) and 6 H2O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C6H12O6
(glucose) and 6 O2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms
as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight.[67] Respiration is the
opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions
in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with
oxygen forming CO2 which is easily removed from both the cells and the
organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and
oxidative_metabolism to use it.
Plant respiration is limited by the process of diffusion. Plants take in carbon
dioxide through holes, known as stomata, that can open and close on the
undersides of their leaves and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most
plants require some oxygen for catabolic processes (break-down reactions that
release energy). But the quantity of O2 used per hour is small as they are not
involved in activities that require high rates of aerobic metabolism. Their
requirement for air, however, is very high as they need CO2 for photosynthesis,
which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1 g of
glucose requires the removal of all the CO2 from at least 18.7 liters of air at
sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably
greater volumes of air to be used.[67][68]
