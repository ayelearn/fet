IUPAC definition
polymerization: The process of converting a monomer or a mixture of monomers
into a polymer.[1]
An example of alkene polymerization, in which each styrene monomer's double
bond reforms as a single bond plus a bond to another styrene monomer. The
product is polystyrene.
In polymer_chemistry, polymerization is a process of reacting monomer_molecules
together in a chemical_reaction to form polymer chains or three-dimensional
networks.[2][3][4] There are many forms of polymerization and different systems
exist to categorize them.

In chemical_compounds, polymerization can occur via a variety of reaction
mechanisms that vary in complexity due to the functional_groups present in the
reactants[4] and their inherent steric_effects. In more straightforward
polymerizations, alkenes form polymers through relatively simple radical
reactions; in contrast, reactions involving substitution at a carbonyl_group
require more complex synthesis due to the way in which reactants polymerize.[4]
Alkanes can also be polymerized, but only with the help of strong acids.[5]
As alkenes can polymerize in somewhat straightforward radical reactions, they
form useful compounds such as polyethylene and polyvinyl_chloride (PVC),[4]
which are produced in high tonnages each year[4] due to their usefulness in
manufacturing processes of commercial products, such as piping, insulation and
packaging. In general, polymers such as PVC are referred to as "homopolymers,"
as they consist of repeated long chains or structures of the same monomer unit,
whereas polymers that consist of more than one monomer unit are referred to as
copolymers (or co-polymers).[6]
Other monomer units, such as formaldehyde hydrates or simple aldehydes, are
able to polymerize themselves at quite low temperatures (ca. â80 Â°C) to form
trimers;[4] molecules consisting of 3 monomer units, which can cyclize to form
ring cyclic structures, or undergo further reactions to form tetramers,[4] or 4
monomer-unit compounds. Such small polymers are referred to as oligomers[4].
Generally, because formaldehyde is an exceptionally reactive electrophile it
allows nucleophilic addition of hemiacetal intermediates, which are in general
short-lived and relatively unstable "mid-stage" compounds that react with other
molecules present to form more stable polymeric compounds.
Polymerization that is not sufficiently moderated and proceeds at a fast rate
can be very hazardous. This phenomenon is known as hazardous_polymerization and
can cause fires and explosions.
***** Step-growth[edit] *****
Main article: Step-growth_polymerization
There are two main classes of polymerization reaction mechanisms: step-growth
and chain-growth. In step-growth (or step) polymerization, each step may
involve the combination of two polymer molecules of any lengths to form a
longer polymer molecule. The average_molar_mass increases slowly and long
chains are formed only late in the reaction.[7][8].
Step-growth polymers are formed by independent reaction steps between
functional groups of monomer units, usually containing heteroatoms such as
nitrogen or oxygen. Most step-growth polymers are also classified as
condensation_polymers, since a small molecule such as water is lost when the
polymer chain is lengthened. For example, polyester chains grow by reaction of
alcohol and carboxylic_acid groups to form ester links with loss of water.
However, there are exceptions; for example polyurethanes are step-growth
polymers formed from isocyanate and alcohol bifunctional monomers) without loss
of water or other small molecule, and are classified as addition_polymers
rather than condensation polymers.
Step-growth polymers increase in molecular weight at a very slow rate at lower
conversions and reach moderately high molecular weights only at very high
conversion (i.e., >95%).
***** Chain-growth[edit] *****
Main article: Chain-growth_polymerization
In chain-growth (or chain) polymerization, the only chain-extension reaction
step is the addition of a monomer to a growing chain with an active center such
as a free_radical or ion. Once the growth of a chain is initiated by formation
of an active center, chain propagation is usually rapid by addition of a
sequence of monomers. Long chains are formed from the beginning of the
reaction.[7][8]
Chain-growth polymerization (or addition polymerization) involves the linking
together of molecules incorporating double or triple carbon-carbon bonds. These
unsaturated monomers (the identical molecules that make up the polymers) have
extra internal bonds that are able to break and link up with other monomers to
form a repeating chain, whose backbone typically contains only carbon atoms.
Chain-growth polymerization is involved in the manufacture of polymers such as
polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl_chloride (PVC). A special case of
chain-growth polymerization leads to living_polymerization.
In the radical_polymerization of ethylene, its Ï_bond is broken, and the two
electrons rearrange to create a new propagating_center like the one that
attacked it. The form this propagating center takes depends on the specific
type of addition mechanism. There are several mechanisms through which this can
be initiated. The free_radical mechanism is one of the first methods to be
used. Free radicals are very reactive atoms or molecules that have unpaired
electrons. Taking the polymerization of ethylene as an example, the free
radical mechanism can be divided into three stages: chain_initiation, chain
propagation, and chain_termination.
Polymerization of ethylene
Free radical addition polymerization of ethylene must take place at high
temperatures and pressures, approximately 300 Â°C and 2000 atm. While most
other free radical polymerizations do not require such extreme temperatures and
pressures, they do tend to lack control. One effect of this lack of control is
a high degree of branching. Also, as termination occurs randomly, when two
chains collide, it is impossible to control the length of individual chains. A
newer method of polymerization similar to free radical, but allowing more
control involves the ZieglerâNatta_catalyst, especially with respect to
polymer_branching.
Other forms of chain growth polymerization include cationic_addition
polymerization and anionic_addition_polymerization. While not used to a large
extent in industry yet due to stringent reaction conditions such as lack of
water and oxygen, these methods provide ways to polymerize some monomers that
cannot be polymerized by free radical methods such as polypropylene. Cationic
and anionic mechanisms are also more ideally suited for living_polymerizations,
although free radical living polymerizations have also been developed.
Esters of acrylic_acid contain a carbon-carbon double bond which is conjugated
to an ester group. This allows the possibility of both types of polymerization
mechanism. An acrylic ester by itself can undergo chain-growth polymerization
to form a homopolymer with a carbon-carbon backbone, such as poly(methyl
methacrylate). Also, however, certain acrylic esters can react with diamine
monomers by nucleophilic_conjugate_addition of amine groups to acrylic C=C
bonds. In this case the polymerization proceeds by step-growth and the products
are poly(beta-amino ester) copolymers, with backbones containing nitrogen (as
amine) and oxygen (as ester) as well as carbon.[9]
**** Physical polymer reaction engineering[edit] ****
To produce a high-molecular-weight, uniform product, various methods are
employed to better control the initiation, propagation, and termination rates
during chain polymerization and also to remove excess concentrated heat during
these exothermic reactions compared to polymerization of the pure monomer (also
referred to as bulk polymerization). These include emulsion_polymerization,
solution_polymerization, suspension_polymerization, and precipitation
polymerization. Although the polymer polydispersity and molecular weight may be
improved, these methods may introduce additional processing requirements to
isolate the product from a solvent.
**** Photopolymerization[edit] ****
Main article: Photopolymer
Most photopolymerization reactions are chain-growth polymerizations which are
initiated by the absorption of visible[10] or ultraviolet light. The light may
be absorbed either directly by the reactant monomer (direct
photopolymerization), or else by a photosensitizer which absorbs the light and
then transfers energy to the monomer. In general only the initiation step
differs from that of the ordinary thermal polymerization of the same monomer;
subsequent propagation, termination and chain transfer steps are unchanged.[11]
In step-growth photopolymerization, absorption of light triggers an addition
(or condensation) reaction between two comonomers that do not react without
light. A propagation cycle is not initiated because each growth step requires
the assistance of light.[12]
Photopolymerization can be used as a photographic or printing process, because
polymerization only occurs in regions which have been exposed to light.
Unreacted monomer can be removed from unexposed regions, leaving a relief
polymeric image.[11] Several forms of 3D_printingâincluding layer-by-layer
stereolithography and two-photon_absorption_3D_photopolymerizationâuse
photopolymerization. [13].

Multiphoton polymerization using single pulses have also been demonstrated for
fabrication of complex structures using a digital_micromirror_device.[14]
