For other uses, see Pattern_(disambiguation).
Tilings, such as these from Igreja_de_CampanhÃ£, Porto, Portugal, are visual
patterns used for decoration.
A pattern is a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract
ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A
geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically
repeated like a wallpaper design.
Any of the senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns
in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct
observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in
nature and in art. Visual patterns_in_nature are often chaotic, never exactly
repeating, and often involve fractals. Natural patterns include spirals,
meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks, and those created by symmetries of
rotation and reflection. Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure;[1]
indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output
of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories
explain and predict regularities in the world.
In art and architecture, decorations or visual_motifs may be combined and
repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In
computer science, a software_design_pattern is a known solution to a class of
problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a template used to create
any number of similar garments.

***** Nature[edit] *****
Main article: Patterns_in_nature
Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including symmetries, trees
and other structures with a fractal dimension, spirals, meanders, waves, foams,
tilings, cracks and stripes.[2]
**** Symmetry[edit] ****
Snowflake sixfold_symmetry
Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move usually have
bilateral or mirror_symmetry as this favours movement.[3] Plants often have
radial or rotational_symmetry, as do many flowers, as well as animals which are
largely static as adults, such as sea_anemones. Fivefold symmetry is found in
the echinoderms, including starfish, sea_urchins, and sea_lilies.[4]
Among non-living things, snowflakes have striking sixfold_symmetry: each flake
is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its
crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms.[5] Crystals have a highly
specific set of possible crystal_symmetries; they can be cubic or octahedral,
but cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals).[6]
**** Spirals[edit] ****
Aloe_polyphylla phyllotaxis
Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including molluscs such
as the nautilus, and in the phyllotaxis of many plants, both of leaves
spiralling around stems, and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such
as the sunflower and fruit structures like the pineapple.[7]
**** Chaos, turbulence, meanders and complexity[edit] ****
Vortex_street turbulence
Chaos_theory predicts that while the laws of physics are deterministic, there
are events and patterns in nature that never exactly repeat because extremely
small differences in starting conditions can lead to widely differing outcomes.
[8]. The patterns in nature tend to be static due to dissipation on the
emergence process, but when there is interplay between injection of energy and
dissipation there can arise a complex dynamic[9]. Many natural patterns are
shaped by this complexity, including vortex_streets[10], other effects of
turbulent flow such as meanders in rivers.[11] or nonlinear interaction of the
system [12]
**** Waves, dunes[edit] ****
Dune ripple
Waves are disturbances that carry energy as they move. Mechanical_waves
propagate through a medium â air or water, making it oscillate as they pass
by.[13] Wind_waves are surface_waves that create the chaotic patterns of the
sea. As they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly,
as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of dunes.[14]
**** Bubbles, foam[edit] ****
Foam of soap_bubbles
Foams obey Plateau's_laws, which require films to be smooth and continuous, and
to have a constant average_curvature. Foam and bubble patterns occur widely in
nature, for example in radiolarians, sponge spicules, and the skeletons of
silicoflagellates and sea_urchins.[15][16]
**** Cracks[edit] ****
Shrinkage Cracks
Cracks form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic
materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials. Thus the pattern of cracks
indicates whether the material is elastic or not. Cracking patterns are
widespread in nature, for example in rocks, mud, tree bark and the glazes of
old paintings and ceramics.[17]
**** Spots, stripes[edit] ****
Giant_pufferfish skin
Main article: Pattern_formation
Alan_Turing,[18] and later the mathematical biologist James_D._Murray[19] and
other scientists, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or
striped patterns, for example in the skin of mammals or the plumage of birds: a
reaction-diffusion system involving two counter-acting chemical mechanisms, one
that activates and one that inhibits a development, such as of dark pigment in
the skin.[20] These spatiotemporal_patterns slowly drift, the animals'
appearance changing imperceptibly as Turing predicted.
***** Art and architecture[edit] *****
Elaborate ceramic tiles at Topkapi_Palace
Further information: Mathematics_and_art and Mathematics_and_architecture
**** Tilings[edit] ****
Further information: Tessellation and Tile
In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way "organizes
surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner." At its simplest, a
pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a painting,
drawing, tapestry, ceramic tiling or carpet, but a pattern need not necessarily
repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing "skeleton" in the
artwork.[21] In mathematics, a tessellation is the tiling of a plane using one
or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps
and no gaps.[22]
**** In architecture[edit] ****
Patterns in architecture: the Virupaksha temple at Hampi has a fractal-like
structure where the parts resemble the whole.
Main articles: Pattern_(architecture) and Mathematics_and_architecture
In architecture, motifs are repeated in various ways to form patterns. Most
simply, structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically
(see leading picture). Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural
elements such as columns, pediments, and lintels.[23] Repetitions need not be
identical; for example, temples in South India have a roughly pyramidal form,
where elements of the pattern repeat in a fractal-like way at different sizes.
[24]
***** Science and mathematics[edit] *****
Fractal model of a fern illustrating self-similarity
Mathematics is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern", in the sense of rules
that can be applied wherever needed.[25] For example, any sequence of numbers
that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern.
Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns.[26]
**** Fractals[edit] ****
Some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, and among these are those
that explain patterns_in_nature including the mathematics of symmetry, waves,
meanders, and fractals. Fractals are mathematical patterns that are scale
invariant. This means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how
closely you look at it. Self-similarity is found in fractals. Examples of
natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape
regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can
appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their
formation can be simple (e.g. Lindenmayer_systems describing tree shapes).[27]
In pattern_theory, devised by Ulf_Grenander, mathematicians attempt to describe
the world in terms of patterns. The goal is to lay out the world in a more
computationally friendly manner.[28]
In the broadest sense, any regularity that can be explained by a scientific
theory is a pattern. As in mathematics, science can be taught as a set of
patterns.[29]
***** Computer science[edit] *****
In computer science, a software_design_pattern, in the sense of a template, is
a general solution to a problem in programming. A design pattern provides a
reusable architectural outline that may speed the development of many computer
programs.[30]
***** Fashion[edit] *****
Main article: Pattern_(sewing)
In fashion, the pattern is a template, a technical two-dimensional tool used to
create any number of identical garments. It can be considered as a means of
translating from the drawing to the real garment.[31]
