Biocompatibility is related to the behavior of biomaterials in various
contexts. The term refers to the ability of a material to perform with an
appropriate host response in a specific situation.[1] The ambiguity of the term
reflects the ongoing development of insights into how biomaterials interact
with the human_body and eventually how those interactions determine the
clinical success of a medical_device (such as pacemaker, hip_replacement or
stent). Modern medical devices and prostheses are often made of more than one
material so it might not always be sufficient to talk about the
biocompatibility of a specific material.[2]
Since the immune_response and repair functions in the body are so complicated
it is not adequate to describe the biocompatibility of a single material in
relation to a single cell type or tissue. Sometimes one hears of
biocompatibility testing that is a large battery of in_vitro test[3] that is
used in accordance with ISO_10993 (or other similar standards) to determine if
a certain material (or rather biomedical product) is biocompatible. These tests
do not determine the biocompatibility of a material,[4] but they constitute an
important step towards the animal_testing and finally clinical_trials that will
determine the biocompatibility of the material in a given application, and thus
medical_devices such as implants or drug_delivery_devices[5].
IUPAC definition
Biocompatibility (biomedical therapy): Ability of a material to perform with an
appropriate host response in a specific application.[6][a]
Biocompatibility: Ability to be in contact with a living system without
producing an adverse effect.[6]

***** History[edit] *****
The word biocompatibility seems to have been mentioned for the first time in
peer-review journals and meetings in 1970 by RJ Hegyeli (Amer Chem Soc Annual
Meeting abstract) and CA Homsy et al. (J Macromol Sci Chem A4:3,615, 1970). It
took almost two decades before it began to be commonly used in scientific
literature (see the graph below).
Recently Williams (again) has been trying to reevaluate the current knowledge
status regarding what factors determine clinical success. Doing so notes that
an implant may not always have to be positively bioactive but it must not do
any harm (either locally or systemically) (Williams, 2008).
***** Five definitions of biocompatibility[edit] *****
   1. "The quality of not having toxic or injurious effects on biological
      systems".[7]
   2. "The ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response
      in a specific application", Williams' definition.[8]
   3. "Comparison of the tissue response produced through the close association
      of the implanted candidate material to its implant site within the host
      animal to that tissue response recognised and established as suitable
      with control materials" - ASTM
   4. "Refers to the ability of a biomaterial to perform its desired function
      with respect to a medical therapy, without eliciting any undesirable
      local or systemic effects in the recipient or beneficiary of that
      therapy, but generating the most appropriate beneficial cellular or
      tissue response in that specific situation, and optimising the clinically
      relevant performance of that therapy".[9]
   5. "Biocompatibility is the capability of a prosthesis implanted in the body
      to exist in harmony with tissue without causing deleterious changes".[10]
***** Comments on the above five definitions[edit] *****
   1. The Dorland Medical definition not recommended according to Williams
      Dictionary since it only defines biocompatibility as the absence of host
      response and does not include any desired or positive interactions
      between the host tissue and the biomaterials.
   2. This is also called the âWilliams definitionâ or âWilliamâs
      definitionâ.[11] It was defined in the European_Society_for
      Biomaterials Consensus Conference I and can more easily be found in
      âThe Williams Dictionary of Biomaterialsâ.
   3. The ASTM is not recommended according to Williams Dictionary since it
      only refers to local tissue responses, in animal models.
   4. The fourth is an expansion or rather more precise version of the first
      definition noting both that low toxicity and the one should be aware of
      the different demands between various medical applications of the same
      material.
   5. [[icon]] This section is empty. You can help by adding_to_it. (August

All these definitions deal with materials and not with devices. This is a
drawback since many medical devices are made of more than one material. Much of
the pre-clinical_testing of the materials is not conducted on the devices but
rather the material itself. But at some stage the testing will have to include
the device since the shape, geometry and surface treatment etc. of the device
will also affect its biocompatibility.
**** âBiocompatibleâ[edit] ****
In the literature, one quite often stumbles upon the adjective form,
âbiocompatibleâ. However, according to Williamsâ definition, this does
not make any sense because biocompatibility is contextual, i.e. much more than
just the material itself will determine the clinical outcome of the medical
device of which the biomaterial is a part. This also points to one of the
weaknesses with the current definition because a medical device usually is made
of more than one material.
Metallic glasses based on magnesium with zinc and calcium addition are tested
as the potential biocompatible metallic biomaterials for biodegradable medical
implants[12]
**** Suggested sub-definitions[edit] ****
The scope of the first definition is so wide that D Williams tried to find
suitable subgroups of applications in order to be able to make more narrow
definitions. In the MDT article from 2003 the chosen supgroups and their
definitions were:
  Biocompatibility of long-term implanted_devices
      The biocompatibility of a long-term implantable medical device refers to
      the ability of the device to perform its intended function, with the
      desired degree of incorporation in the host, without eliciting any
      undesirable local or systemic effects in that host.
  Biocompatibility of short-term implantable devices
      The biocompatibility of a medical device that is intentionally placed
      within the cardiovascular system for transient diagnostic or therapeutic
      purposes refers to the ability of the device to carry out its intended
      function within flowing blood, with minimal interaction between device
      and blood that adversely affects device performance, and without inducing
      uncontrolled activation of cellular or plasma protein cascades.
  Biocompatibility of tissue-engineering products
      The biocompatibility of a scaffold or matrix for a tissue-engineering
      products refers to the ability to perform as a substrate that will
      support the appropriate cellular activity, including the facilitation of
      molecular and mechanical signalling systems, in order to optimise tissue
      regeneration, without eliciting any undesirable effects in those cells,
      or inducing any undesirable local or systemic responses in the eventual
      host.
In these definitions the notion of biocompatibility is related to devices
rather than to materials as compared to top three definitions. There was a
consensus conference on biomaterial definitions in Sorrento September 15â16,
2005.[13]
