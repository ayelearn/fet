Waveâparticle duality is the concept in quantum_mechanics that every particle
or quantum entity may be partly described in terms not only of particles, but
also of waves. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts "particle"
or "wave" to fully describe the behaviour of quantum-scale objects. As Albert
Einstein wrote:[1]
     It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes
     the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new
     kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality;
     separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but
     together they do.
Through the work of Max_Planck, Albert_Einstein, Louis_de_Broglie, Arthur
Compton, Niels_Bohr, and many others, current scientific theory holds that all
particles exhibit a wave nature and vice versa.[2] This phenomenon has been
verified not only for elementary particles, but also for compound particles
like atoms and even molecules. For macroscopic particles, because of their
extremely short wavelengths, wave properties usually cannot be detected.[3]
Although the use of the wave-particle duality has worked well in physics, the
meaning or interpretation has not been satisfactorily resolved; see
Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics.
Bohr regarded the "duality paradox" as a fundamental or metaphysical fact of
nature. A given kind of quantum object will exhibit sometimes wave, sometimes
particle, character, in respectively different physical settings. He saw such
duality as one aspect of the concept of complementarity.[4] Bohr regarded
renunciation of the cause-effect relation, or complementarity, of the space-
time picture, as essential to the quantum mechanical account.[5]
Werner_Heisenberg considered the question further. He saw the duality as
present for all quantic entities, but not quite in the usual quantum mechanical
account considered by Bohr. He saw it in what is called second_quantization,
which generates an entirely new concept of fields that exist in ordinary space-
time, causality still being visualizable. Classical field values (e.g. the
electric and magnetic field strengths of Maxwell) are replaced by an entirely
new kind of field value, as considered in quantum_field_theory. Turning the
reasoning around, ordinary quantum mechanics can be deduced as a specialized
consequence of quantum field theory.[6][7]

***** History[edit] *****
**** Classical particle and wave theories of light[edit] ****
Thomas Young's sketch of two-slit diffraction of waves, 1803
Democritus argued that all things in the universe, including light, are
composed of indivisible sub-components.[8] At the beginning of the 11th
century, the Arabic scientist Ibn_al-Haytham wrote the first comprehensive Book
of_optics describing reflection, refraction, and the operation of a pinhole
lens via rays of light traveling from the point of emission to the eye. He
asserted that these rays were composed of particles of light. In 1630, RenÃ©
Descartes popularized and accredited the opposing wave description in his
treatise on light, The_World_(Descartes), showing that the behavior of light
could be re-created by modeling wave-like disturbances in a universal medium
i.e. luminiferous_aether. Beginning in 1670 and progressing over three decades,
Isaac_Newton developed and championed his corpuscular_theory, arguing that the
perfectly straight lines of reflection demonstrated light's particle nature,
only particles could travel in such straight lines. He explained refraction by
positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon entering a denser
medium. Around the same time, Newton's contemporaries Robert_Hooke and
Christiaan_Huygens, and later Augustin-Jean_Fresnel, mathematically refined the
wave viewpoint, showing that if light traveled at different speeds in different
media, refraction could be easily explained as the medium-dependent propagation
of light waves. The resulting HuygensâFresnel_principle was extremely
successful at reproducing light's behavior and was subsequently supported by
Thomas_Young's discovery of wave_interference of light by his double-slit
experiment in 1801.[9][10] The wave view did not immediately displace the ray
and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the
mid 19th century, since it could explain polarization phenomena that the
alternatives could not.[11]
James_Clerk_Maxwell discovered that he could apply his previously discovered
Maxwell's_equations, along with a slight modification to describe self-
propagating waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. It quickly
became apparent that visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared light were
all electromagnetic waves of differing frequency.

**** Black-body radiation and Planck's law[edit] ****
Main article: Black-body_radiation
In 1901, Max_Planck published an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the
observed spectrum of light emitted by a glowing object. To accomplish this,
Planck had to make a mathematical assumption of quantized energy of the
oscillators i.e. atoms of the black_body that emit radiation. Einstein later
proposed that electromagnetic radiation itself is quantized, not the energy of
radiating atoms.
Black-body_radiation, the emission of electromagnetic energy due to an object's
heat, could not be explained from classical arguments alone. The equipartition
theorem of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic
theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the
object's vibrational modes. But applying the same reasoning to the
electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful. That
thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light was known to be
waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via
classical laws. This became known as the black_body problem. Since the
equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the
thermal object itself, it was natural to assume that it would perform equally
well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem
quickly arose if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short
wavelength modes would consume all the energy. This became clear when plotting
the RayleighâJeans_law, which, while correctly predicting the intensity of
long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity
diverges to infinity for short wavelengths. This became known as the
ultraviolet_catastrophe.
In 1900, Max_Planck hypothesized that the frequency of light emitted by the
black body depended on the frequency of the oscillator that emitted it, and the
energy of these oscillators increased linearly with frequency (according E = hf
where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency). This was not an unsound
proposal considering that macroscopic oscillators operate similarly when
studying five simple_harmonic_oscillators of equal amplitude but different
frequency, the oscillator with the highest frequency possesses the highest
energy (though this relationship is not linear like Planck's). By demanding
that high-frequency light must be emitted by an oscillator of equal frequency,
and further requiring that this oscillator occupy higher energy than one of a
lesser frequency, Planck avoided any catastrophe, giving an equal partition to
high-frequency oscillators produced successively fewer oscillators and less
emitted light. And as in the MaxwellâBoltzmann_distribution, the low-
frequency, low-energy oscillators were suppressed by the onslaught of thermal
jiggling from higher energy oscillators, which necessarily increased their
energy and frequency.
The most revolutionary aspect of Planck's treatment of the black body is that
it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in thermal_equilibrium
with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators give their entire energy to
the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, as often as they are
excited by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and
beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally
created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated
an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light
at a given frequency with an energy less than hÎ½. However, once realizing that
he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as
a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.
**** Photoelectric effect[edit] ****
Main article: Photoelectric_effect
The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate
(bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.
While Planck had solved the ultraviolet catastrophe by using atoms and a
quantized electromagnetic field, most contemporary physicists agreed that
Planck's "light quanta" represented only flaws in his model. A more-complete
derivation of black-body radiation would yield a fully continuous and "wave-
like" electromagnetic field with no quantization. However, in 1905 Albert
Einstein took Planck's black body model to produce his solution to another
outstanding problem of the day: the photoelectric_effect, wherein electrons are
emitted from atoms when they absorb energy from light. Since their existence
was theorized eight years previously, phenomena had been studied with the
electron model in mind in physics laboratories worldwide.
In 1902 Philipp_Lenard discovered that the energy of these ejected electrons
did not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but instead on its
frequency. So if one shines a little low-frequency light upon a metal, a few
low energy electrons are ejected. If one now shines a very intense beam of low-
frequency light upon the same metal, a whole slew of electrons are ejected;
however they possess the same low energy, there are merely more of them. The
more light there is, the more electrons are ejected. Whereas in order to get
high energy electrons, one must illuminate the metal with high-frequency light.
Like blackbody radiation, this was at odds with a theory invoking continuous
transfer of energy between radiation and matter. However, it can still be
explained using a fully classical description of light, as long as matter is
quantum mechanical in nature.[12]
If one used Planck's energy quanta, and demanded that electromagnetic radiation
at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples
of an energy quantum hÎ½, then the photoelectric effect could be explained very
simply. Low-frequency light only ejects low-energy electrons because each
electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon. Increasing the
intensity of the low-frequency light (increasing the number of photons) only
increases the number of excited electrons, not their energy, because the energy
of each photon remains low. Only by increasing the frequency of the light, and
thus increasing the energy of the photons, can one eject electrons with higher
energy. Thus, using Planck's constant h to determine the energy of the photons
based upon their frequency, the energy of ejected electrons should also
increase linearly with frequency, the gradient of the line being Planck's
constant. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when Robert_Andrews
Millikan produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's
predictions.
While energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck's constant, the existence of
photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the photon
antibunching effect, of which a modern experiment can be performed in
undergraduate-level labs.[13] This phenomenon could only be explained via
photons. Einstein's "light quanta" would not be called photons until 1925, but
even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave-particle
duality. Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations,
but can only be emitted or absorbed as discrete elements, thus acting as a wave
and a particle simultaneously.
*** Einstein's explanation of photoelectric effect[edit] ***
In 1905, Albert_Einstein provided an explanation of the photoelectric_effect,
an experiment that the wave theory of light failed to explain. He did so by
postulating the existence of photons, quanta of light energy with particulate
qualities.
In the photoelectric_effect, it was observed that shining a light on certain
metals would lead to an electric_current in a circuit. Presumably, the light
was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing current to flow. However,
using the case of potassium as an example, it was also observed that while a
dim blue light was enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red
light available with the technology of the time caused no current at all.
According to the classical theory of light and matter, the strength or
amplitude of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light
should have been easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly,
this was not so.
Einstein explained this enigma by postulating that the electrons can receive
energy from electromagnetic field only in discrete units (quanta or photons):
an amount of energy E that was related to the frequency f of the light by
         E = h f    {\displaystyle E=hf\,}  [E=hf\,]
where h is Planck's_constant (6.626 Ã 10â34 Js). Only photons of a high
enough frequency (above a certain threshold value) could knock an electron
free. For example, photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an
electron from the metal, but photons of red light did not. One photon of light
above the threshold frequency could release only one electron; the higher the
frequency of a photon, the higher the kinetic energy of the emitted electron,
but no amount of light below the threshold frequency could release an electron.
To violate this law would require extremely high-intensity lasers that had not
yet been invented. Intensity-dependent phenomena have now been studied in
detail with such lasers.[14]
Einstein was awarded the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics in 1921 for his discovery of
the law of the photoelectric effect.
**** de Broglie's hypothesis[edit] ****
Main article: Matter_wave
Propagation of de_Broglie_waves in 1dâreal part of the complex amplitude is
blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the colour opacity) of
finding the particle at a given point x is spread out like a waveform; there is
no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the
curvature decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versaâthe
result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: Plane_wave. Bottom: Wave
packet.
In 1924, Louis-Victor_de_Broglie formulated the de_Broglie_hypothesis, claiming
that all matter[15][16] has a wave-like nature, he related wavelength and
momentum:
         &#x03BB; =   h p     {\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {h}{p}}}  [\lambda
      ={\frac  {h}{p}}]
This is a generalization of Einstein's equation above, since the momentum of a
photon is given by p =        E c      {\displaystyle {\tfrac {E}{c}}}  [
{\tfrac  {E}{c}}] and the wavelength (in a vacuum) by Î» =        c f
{\displaystyle {\tfrac {c}{f}}}  [{\tfrac  {c}{f}}], where c is the speed_of
light in vacuum.
De Broglie's formula was confirmed three years later for electrons with the
observation of electron_diffraction in two independent experiments. At the
University_of_Aberdeen, George_Paget_Thomson passed a beam of electrons through
a thin metal film and observed the predicted interference patterns. At Bell
Labs, Clinton_Joseph_Davisson and Lester_Halbert_Germer guided the electron
beam through a crystalline grid in their experiment popularly known as
DavissonâGermer_experiment.
De Broglie was awarded the Nobel_Prize_for_Physics in 1929 for his hypothesis.
Thomson and Davisson shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for their
experimental work.
**** Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle[edit] ****
Main article: Uncertainty_principle
In his work on formulating quantum mechanics, Werner_Heisenberg postulated his
uncertainty_principle, which states:
         &#x0394; x  &#x0394; p &#x2265;    1 2    &#x210F;   {\displaystyle
      \Delta x\,\Delta p\geq {\tfrac {1}{2}}\hbar }  [{\displaystyle \Delta
      x\,\Delta p\geq {\tfrac {1}{2}}\hbar }]
where
         &#x0394;   {\displaystyle \Delta }  [\Delta ] here indicates standard
      deviation, a measure of spread or uncertainty;
      x and p are a particle's position and linear_momentum respectively.
         &#x210F;   {\displaystyle \hbar }  [\hbar ] is the reduced_Planck's
      constant (Planck's constant divided by 2    &#x03C0;   {\displaystyle \pi
      }  [\pi ]).
Heisenberg originally explained this as a consequence of the process of
measuring: Measuring position accurately would disturb momentum and vice versa,
offering an example (the "gamma-ray microscope") that depended crucially on the
de_Broglie_hypothesis. The thought is now, however, that this only partly
explains the phenomenon, but that the uncertainty also exists in the particle
itself, even before the measurement is made.
In fact, the modern explanation of the uncertainty principle, extending the
Copenhagen_interpretation first put forward by Bohr and Heisenberg, depends
even more centrally on the wave nature of a particle. Just as it is nonsensical
to discuss the precise location of a wave on a string, particles do not have
perfectly precise positions; likewise, just as it is nonsensical to discuss the
wavelength of a "pulse" wave traveling down a string, particles do not have
perfectly precise momenta that corresponds to the inverse of wavelength.
Moreover, when position is relatively well defined, the wave is pulse-like and
has a very ill-defined wavelength, and thus momentum. And conversely, when
momentum, and thus wavelength, is relatively well defined, the wave looks long
and sinusoidal, and therefore it has a very ill-defined position.
**** de BroglieâBohm theory[edit] ****
Main article: de_BroglieâBohm_theory
Couder experiments,[17] "materializing" the pilot wave model.
De Broglie himself had proposed a pilot_wave construct to explain the observed
wave-particle duality. In this view, each particle has a well-defined position
and momentum, but is guided by a wave function derived from SchrÃ¶dinger's
equation. The pilot wave theory was initially rejected because it generated
non-local effects when applied to systems involving more than one particle.
Non-locality, however, soon became established as an integral feature of
quantum_theory and David_Bohm extended de Broglie's model to explicitly include
it.
In the resulting representation, also called the de_BroglieâBohm_theory or
Bohmian mechanics,[18] the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the
wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's
motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum_potential.
     This idea seems to me so natural and simple, to resolve the
     waveâparticle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is
     a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored.[19] â
     J.S.Bell
The best illustration of the pilot-wave model was given by Couder's 2010
"walking droplets" experiments,[20] demonstrating the pilot-wave behaviour in a
macroscopic mechanical analog.[17]
***** Wave nature of large objects[edit] *****
Since the demonstrations of wave-like properties in photons and electrons,
similar experiments have been conducted with neutrons and protons. Among the
most famous experiments are those of Estermann and Otto_Stern in 1929.[21]
Authors of similar recent experiments with atoms and molecules, described
below, claim that these larger particles also act like waves.
A dramatic series of experiments emphasizing the action of gravity in relation
to waveâparticle duality was conducted in the 1970s using the neutron
interferometer.[22] Neutrons, one of the components of the atomic_nucleus,
provide much of the mass of a nucleus and thus of ordinary matter. In the
neutron interferometer, they act as quantum-mechanical waves directly subject
to the force of gravity. While the results were not surprising since gravity
was known to act on everything, including light (see tests_of_general
relativity and the PoundâRebka_falling_photon_experiment), the self-
interference of the quantum mechanical wave of a massive fermion in a
gravitational field had never been experimentally confirmed before.
In 1999, the diffraction of C60 fullerenes by researchers from the University
of_Vienna was reported.[23] Fullerenes are comparatively large and massive
objects, having an atomic mass of about 720 u. The de_Broglie_wavelength of the
incident beam was about 2.5 pm, whereas the diameter of the molecule is about
1 nm, about 400 times larger. In 2012, these far-field diffraction experiments
could be extended to phthalocyanine molecules and their heavier derivatives,
which are composed of 58 and 114 atoms respectively. In these experiments the
build-up of such interference patterns could be recorded in real time and with
single molecule sensitivity.[24][25]
In 2003, the Vienna group also demonstrated the wave nature of
tetraphenylporphyrin[26]âa flat biodye with an extension of about 2 nm and a
mass of 614 u. For this demonstration they employed a near-field Talbot_Lau
interferometer.[27][28] In the same interferometer they also found interference
fringes for C60F48., a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u,
composed of 108 atoms.[26] Large molecules are already so complex that they
give experimental access to some aspects of the quantum-classical interface,
i.e., to certain decoherence mechanisms.[29][30] In 2011, the interference of
molecules as heavy as 6910 u could be demonstrated in a
KapitzaâDiracâTalbotâLau interferometer.[31] In 2013, the interference of
molecules beyond 10,000 u has been demonstrated.[32]
Whether objects heavier than the Planck_mass (about the weight of a large
bacterium) have a de Broglie wavelength is theoretically unclear and
experimentally unreachable; above the Planck mass a particle's Compton
wavelength would be smaller than the Planck_length and its own Schwarzschild
radius, a scale at which current theories of physics may break down or need to
be replaced by more general ones.[33]
Recently Couder, Fort, et al. showed[34] that we can use macroscopic oil
droplets on a vibrating surface as a model of waveâparticle
dualityâlocalized droplet creates periodical waves around and interaction
with them leads to quantum-like phenomena: interference in double-slit
experiment,[35] unpredictable tunneling[36] (depending in complicated way on
practically hidden state of field), orbit quantization[37] (that particle has
to 'find a resonance' with field perturbations it createsâafter one orbit,
its internal phase has to return to the initial state) and Zeeman_effect.[38]
***** Importance[edit] *****
Waveâparticle duality is deeply embedded into the foundations of quantum
mechanics. In the formalism of the theory, all the information about a particle
is encoded in its wave_function, a complex-valued function roughly analogous to
the amplitude of a wave at each point in space. This function evolves according
to SchrÃ¶dinger_equation. For particles with mass this equation has solutions
that follow the form of the wave equation. Propagation of such waves leads to
wave-like phenomena such as interference and diffraction. Particles without
mass, like photons, have no solutions of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation so have
another wave.
The particle-like behaviour is most evident due to phenomena associated with
measurement_in_quantum_mechanics. Upon measuring the location of the particle,
the particle will be forced into a more localized state as given by the
uncertainty principle. When viewed through this formalism, the measurement of
the wave function will randomly lead to wave_function_collapse to a sharply
peaked function at some location. For particles with mass, the likelihood of
detecting the particle at any particular location is equal to the squared
amplitude of the wave function there. The measurement will return a well-
defined position, and is subject to Heisenberg's_uncertainty_principle.
Following the development of quantum_field_theory the ambiguity disappeared.
The field permits solutions that follow the wave equation, which are referred
to as the wave functions. The term particle is used to label the irreducible
representations of the Lorentz_group that are permitted by the field. An
interaction as in a Feynman_diagram is accepted as a calculationally convenient
approximation where the outgoing legs are known to be simplifications of the
propagation and the internal lines are for some order in an expansion of the
field interaction. Since the field is non-local and quantized, the phenomena
that previously were thought of as paradoxes are explained. Within the limits
of the wave-particle duality the quantum field theory gives the same results.
***** Visualization[edit] *****
There are two ways to visualize the wave-particle behaviour by the standard
model and by the de BroglieâBohr theory.
Below is an illustration of waveâparticle duality as it relates to de
Broglie's hypothesis and Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle, in terms of the
position and momentum space wavefunctions for one spinless particle with mass
in one dimension. These wavefunctions are Fourier_transforms of each other.
The more localized the position-space wavefunction, the more likely the
particle is to be found with the position coordinates in that region, and
correspondingly the momentum-space wavefunction is less localized so the
possible momentum components the particle could have are more widespread.
Conversely the more localized the momentum-space wavefunction, the more likely
the particle is to be found with those values of momentum components in that
region, and correspondingly the less localized the position-space wavefunction,
so the position coordinates the particle could occupy are more widespread.
Position x and momentum p wavefunctions corresponding to quantum particles. The
colour opacity of the particles corresponds to the probability density of
finding the particle with position x or momentum component p.
Top: If wavelength Î» is unknown, so are momentum p, wave-vector k and energy E
(de Broglie relations). As the particle is more localized in position space,
Îx is smaller than for Îpx.
Bottom: If Î» is known, so are p, k, and E. As the particle is more localized
in momentum space, Îp is smaller than for Îx.
***** Alternative views[edit] *****
Waveâparticle duality is an ongoing conundrum in modern physics. Most
physicists accept wave-particle duality as the best explanation for a broad
range of observed phenomena; however, it is not without controversy.
Alternative views are also presented here. These views are not generally
accepted by mainstream physics, but serve as a basis for valuable discussion
within the community.
**** 1. Both-particle-and-wave view[edit] ****
The pilot_wave model, originally developed by Louis_de_Broglie and further
developed by David_Bohm into the hidden_variable_theory proposes that there is
no duality, but rather a system exhibits both particle properties and wave
properties simultaneously, and particles are guided, in a deterministic
fashion, by the pilot wave (or its "quantum_potential"), which will direct them
to areas of constructive_interference in preference to areas of destructive
interference. This idea is held by a significant minority within the physics
community.[39]
At least one physicist considers the "wave-duality" as not being an
incomprehensible mystery. L.E. Ballentine, Quantum Mechanics, A Modern
Development, p. 4, explains:
     When first discovered, particle diffraction was a source of great
     puzzlement. Are "particles" really "waves?" In the early experiments,
     the diffraction patterns were detected holistically by means of a
     photographic plate, which could not detect individual particles. As a
     result, the notion grew that particle and wave properties were
     mutually incompatible, or complementary, in the sense that different
     measurement apparatuses would be required to observe them. That idea,
     however, was only an unfortunate generalization from a technological
     limitation. Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual
     electrons, and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical
     pattern made up of many small spots (Tonomura et al., 1989).
     Evidently, quantum particles are indeed particles, but whose
     behaviour is very different from classical physics would have us to
     expect.
The Afshar_experiment[40] (2007) may suggest that it is possible to
simultaneously observe both wave and particle properties of photons. This claim
is, however, disputed by other scientists.[41][42][43][44]
**** 2. Wave-only view[edit] ****
Carver_Mead, an American scientist and professor at Caltech, proposes that the
duality can be replaced by a "wave-only" view. In his book Collective
Electrodynamics: Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism (2000), Mead purports
to analyze the behavior of electrons and photons purely in terms of electron
wave functions, and attributes the apparent particle-like behavior to
quantization effects and eigenstates. According to reviewer David Haddon:[45]
     Mead has cut the Gordian_knot of quantum complementarity. He claims
     that atoms, with their neutrons, protons, and electrons, are not
     particles at all but pure waves of matter. Mead cites as the gross
     evidence of the exclusively wave nature of both light and matter the
     discovery between 1933 and 1996 of ten examples of pure wave
     phenomena, including the ubiquitous laser of CD_players, the self-
     propagating electrical currents of superconductors, and the
     BoseâEinstein_condensate of atoms.
Albert_Einstein, who, in his search for a Unified_Field_Theory, did not accept
wave-particle duality, wrote:[46]
     This double nature of radiation (and of material corpuscles) ... has
     been interpreted by quantum-mechanics in an ingenious and amazingly
     successful fashion. This interpretation ... appears to me as only a
     temporary way out...
The many-worlds_interpretation (MWI) is sometimes presented as a waves-only
theory, including by its originator, Hugh_Everett who referred to MWI as "the
wave interpretation".[47]
The three wave hypothesis of R. Horodecki relates the particle to wave.[48][49]
The hypothesis implies that a massive particle is an intrinsically spatially,
as well as temporally extended, wave phenomenon by a nonlinear law.
The deterministic collapse theory[50] considers collapse and measurement as two
independent physical processes. Collapse occurs when two wavepackets spatially
overlap and satisfy a mathemetical criterion, which depends on the parameters
of both wavepackets. It is a contraction to the overlap volume. In a
measurement apparatus one of the two wavepackets is one of the atomic clusters,
which constitute the apparatus, and the wavepackets collapse to at most the
volume of such a cluster. This mimics the action of a point particle.
**** 3. Particle-only view[edit] ****
Still in the days of the old_quantum_theory, a pre-quantum-mechanical version
of waveâparticle duality was pioneered by William_Duane,[51] and developed by
others including Alfred_LandÃ©.[52] Duane explained diffraction of x-rays by a
crystal in terms solely of their particle aspect. The deflection of the
trajectory of each diffracted photon was explained as due to quantized_momentum
transfer from the spatially regular structure of the diffracting crystal.[53]
**** 4. Neither-wave-nor-particle view[edit] ****
It has been argued that there are never exact particles or waves, but only some
compromise or intermediate between them. For this reason, in 1928 Arthur
Eddington[54] coined the name "wavicle" to describe the objects although it is
not regularly used today. One consideration is that zero-dimensional
mathematical_points cannot be observed. Another is that the formal
representation of such points, the Dirac_delta_function is unphysical, because
it cannot be normalized. Parallel arguments apply to pure wave states. Roger
Penrose states:[55]
     "Such 'position states' are idealized wavefunctions in the opposite
     sense from the momentum states. Whereas the momentum states are
     infinitely spread out, the position states are infinitely
     concentrated. Neither is normalizable [...]."
**** 5. Relational approach to waveâparticle duality[edit] ****
Relational_quantum_mechanics has been developed as a point of view that regards
the event of particle detection as having established a relationship between
the quantized field and the detector. The inherent ambiguity associated with
applying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is consequently avoided; hence
there is no wave-particle duality.[56]
***** Uses[edit] *****
Although it is difficult to draw a line separating waveâparticle duality from
the rest of quantum mechanics, it is nevertheless possible to list some
applications of this basic idea.
    * Waveâparticle duality is exploited in electron_microscopy, where the
      small wavelengths associated with the electron can be used to view
      objects much smaller than what is visible using visible light.
    * Similarly, neutron_diffraction uses neutrons with a wavelength of about
      0.1 nm, the typical spacing of atoms in a solid, to determine the
      structure of solids.
    * Photos are now able to show this dual nature, which may lead to new ways
      of examining and recording this behaviour.[57]
