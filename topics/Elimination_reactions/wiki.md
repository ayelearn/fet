Elimination reaction of cyclohexanol to cyclohexene with sulfuric_acid and heat
[1]
An elimination reaction is a type of organic_reaction in which two substituents
are removed from a molecule in either a one or two-step mechanism.[2] The one-
step mechanism is known as the E2 reaction, and the two-step mechanism is known
as the E1 reaction. The numbers do not have to do with the number of steps in
the mechanism, but rather the kinetics of the reaction, bimolecular and
unimolecular respectively. In cases where the molecule is able to stabilize an
anion but possesses a poor leaving group, a third type of reaction, E1CB,
exists. Finally, the pyrolysis of xanthate and acetate esters proceed through
an "internal" elimination mechanism, the Ei_mechanism.

***** Loss of hydron (H+)[edit] *****
See also: Deprotonation
In most organic elimination reactions, at least one hydron (H+) is lost to form
the double bond: the unsaturation of the molecule increases. It is also
possible that a molecule undergoes reductive_elimination, by which the valence
of an atom in the molecule decreases by two, though this is more common in
inorganic chemistry. An important class of elimination reactions is those
involving alkyl_halides, with good leaving_groups, reacting with a Lewis_base
to form an alkene. Elimination may be considered the reverse of an addition
reaction. When the substrate is asymmetric, regioselectivity is determined by
Zaitsev's_rule or through Hofmann_elimination if the carbon with the most
substituted hydrogen is inaccessible.
***** E2 mechanism[edit] *****
During the 1920s, Sir_Christopher_Ingold proposed a model to explain a peculiar
type of chemical reaction: the E2 mechanism. E2 stands for bimolecular
elimination. The reaction involves a one-step mechanism in which carbon-
hydrogen and carbon-halogen bonds break to form a double bond (C=C Pi_bond).
The specifics of the reaction are as follows:
    * E2 is a single step elimination, with a single transition_state.
    * It is typically undergone by primary substituted alkyl halides, but is
      possible with some secondary alkyl halides and other compounds.
    * The reaction_rate is second_order, because it's influenced by both the
      alkyl halide and the base (bimolecular).
    * Because the E2 mechanism results in the formation of a pi bond, the two
      leaving groups (often a hydrogen and a halogen) need to be
      antiperiplanar. An antiperiplanar transition_state has staggered
      conformation with lower energy than a synperiplanar transition state
      which is in eclipsed conformation with higher energy. The reaction
      mechanism involving staggered conformation is more favorable for E2
      reactions (unlike E1 reactions).
    * E2 typically uses a strong base. It must be strong enough to remove a
      weakly acidic hydrogen.
    * In order for the pi bond to be created, the hybridization of carbons
      needs to be lowered from sp3 to sp2.
    * The C-H bond is weakened in the rate_determining_step and therefore a
      primary deuterium_isotope_effect much larger than 1 (commonly 2-6) is
      observed.
    * E2 competes with the SN2_reaction mechanism if the base can also act as a
      nucleophile (true for many common bases).
[Scheme_1._E2_reaction_mechanism]
An example of this type of reaction in scheme 1 is the reaction of
isobutylbromide with potassium ethoxide in ethanol. The reaction products are
isobutylene, ethanol and potassium_bromide.
***** E1 mechanism[edit] *****
E1 is a model to explain a particular type of chemical elimination reaction. E1
stands for unimolecular elimination and has the following specifications
    * It is a two-step process of elimination: ionization and deprotonation.
          o Ionization: the carbon-halogen bond breaks to give a carbocation
            intermediate.
          o deprotonation of the carbocation.
    * E1 typically takes place with tertiary alkyl halides, but is possible
      with some secondary alkyl halides.
    * The reaction_rate is influenced only by the concentration of the alkyl
      halide because carbocation formation is the slowest step, as known as the
      rate-determining_step. Therefore, first-order_kinetics apply
      (unimolecular).
    * The reaction usually occurs in the complete absence of a base or the
      presence of only a weak base (acidic conditions and high temperature).
    * E1 reactions are in competition with SN1_reactions because they share a
      common carbocationic intermediate.
    * A secondary deuterium_isotope_effect of slightly larger than 1 (commonly
      1 - 1.5) is observed.
    * There is no antiperiplanar requirement. An example is the pyrolysis of a
      certain sulfonate_ester of menthol:
[E1_elimination_Nash_2008,_antiperiplanar_relationship_in_blue]
      Only reaction product A results from antiperiplanar elimination. The
      presence of product B is an indication that an E1 mechanism is occurring.
      [3]
    * It is accompanied by carbocationic rearrangement_reactions
[Scheme_2._E1_reaction_mechanism]
An example in scheme 2 is the reaction of tert-butylbromide with potassium
ethoxide in ethanol.
E1 eliminations happen with highly substituted alkyl halides for two main
reasons.
    * Highly substituted alkyl halides are bulky, limiting the room for the E2
      one-step mechanism; therefore, the two-step E1 mechanism is favored.
    * Highly substituted carbocations are more stable than methyl or primary
      substituted cations. Such stability gives time for the two-step E1
      mechanism to occur.
    * If SN1 and E1 pathways are competing, the E1 pathway can be favored by
      increasing the heat.
Specific features : 1 . Rearrangement possible 2 . Independent of concentration
and basicity of base
***** Competition among mechanisms[edit] *****
The reaction_rate is influenced by the reactivity of halogens, iodide and
bromide being favored. Fluoride is not a good leaving group, so eliminations
with fluoride as the leaving group have slower rates than other halogens. There
is a certain level of competition between the elimination reaction and
nucleophilic_substitution. More precisely, there are competitions between E2
and SN2 and also between E1 and SN1. Substitution generally predominates and
elimination occurs only during precise circumstances. Generally, elimination is
favored over substitution when
    * steric_hindrance around the Î±-carbon increases.
    * a stronger base is used.
    * temperature increases (increase entropy)
    * the base is a poor nucleophile. Bases with steric bulk, (such as in
      Potassium_tert-butoxide), are often poor nucleophiles.
In one study [4] the kinetic_isotope_effect (KIE) was determined for the gas
phase reaction of several alkyl halides with the chlorate ion. In accordance
with an E2 elimination the reaction with t-butyl_chloride results in a KIE of
2.3. The methyl_chloride reaction (only SN2 possible) on the other hand has a
KIE of 0.85 consistent with a SN2 reaction because in this reaction type the C-
H bonds tighten in the transition state. The KIE's for the ethyl (0.99) and
isopropyl (1.72) analogues suggest competition between the two reaction modes.
***** Elimination reactions other than Î²-elimination[edit] *****
Î²-Elimination, with loss of electrofuge and nucleofuge on vicinal carbons, is
by far the most common type of elimination. The ability to form a stable
product containing a C=C or C=X bond, as well as orbital alignment
considerations, strongly favors Î²-elimination over other elimination
processes.[5] However, other types are known, generally for systems where Î²-
elimination cannot occur.
[Eliminationrxns.png]
The next most common type of elimination reaction is Î±-elimination. For a
carbon center, the result of Î±-elimination is the formation of a carbene,
which includes "stable carbenes" such as carbon_monoxide or isocyanides. For
instance, Î±-elimination the elements of HCl from chloroform (CHCl3) in the
presence of strong base is a classic approach for the generation of
dichlorocarbene, :CCl2, as a reactive intermediate. On the other hand, formic
acid undergoes Î±-elimination to afford the stable products water and carbon
monoxide under acidic conditions. Î±-Elimination may also occur on a metal
center, one particularly common result of which is lowering of both the metal
oxidation state and coordination number by 2 units in a process known as
reductive_elimination. (Confusingly, in organometallic terminology, the terms
Î±-elimination and Î±-abstraction refer to processes that result in formation
of a metal-carbene complex.[6] In these reactions, it is the carbon adjacent to
the metal that undergoes Î±-elimination.)
In certain special cases, Î³- and higher eliminations to form three-membered or
larger rings is also possible in both organic and organometallic processes. For
instance, certain Pt(II) complexes undergo Î³- and Î´-elimination to give
metallocycles.[7] More recently, Î³-silyl elimination of a silylcyclobutyl
tosylate has been used to prepare strained bicyclic systems.[8]
