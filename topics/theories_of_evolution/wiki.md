Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations
over successive generations.[1][2] These characteristics are the expressions of
genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction.
Different characteristics tend to exist within any given population as a result
of mutation, genetic_recombination and other sources of genetic_variation.[3]
Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural_selection
(including sexual_selection) and genetic_drift act on this variation, resulting
in certain characteristics becoming more common or rare within a population.[4]
It is this process of evolution that has given rise to biodiversity at every
level of biological_organisation, including the levels of species, individual
organisms and molecules.[5][6]
The scientific_theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles
Darwin and Alfred_Russel_Wallace in the mid-19th century and was set out in
detail in Darwin's book On_the_Origin_of_Species (1859).[7] Evolution by
natural selection was first demonstrated by the observation that more offspring
are often produced than can possibly survive. This is followed by three
observable facts about living organisms: 1) traits vary among individuals with
respect to their morphology, physiology and behaviour (phenotypic_variation),
2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction
(differential fitness) and 3) traits can be passed from generation to
generation (heritability of fitness).[8] Thus, in successive generations
members of a population are more likely to be replaced by the progenies of
parents with favourable characteristics that have enabled them to survive and
reproduce in their respective environments. In the early 20th century, other
competing_ideas_of_evolution such as mutationism and orthogenesis were refuted
as the modern_synthesis reconciled Darwinian_evolution with classical_genetics,
which established adaptive_evolution as being caused by natural selection
acting on Mendelian genetic variation.[9]
All life on Earth shares a last_universal_common_ancestor (LUCA)[10][11][12]
that lived approximately 3.5â3.8 billion years ago.[13] The fossil_record
includes a progression from early biogenic graphite,[14] to microbial_mat
fossils,[15][16][17] to fossilised multicellular_organisms. Existing patterns
of biodiversity have been shaped by repeated formations of new species
(speciation), changes within species (anagenesis) and loss of species
(extinction) throughout the evolutionary_history_of_life on Earth.[18]
Morphological and biochemical traits are more similar among species that share
a more recent_common_ancestor, and can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic
trees.[19][20]
Evolutionary_biologists have continued to study various aspects of evolution by
forming and testing hypotheses as well as constructing theories based on
evidence from the field or laboratory and on data generated by the methods of
mathematical_and_theoretical_biology. Their discoveries have influenced not
just the development of biology but numerous other scientific and industrial
fields, including agriculture, medicine and computer_science.[21]

**** Classical times ****
The proposal that one type of organism could descend from another type goes
back to some of the first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, such as Anaximander
and Empedocles.[23] Such proposals survived into Roman times. The poet and
philosopher Lucretius followed Empedocles in his masterwork De_rerum_natura (On
the Nature of Things).[24][25]
**** Medieval ****
In contrast to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all
natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as
forms.[26][27] This was part of a medieval teleological understanding of nature
in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order.
Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle_Ages
and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that
real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical
forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could
come to be.[28]
**** Pre-Darwinian ****
In the 17th century, the new method of modern_science rejected the Aristotelian
approach. It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of physical_laws
that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the
existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order. However, this
new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, the last bastion
of the concept of fixed natural types. John_Ray applied one of the previously
more general terms for fixed natural types, "species," to plant and animal
types, but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and
proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated
themselves generation after generation.[29] The biological classification
introduced by Carl_Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognised the hierarchical
nature of species relationships, but still viewed species as fixed according to
a divine plan.[30]
Other naturalists of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species
over time according to natural laws. In 1751, Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis wrote of
natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many
generations to produce new species.[31] Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon
suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and Erasmus
Darwin proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a
single microorganism (or "filament").[32] The first full-fledged evolutionary
scheme was Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck's "transmutation" theory of 1809,[33] which
envisaged spontaneous_generation continually producing simple forms of life
that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent
progressive tendency, and postulated that on a local level, these lineages
adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse
in parents.[34][35] (The latter process was later called Lamarckism.)[34][36]
[37][38] These ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation
lacking empirical support. In particular, Georges_Cuvier insisted that species
were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for
functional needs. In the meantime, Ray's ideas of benevolent design had been
developed by William_Paley into the Natural_Theology_or_Evidences_of_the
Existence_and_Attributes_of_the_Deity (1802), which proposed complex
adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by Charles
Darwin.[39][40][41]
**** Darwinian revolution ****
The crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in
biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was
formulated by Charles_Darwin in terms of variable populations. Darwin used the
expression "descent with modification" rather than "evolution".[42] Partly
influenced by An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population (1798) by Thomas_Robert
Malthus, Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a "struggle for
existence" in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. In each
generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of
limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from
a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all
types of organism.[43][44][45][46] Darwin developed his theory of "natural
selection" from 1838 onwards and was writing up his "big book" on the subject
when Alfred_Russel_Wallace sent him a version of virtually the same theory in
1858. Their separate_papers were presented together at an 1858 meeting of the
Linnean_Society_of_London.[47] At the end of 1859, Darwin's publication of his
"abstract" as On the Origin of Species explained natural selection in detail
and in a way that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of Darwin's_concepts
of_evolution at the expense of alternative_theories. Thomas_Henry_Huxley
applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative_anatomy to
provide strong evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry. Some
were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special
place in the universe.[48]
**** Pangenesis and heredity ****
The mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits
remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory
of pangenesis.[49] In 1865, Gregor_Mendel reported that traits were inherited
in a predictable manner through the independent_assortment and segregation of
elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually
supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.[50] August_Weismann made the
important distinction between germ_cells that give rise to gametes (such as
sperm and egg_cells) and the somatic_cells of the body, demonstrating that
heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo_de_Vries connected Darwin's
pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that
Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell_nucleus and when expressed they
could move into the cytoplasm to change the cell's structure. De Vries was also
one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, believing that
Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the
germline.[51] To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a
mutation_theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted
Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries.[35][52][53] In
the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald_Fisher,
Sewall_Wright and J._B._S._Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a
robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory,
genetic mutations, and Mendelian_inheritance was thus reconciled.[54]
**** The 'modern synthesis' ****
Main article: Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)
In the 1920s and 1930s the so-called modern_synthesis connected natural
selection and population genetics, based on Mendelian inheritance, into a
unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern
synthesis explained patterns observed across species in populations, through
fossil_transitions in palaeontology, and complex cellular mechanisms in
developmental_biology.[35][55] The publication of the structure of DNA by James
Watson and Francis_Crick with contribution of Rosalind_Franklin in 1953
demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance.[56] Molecular_biology
improved understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype.
Advancements were also made in phylogenetic systematics, mapping the transition
of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and
use of evolutionary_trees.[57][58] In 1973, evolutionary biologist Theodosius
Dobzhansky penned that "nothing_in_biology_makes_sense_except_in_the_light_of
evolution," because it has brought to light the relations of what first seemed
disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent explanatory body of
knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this
planet.[59]
**** Further syntheses ****
Since then, the modern synthesis has been further extended to explain
biological phenomena across the full and integrative scale of the biological
hierarchy, from genes to species. One extension, known as evolutionary
developmental_biology and informally called "evo-devo," emphasises how changes
between generations (evolution) acts on patterns of change within individual
organisms (development).[60][61][62] Since the beginning of the 21st century
and in light of discoveries made in recent decades, some biologists have argued
for an extended_evolutionary_synthesis, which would account for the effects of
non-genetic inheritance modes, such as epigenetics, parental_effects,
ecological inheritance and cultural_inheritance, and evolvability.[63][64]
***** Heredity *****

in a double_helix.
Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traitsâthe
inherited characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, eye_colour is
an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the "brown-eye
trait" from one of their parents.[65] Inherited traits are controlled by genes
and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome (genetic material) is
called its genotype.[66]
The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour
of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction
of its genotype with the environment.[67] As a result, many aspects of an
organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from
the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not
passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than
others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are
people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very
sensitive to sunburn.[68]
Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a molecule
that encodes genetic information.[66] DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four
types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify
the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling
out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the
resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule
that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have
different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form
condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA
sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a
locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are
called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new
alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the
trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.[69]
However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works
in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative
trait_loci (multiple interacting genes).[70][71]
Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that
cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These
phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems.[72] DNA_methylation
marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA
interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as
prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at
the organismic level.[73][74] Developmental biologists suggest that complex
interactions in genetic_networks and communication among cells can lead to
heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental
plasticity and canalisation.[75] Heritability may also occur at even larger
scales. For example, ecological inheritance through the process of niche
construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in
their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back
into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes
plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of
ancestors.[76] Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under
the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural_traits and
symbiogenesis.[77][78]
***** Variation *****

Black morph in peppered_moth_evolution
Main article: Genetic_variation
Further information: Genetic_diversity and Population_genetics
An individual organism's phenotype results from both its genotype and the
influence from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the
phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation.[71] The
modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this
genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or
less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when
a new allele reaches the point of fixationâwhen it either disappears from the
population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.[79]
Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic
variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one
common hypothesis was blending_inheritance. But with blending inheritance,
genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection
implausible. The HardyâWeinberg_principle provides the solution to how
variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The
frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the
absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.[80]
Variation comes from mutations in the genome, reshuffling of genes through
sexual_reproduction and migration between populations (gene_flow). Despite the
constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of
the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.[81]
However, even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic
differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differ in only
about 5% of their genomes.[82]
**** Mutation ****
Main article: Mutation
Duplication of part of a chromosome
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome. When mutations
occur, they may alter the product_of_a_gene, or prevent the gene from
functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly Drosophila
melanogaster, it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein
produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these
mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or
weakly beneficial.[83]
Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated
(usually by genetic_recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene
into a genome.[84] Extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material
needed for new genes to evolve.[85] This is important because most new genes
evolve within gene_families from pre-existing genes that share common
ancestors.[86] For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures
that sense light: three for colour_vision and one for night_vision; all four
are descended from a single ancestral gene.[87]
New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates
and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been
duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the
pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its
original function.[88][89] Other types of mutations can even generate entirely
new genes from previously noncoding DNA.[90][91]
The generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being
duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with
new functions.[92][93] When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing
parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, which can be
mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions.[94]
For example, polyketide_synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they
contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in
the overall process, like a step in an assembly line.[95]
**** Sex and recombination ****
Further information: Sexual_reproduction, Genetic_recombination, and Evolution
of_sexual_reproduction
In asexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or linked, as they cannot
mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, the
offspring of sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents'
chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related
process called homologous_recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between
two matching chromosomes.[96] Recombination and reassortment do not alter
allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each
other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles.[97] Sex usually
increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.[98][99]
This diagram illustrates the twofold cost of sex. If each individual were to
contribute to the same number of offspring (two), (a) the sexual population
remains the same size each generation, where the (b) Asexual_reproduction
population doubles in size each generation.
The two-fold cost of sex was first described by John_Maynard_Smith.[100] The
first cost is that in sexually dimorphic species only one of the two sexes can
bear young. (This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most
plants and many invertebrates.) The second cost is that any individual who
reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual
offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes.[101] Yet
sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes
and multicellular organisms. The Red_Queen_hypothesis has been used to explain
the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual
evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an
ever-changing environment.[101][102][103][104]
**** Gene flow ****
Further information: Gene_flow
Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and between species.
[105] It can therefore be a source of variation that is new to a population or
to a species. Gene flow can be caused by the movement of individuals between
separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice
between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between
heavy-metal-tolerant and heavy-metal-sensitive populations of grasses.
Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and
horizontal_gene_transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic
material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this
is most common among bacteria.[106] In medicine, this contributes to the spread
of antibiotic_resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can
rapidly transfer them to other species.[107] Horizontal transfer of genes from
bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces_cerevisiae and the
adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus_chinensis has occurred.[108][109] An example
of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid_rotifers, which have
received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants.[110] Viruses can
also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across
biological_domains.[111]
Large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors of eukaryotic
cells and bacteria, during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria. It
is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene
transfers between bacteria and archaea.[112]
***** Mechanisms *****
Mutation followed by natural selection results in a population with darker
colouration.
From a neo-Darwinian perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in
the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms,[80]
for example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more
common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include
natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.
**** Natural selection ****
Main article: Natural_selection
Further information: Sexual_selection
Evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which traits that
enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations
of a population. It has often been called a "self-evident" mechanism because it
necessarily follows from three simple facts:[8]
    * Variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to
      morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation).
    * Different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction
      (differential fitness).
    * These traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of
      fitness).
More offspring are produced than can possibly survive, and these conditions
produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction.
Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their
competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than
those with traits that do not confer an advantage.[113] This teleonomy is the
quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits
that are seemingly_fitted for the functional roles they perform.[114]
Consequences of selection include nonrandom_mating[115] and genetic
hitchhiking.
The central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary_fitness of an
organism.[116] Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and
reproduce, which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next
generation.[116] However, fitness is not the same as the total number of
offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent
generations that carry an organism's genes.[117] For example, if an organism
could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small
and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to
future generations and would thus have low fitness.[116]
If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then
with each generation this allele will become more common within the population.
These traits are said to be "selected for." Examples of traits that can
increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fecundity. Conversely, the
lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results
in this allele becoming rarerâthey are "selected against."[118] Importantly,
the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment
changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and
previously beneficial traits become harmful.[69] However, even if the direction
of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may
not re-evolve in an identical form (see Dollo's_law).[119][120] However, a re-
activation of dormant genes, as long as they have not been eliminated from the
genome and were only suppressed perhaps for hundreds of generations, can lead
to the re-occurrence of traits thought to be lost like hindlegs in dolphins,
teeth in chickens, wings in wingless stick insects, tails and additional
nipples in humans etc.[121] "Throwbacks" such as these are known as atavisms.
These charts depict the different types of genetic selection. On each graph,
the x-axis variable is the type of phenotypic_trait and the y-axis variable is
the number of organisms. Group A is the original population and Group B is the
population after selection.
Â· Graph 1 shows directional_selection, in which a single extreme phenotype is
favoured.
Â· Graph 2 depicts stabilizing_selection, where the intermediate phenotype is
favoured over the extreme traits.
Â· Graph 3 shows disruptive_selection, in which the extreme phenotypes are
favoured over the intermediate.
Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range
of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The
first is directional_selection, which is a shift in the average value of a
trait over timeâfor example, organisms slowly getting taller.[122] Secondly,
disruptive_selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in
two_different_values becoming most common, with selection against the average
value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but
not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising_selection there is
selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in
variance around the average value and less diversity.[113][123] This would, for
example, cause organisms to eventually have a similar height.
A special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is selection for
any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an
organism to potential mates.[124] Traits that evolved through sexual selection
are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although
sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body
size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival
of individual males.[125][126] This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher
reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected
traits.[127]
Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which
individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. "Nature"
in this sense refers to an ecosystem, that is, a system in which organisms
interact with every other element, physical as well as biological, in their
local environment. Eugene_Odum, a founder of ecology, defined an ecosystem as:
"Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with
the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined
trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e., exchange of
materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system...."[128] Each
population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct niche, or position, with
distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships
involve the life history of the organism, its position in the food_chain and
its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to
delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.
Natural selection can act at different_levels_of_organisation, such as genes,
cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species.[129][130][131]
Selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously.[132] An example of
selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called
transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome.[133] Selection
at a level above the individual, such as group_selection, may allow the
evolution of cooperation, as discussed below.[134]
**** Biased mutation ****
In addition to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as
a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the
molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation
bias.[135] If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another
with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation
from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A
will tend to evolve.[136] Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in
different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes.[137][138]
Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological
evolution.[139][140] For example, according to the phenotype-first_theory_of
evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic_assimilation of traits
that were previously induced_by_the_environment.[141][142][143]
Mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes. If selection would
favour either one out of two mutations, but there is no extra advantage to
having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that
is most likely to become fixed in a population.[144][145] Mutations leading to
the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce
a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected
against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can
affect evolution.[146] For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals
live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost.[147] This kind of loss of
function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a
cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads
to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus_subtilis during laboratory
evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural
selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability.[148] When there
is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends
more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective_population_size,[149]
indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In
parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in
Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane
proteins.
**** Genetic drift ****
Further information: Genetic_drift and Effective_population_size
Simulation of genetic drift of 20 unlinked alleles in populations of 10 (top)
and 100 (bottom). Drift to fixation is more rapid in the smaller population.
Genetic drift is the random fluctuations of allele_frequencies within a
population from one generation to the next.[150] When selective forces are
absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies are equally likely to drift
upward or downward at each successive generation because the alleles are
subject to sampling_error.[151] This drift halts when an allele eventually
becomes fixed, either by disappearing from the population or replacing the
other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from
a population due to chance alone. Even in the absence of selective forces,
genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same
genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different
sets of alleles.[152]
The neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution proposed that most evolutionary
changes are the result of the fixation of neutral_mutations by genetic drift.
[153] Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population are the result
of constant mutation pressure and genetic drift.[154] This form of the neutral
theory is now largely abandoned, since it does not seem to fit the genetic
variation seen in nature.[155][156] However, a more recent and better-supported
version of this model is the nearly_neutral_theory, where a mutation that would
be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a
large population.[113] Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is
dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking,
also known as genetic draft.[151][157][158]
The time for a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on
population size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations.
[159] The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a
measure known as the effective population size.[160] The effective population
is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account
factors such as the level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which
the population is the smallest.[160] The effective population size may not be
the same for every gene in the same population.[161]
It is usually difficult to measure the relative importance of selection and
neutral processes, including drift.[162] The comparative importance of adaptive
and non-adaptive forces in driving evolutionary change is an area of current
research.[163]
**** Genetic hitchhiking ****
Further information: Genetic_hitchhiking, HillâRobertson_effect, and
Selective_sweep
Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated.
However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per
chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome
may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close
together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage.[164]
This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a
single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage
disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called
a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is
strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective_sweep that will
also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the
population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.[165]
Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked
to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate
effective population size.[157]
**** Gene flow ****
Further information: Gene_flow, Hybrid_(biology), and Horizontal_gene_transfer
Gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between
species.[105] The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the
course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely
isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through
neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller_model, even if both
populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the
environment.
If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between
populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the
local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations
evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations,
eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of
genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the
development of the Biological_Species_Concept (BSC).
During the development of the modern synthesis, Sewall Wright developed his
shifting_balance_theory, which regarded gene flow between partially isolated
populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution.[166] However,
recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting
balance theory.[167]

Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most
prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the
outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding
activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates.
Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually
by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the
longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral
populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.
These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as
macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that
occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and
extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes
within a species or population, in particular shifts in allele_frequency and
adaptation.[169] In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long
periods of microevolution.[170] Thus, the distinction between micro- and
macroevolution is not a fundamental oneâthe difference is simply the time
involved.[171] However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may
be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals
allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it
going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of
speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become
isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve
selection at different levelsâwith microevolution acting on genes and
organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species_selection acting
on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.[172]
[173][174]
A common misconception is that evolution has goals, long-term plans, or an
innate tendency for "progress", as expressed in beliefs such as orthogenesis
and evolutionism; realistically however, evolution has no long-term goal and
does not necessarily produce greater complexity.[175][176][177] Although
complex_species have evolved, they occur as a side effect of the overall number
of organisms increasing and simple forms of life still remain more common in
the biosphere.[178] For example, the overwhelming majority of species are
microscopic prokaryotes, which form about half the world's biomass despite
their small size,[179] and constitute the vast majority of Earth's
biodiversity.[180] Simple organisms have therefore been the dominant form of
life on Earth throughout its history and continue to be the main form of life
up to the present day, with complex life only appearing more diverse because it
is more_noticeable.[181] Indeed, the evolution of microorganisms is
particularly important to modern_evolutionary_research, since their rapid
reproduction allows the study of experimental_evolution and the observation of
evolution and adaptation in real time.[182][183]
**** Adaptation ****
Further information: Adaptation
Homologous bones in the limbs of tetrapods. The bones of these animals have the
same basic structure, but have been adapted for specific uses.
Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat.
[184][185] Also, the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for
an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of horses' teeth to the
grinding of grass. By using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process
and adaptive trait for the product (the bodily part or function), the two
senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by natural
selection.[186] The following definitions are due to Theodosius Dobzhansky:
   1. Adaptation is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better
      able to live in its habitat or habitats.[187]
   2. Adaptedness is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an
      organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.[188]
   3. An adaptive trait is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the
      organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism
      surviving and reproducing.[189]
Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an
ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial
adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic
resistance by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity
of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.[190] Other striking
examples are the bacteria Escherichia_coli evolving the ability to use citric
acid as a nutrient in a long-term_laboratory_experiment,[191] Flavobacterium
evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products
of nylon manufacturing,[192][193] and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving
an entirely new metabolic_pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide
pentachlorophenol.[194][195] An interesting but still controversial idea is
that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate
genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms'
evolvability).[196][197][198][199][200]
A baleen_whale skeleton, a and b label flipper bones, which were adapted from
front leg bones: while c indicates vestigial leg bones, suggesting an
adaptation from land to sea.[201]
Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures.
Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different
functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single ancestral
structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat
wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands,
due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor.
[202] However, since all living organisms are related to some extent,[203] even
organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as
arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and
vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their
assembly and function; this is called deep_homology.[204][205]
During evolution, some structures may lose their original function and become
vestigial_structures.[206] Such structures may have little or no function in a
current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other
closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes,[207] the non-functional
remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish,[208] wings in flightless birds,
[209] the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes,[201] and sexual traits in
organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction.[210] Examples of vestigial
structures_in_humans include wisdom_teeth,[211] the coccyx,[206] the vermiform
appendix,[206] and other behavioural vestiges such as goose_bumps[212][213] and
primitive_reflexes.[214][215][216]
However, many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact
exaptations: structures originally adapted for one function, but which
coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process.
[217] One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an
extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its
near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that
it assists in gliding from tree to treeâan exaptation.[217] Within cells,
molecular_machines such as the bacterial flagella[218] and protein_sorting
machinery[219] evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that
previously had different functions.[169] Another example is the recruitment of
enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic_metabolism to serve as structural
proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.[220][221]
An area of current investigation in evolutionary developmental biology is the
developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations.[222] This research
addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic_development and how
modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel
features.[223] These studies have shown that evolution can alter development to
produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the
jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle_ear_in_mammals.[224] It
is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear
due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing
embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles.[225] It is now becoming
clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a
small set of conserved genes.[226]
**** Coevolution ****
Common_garter_snake (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis) has evolved resistance to
the defensive_substance tetrodotoxin in its amphibian prey.
Further information: Coevolution
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation. When
the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a pathogen and a host, or
a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations.
Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species.
These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the
first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution.[227]
An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned_newt and the
evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common_garter_snake.
In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary_arms_race has produced high levels
of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the
snake.[228]
**** Cooperation ****
Further information: Co-operation_(evolution)
Not all co-evolved interactions between species involve conflict.[229] Many
cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an
extreme cooperation exists between plants and the mycorrhizal_fungi that grow
on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil.[230]
This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars
from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing
them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that
suppress the plant immune_system.[231]
Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme
case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, termites and
ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a
colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells
that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can
maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's
germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific
signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If
cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled
growth causes_cancer.[232]
Such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of kin
selection, which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's
offspring.[233] This activity is selected for because if the helping individual
contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin
will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on.[234]
Other processes that may promote cooperation include group_selection, where
cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.[235]
**** Speciation ****
Main article: Speciation
Further information: Assortative_mating and Panmixia
The four geographic modes of speciation
Speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant
species.[236]
There are multiple ways to define the concept of "species." The choice of
definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned.[237]
For example, some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually
reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual
organisms. Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various
concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches:
interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic.[238] The Biological Species Concept
(BSC) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach. Defined by
evolutionary biologist Ernst_Mayr in 1942, the BSC states that "species are
groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are
reproductively isolated from other such groups."[239] Despite its wide and
long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example
because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes,[240] and this is
called the species_problem.[237] Some researchers have attempted a unifying
monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and
suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition
of a species.[237][238]
Barriers_to_reproduction between two diverging sexual populations are required
for the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by
spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on
how far two species have diverged since their most_recent_common_ancestor, it
may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys
mating to produce mules.[241] Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this
case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be
selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids
are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties
intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype.
[242] The importance of hybridisation in producing new_species of animals is
unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals,[243] with the
gray_tree_frog being a particularly well-studied example.[244]
Speciation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory
conditions (see laboratory_experiments_of_speciation) and in nature.[245] In
sexually reproducing organisms, speciation results from reproductive isolation
followed by genealogical divergence. There are four primary geographic modes of
speciation. The most common in animals is allopatric_speciation, which occurs
in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat
fragmentation or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very
rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.[246][247] As
selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of
their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot
interbreed.[248]
The second mode of speciation is peripatric_speciation, which occurs when small
populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs
from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically
much smaller than the parental population. Here, the founder_effect causes
rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on
homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.[249]
The third mode is parapatric_speciation. This is similar to peripatric
speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that
there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead,
speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow
between the two populations.[236] Generally this occurs when there has been a
drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One
example is the grass Anthoxanthum_odoratum, which can undergo parapatric
speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines.[250] Here,
plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil.
Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population
produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants,
which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against
hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement, which is the
evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as character
displacement, which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.
[251]
Geographical_isolation of finches on the GalÃ¡pagos_Islands produced over a
dozen new species.
Finally, in sympatric_speciation species diverge without geographic isolation
or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even a small amount of gene flow
may remove genetic differences between parts of a population.[252] Generally,
sympatric speciation in animals requires the evolution of both genetic
differences and nonrandom_mating, to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.
[253]
One type of sympatric speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species
to produce a new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal
hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous
chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully
pair. However, it is more common in plants because plants often double their
number of chromosomes, to form polyploids.[254] This allows the chromosomes
from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each
parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already.[255] An example of such
a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis_thaliana and
Arabidopsis_arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica.[256]
This happened about 20,000 years ago,[257] and the speciation process has been
repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms
involved in this process.[258] Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may
be a common cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes
will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.[259]
Speciation events are important in the theory of punctuated_equilibrium, which
accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short "bursts" of evolution
interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain
relatively unchanged.[260] In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are
linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on
organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a
result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental
population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are
found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore
rarely being preserved as fossils.[173]
**** Extinction ****
Further information: Extinction
Tyrannosaurus_rex. Non-avian dinosaurs died out in the CretaceousâPaleogene
extinction_event at the end of the Cretaceous period.
Extinction is the disappearance of an entire species. Extinction is not an
unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear
through extinction.[261] Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on
Earth are now extinct,[262] and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of
all species.[263] These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the
history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass
extinction_events.[264] The CretaceousâPaleogene_extinction_event, during
which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the
earlier PermianâTriassic_extinction_event was even more severe, with
approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction.[264] The Holocene
extinction_event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's
expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day
extinction rates are 100â1000 times greater than the background rate and up
to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century.[265] Human
activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event;[266]
global_warming may further accelerate it in the future.[267] Despite the
estimated extinction of more than 99 percent of all species that ever lived on
Earth,[268][269] about 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth
currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.[270]
The role of extinction in evolution is not very well understood and may depend
on which type of extinction is considered.[264] The causes of the continuous
"low-level" extinction events, which form the majority of extinctions, may be
the result of competition between species for limited resources (the
competitive_exclusion_principle).[60] If one species can out-compete another,
this could produce species selection, with the fitter species surviving and the
other species being driven to extinction.[130] The intermittent mass
extinctions are also important, but instead of acting as a selective force,
they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of
rapid evolution and speciation in survivors.[271]

**** Origin of life ****
Further information: Abiogenesis, Earliest_known_life_forms, Panspermia, and
RNA_world_hypothesis
The Earth is about 4.54 billion years old.[272][273][274] The earliest
undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago,
[13][275] during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify
following the earlier molten Hadean Eon. Microbial mat fossils have been found
in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia.[15][16][17] Other
early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-
year-old metasedimentary_rocks discovered in Western Greenland[14] as well as
"remains of biotic_life" found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western
Australia.[276][277] Commenting on the Australian findings, Stephen_Blair
Hedges wrote, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth, then it could be
common in the universe."[276][278] In July 2016, scientists reported
identifying a set of 355 genes from the last_universal_common_ancestor (LUCA)
of all organisms living on Earth.[279]
More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,
[280] that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.[268][269] Estimates
on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million,
[281][282] of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named[283] and
1.6 million documented in a central database to date,[284] leaving at least 80
percent not yet described.
Highly energetic chemistry is thought to have produced a self-replicating
molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half a billion years later the last
common_ancestor_of_all_life existed.[11] The current scientific consensus is
that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical
reactions.[285] The beginning of life may have included self-replicating
molecules such as RNA[286] and the assembly of simple cells.[287]
**** Common descent ****
Further information: Common_descent and Evidence_of_common_descent
All organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene
pool.[203][288] Current species are a stage in the process of evolution, with
their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction
events.[289] The common descent of organisms was first deduced from four simple
facts about organisms: First, they have geographic distributions that cannot be
explained by local adaptation. Second, the diversity of life is not a set of
completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological
similarities. Third, vestigial_traits with no clear purpose resemble functional
ancestral traits. Fourth, organisms can be classified using these similarities
into a hierarchy of nested groups, similar to a family tree.[290]
The hominoids are descendants of a common_ancestor.
Modern research has suggested that, due to horizontal_gene_transfer, this "tree
of life" may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes
have spread independently between distantly related species.[291][292] To solve
this problem and others, some authors prefer to use the "Coral_of_life" as a
metaphor or a mathematical model to illustrate the evolution of life. This view
dates back to an idea briefly mentioned by Darwin but later abandoned.[293]
Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history. Fossils,
along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the
morphological, or anatomical, record.[294] By comparing the anatomies of both
modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those
species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard
body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as
bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils
do not provide information on their ancestry.
More recently, evidence for common descent has come from the study of
biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use
the same basic set of nucleotides and amino_acids.[295] The development of
molecular_genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms'
genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular_clock produced by
mutations.[296] For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that
humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas
where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species
existed.[297]
**** Evolution of life ****
Main articles: Evolutionary_history_of_life and Timeline_of_evolutionary
history_of_life
Evolutionary_tree showing the divergence of modern species from their common
ancestor in the centre.[298] The three domains are coloured, with bacteria
blue, archaea green and eukaryotes red.
Prokaryotes inhabited the Earth from approximately 3â4 billion years ago.
[299][300] No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred
in these organisms over the next few billion years.[301] The eukaryotic cells
emerged between 1.6â2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell
structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a
cooperative association called endosymbiosis.[302][303] The engulfed bacteria
and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into
either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes.[304] Another engulfment of
cyanobacterial-like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and
plants.[305]
The history of life was that of the unicellular eukaryotes, prokaryotes and
archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to
appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period.[299][306] The evolution_of
multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as
diverse as sponges, brown_algae, cyanobacteria, slime_moulds and myxobacteria.
[307] In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a
minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed
organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.[308]
Soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable
amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in
an event called the Cambrian_explosion. Here, the majority of types of modern
animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that
subsequently became extinct.[309] Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion
have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from
photosynthesis.[310]
About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonised the land and were soon
followed by arthropods and other animals.[311] Insects were particularly
successful and even today make up the majority of animal species.[312]
Amphibians first appeared around 364 million years ago, followed by early
amniotes and birds around 155 million years ago (both from "reptile"-like
lineages), mammals around 129 million years ago, homininae around 10 million
years ago and modern_humans around 250,000 years ago.[313][314][315] However,
despite the evolution of these large animals, smaller organisms similar to the
types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and
dominate the Earth, with the majority of both biomass and species being
prokaryotes.[180]
***** Applications *****
Main articles: Applications_of_evolution, Selective_breeding, and Evolutionary
computation
Concepts and models used in evolutionary biology, such as natural selection,
have many applications.[316]
Artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of
organisms. This has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of
plants and animals.[317] More recently, such selection has become a vital part
of genetic_engineering, with selectable_markers such as antibiotic resistance
genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have
evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified
enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed_evolution.[318]
Understanding the changes that have occurred during an organism's evolution can
reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be
involved in human genetic_disorders.[319] For example, the Mexican_tetra is an
albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together
different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with
functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated
populations that had evolved in different caves.[320] This helped identify
genes required for vision and pigmentation.[321]
Evolutionary theory has many applications in medicine. Many human diseases are
not static phenomena, but capable of evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and
cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune_defences, as well as
pharmaceutical_drugs.[322][323][324] These same problems occur in agriculture
with pesticide[325] and herbicide[326] resistance. It is possible that we are
facing the end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics[327] and
predicting the evolution and evolvability[328] of our pathogens and devising
strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the
complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.[329]
In computer_science, simulations of evolution using evolutionary_algorithms and
artificial_life started in the 1960s and were extended with simulation of
artificial selection.[330] Artificial evolution became a widely recognised
optimisation method as a result of the work of Ingo_Rechenberg in the 1960s. He
used evolution_strategies to solve complex engineering problems.[331] Genetic
algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John_Henry
Holland.[332] Practical applications also include automatic_evolution_of
computer_programmes.[333] Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-
dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers
and also to optimise the design of systems.[334]
***** Social and cultural responses *****

evolution_debate, Creationâevolution_controversy, Objections_to_evolution,
and Evolution_in_fiction
As evolution became widely accepted in the 1870s, caricatures of Charles Darwin
with an ape or monkey body symbolised evolution.[335]
In the 19th century, particularly after the publication of On the Origin of
Species in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of
academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications
of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast
majority of scientists.[60] However, evolution remains a contentious concept
for some theists.[336]
While various_religions_and_denominations have reconciled their beliefs with
evolution through concepts such as theistic_evolution, there are creationists
who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation_myths found in their
religions and who raise various objections_to_evolution.[169][337][338] As had
been demonstrated by responses to the publication of Vestiges_of_the_Natural
History_of_Creation in 1844, the most controversial aspect of evolutionary
biology is the implication of human_evolution that humans share common ancestry
with apes and that the mental and moral_faculties of humanity have the same
types of natural causes as other inherited traits in animals.[339] In some
countries, notably the United States, these tensions between science and
religion have fuelled the current creationâevolution controversy, a religious
conflict focusing on politics and public_education.[340] While other scientific
fields such as cosmology[341] and Earth_science[342] also conflict with literal
interpretations of many religious_texts, evolutionary biology experiences
significantly more opposition from religious literalists.
The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was
uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century. The Scopes_Trial
decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary
biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later
and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson_v._Arkansas decision. Since
then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in
secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it
returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent_design (ID), to be excluded
once again in the 2005 Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District case.[343] The
debate over Darwin's ideas did not generate significant controversy in China.

      Evolutionary processes are generally thought of as processes by which
      these changes occur. Four such processes are widely recognized: natural
      selection (in the broad sense, to include sexual selection), genetic
      drift, mutation, and migration (Fisher 1930; Haldane 1932). The latter
      two generate variation; the first two sort it.
