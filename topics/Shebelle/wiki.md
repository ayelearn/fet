The Shebelle River (Somali: Webi Shabeelle, Arabic: ÙÙØ± Ø§ÙØ´Ø¨ÙÙ‎,
Amharic: á¥á°á, Italian: Uebi Scebeli) begins in the highlands of Ethiopia,
and then flows southeast into Somalia towards Mogadishu. Near Mogadishu, it
turns sharply southwest, where it follows the coast. Below Mogadishu, the river
becomes seasonal. During most years, the river dries up near the mouth of the
Jubba_River, while in seasons of heavy rainfall, the river actually reaches the
Jubba and thus the Somali_Sea.
The Shebelle river's name is derived from the Somali term Wabi Shabeelle,
meaning "Leopard/Tiger River". The Somali administrative regions consisting of
Shabeellaha_Dhexe and Shabeellaha_Hoose are also named after the river.

***** Tributaries[edit] *****
The Shebelle has a number of tributaries, both seasonal and permanent rivers.
They include:
    * Erer_River
    * Galetti_River
    * Wabe_River
The Fafen only reaches the Shebelle in times of heavy rainfall; its stream
usually ends before reaching the main river.
***** History[edit] *****
**** Ajuran Empire[edit] ****
The Shebelle River has a rich history of a once-booming sophisticated
civilization and trade network conducted by the powerful Somalis that held sway
over the Shebelle river.
During the middle ages Shebelle river was under the Ajuran_Empire of the Horn
of_Africa which utilized the Shebelle River for its plantations and was the
only hydraulic_empire in Africa. A hydraulic empire that rose in the 13th
century AD, Ajuran monopolized the water resources of the Jubba and Shebelle
Rivers. Through hydraulic_engineering, it also constructed many of the
limestone wells and cisterns of the state that are still operative and in use
today. Its rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which
continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th
century.[1]
Through their control of the region's wells, the Garen rulers effectively held
a monopoly over their nomadic subjects as they were the only hydraulic_empire
in Africa during their reign. Large wells made out of limestone were
constructed throughout the state, which attracted Somali and Oromo nomads with
their livestock. The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for
the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials
who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice
in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous
ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of
Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the
medieval period.[2]
With the centralized supervision of the Ajuran, farms in Afgooye, Bardhere and
other areas in the Jubba and Shabelle valleys increased their productivity. A
system of irrigation ditches known locally as Kelliyo fed directly from the
Shebelle River and Jubba_rivers into the plantations where sorghum, maize,
beans, grain and cotton were grown during the gu (Spring in Somali) and xagaa
(Summer in Somali) seasons of the Somali_calendar. This irrigation system was
supported by numerous dikes and dams. To determine the average size of a farm,
a land measurement system was also invented with moos, taraab and guldeed being
the terms used.
The urban centers of Mogadishu, Merca, Barawa, Kismayo and Hobyo and other
respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating
from the interior of the State. The Somali farming communities of the
hinterland from Jubba and Shebella valleys brought their crops to the Somali
coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained a
lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from Arabia,
Persia, India, Venice, Egypt, Portugal, and as far away as Java and China.[3]
**** Modern Period[edit] ****
The source of the Shebelle River is cultivated by the Arsi_Oromo, Sidamo and
mostly Somalis, respectively. It is surrounded by a sacred enclosure wooded
with juniper trees, which as of 1951 was under the protection of a Muslim
member of the Arsi.[4]
In 1989, with the help of Soviet engineers, the Melka_Wakena_dam was built on
the upper reaches of the Shebelle River in the Bale_Mountains. Producing 153
megawatts, this dam is Ethiopiaâs largest hydroelectric generator.[5]
The recent history of the Shabelle is marked by frequent destructive flash
floods. The Shabelle is said to have flooded every other year prior to the
1960s; that decade had only two devastating floods, the hidigsayley in 1965,
and the soogudud in 1966. In the 1970s, the most devastating flood was the
kabahay of 1978.[6] In 1996, floods devastated three woredas in Ethiopia. On 23
October 1999, the river unexpectedly flooded in the middle of the night,
destroying homes and crops in 14 out of the 117 kebeles in Kelafo woreda, as
well as 29 of the 46 kebeles in neighboring Mustahil woreda. According to the
local authorities, 34 people and an estimated 750 livestock died, with 70,000
affected by the floods and in need of assistance.[7] Two more recent floods
were the dawdle in 2003, when about 100 livestock and 119 people were washed
away, and the flood of April 2005, when about 30,000 persons were surrounded by
floodwaters and 2000 camels and 4000 shoats were washed away by the floods;
some locals consider this the worst flood in 40 years.[6]
