Jet_streams (shown in pink) are well-known examples of thermal wind. They arise
from the horizontal temperature gradients between the warm tropics and the
colder polar_regions.
The thermal wind is the variation in strength of wind with height due to, on
one hand, a balance between the Coriolis and pressure-gradient forces in the
atmosphere and, on the other hand, horizontal temperature gradients. It is the
primary physical mechanism for the jet_stream and plays an important role in
other large-scale atmospheric phenomena. The thermal wind ensures the jet
stream is typically strongest in the upper half of the troposphere, which is
the atmospheric layer extending from the surface of the planet up to a height
of 12 km to 15 km.
Mathematically, the thermal wind relation defines a vertical wind_shear â a
variation in wind speed or direction with height. The wind shear in this case
is a function of a horizontal temperature gradient, which is a variation in
temperature over some horizontal distance. Also called baroclinic flow, the
thermal wind varies with height in proportion to the horizontal temperature
gradient. The thermal wind relation results from hydrostatic_balance and
geostrophic_balance in the presence of a temperature_gradient along constant
pressure surfaces, or isobars.
The term thermal wind is often considered a misnomer, since it really describes
the change in wind with height, rather than the wind itself. However, one can
view the thermal wind as a geostrophic_wind that varies with height, so that
the term wind seems appropriate. In the early years of meteorology, when data
was scarce, the wind field could be estimated using the thermal wind relation
and knowledge of a surface wind speed and direction as well as thermodynamic
soundings aloft.[1] In this way, the thermal wind relation acts to define the
wind itself, rather than just its shear. Many authors retain the thermal wind
moniker, even though it describes a wind gradient, sometimes offering a
clarification to that effect.

***** Description[edit] *****
**** Physical explanation[edit] ****
The thermal wind is the change in the amplitude or sign of the geostrophic_wind
due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic_wind is an idealized
wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension.
Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in
the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis_force and the pressure-
gradient_force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure
pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal
difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However,
the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the
northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The
balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels
the horizontal pressure difference, or pressure gradient.[1] In addition, when
forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-
gradient_force and the gravitational_force, hydrostatic_balance occurs.
The geostrophic wind on different isobaric levels in a barotropic atmosphere
(a) and in a baroclinic atmosphere (b). The blue portion of the surface denotes
a cold region while the orange portion denotes a warm region. This temperature
structure is restricted to the surface in (a) but extends through the depth of
the fluid in (b). The dotted lines enclose isobaric surfaces which remain at
constant slope with increasing height in (a) and increase in slope with height
in (b). Pink arrows illustrate the direction and amplitude of the horizontal
wind. Only in the baroclinic atmosphere (b) do these vary with height. Such
variation illustrates the thermal wind.
In a barotropic atmosphere, where density is a function only of pressure, a
horizontal pressure gradient will drive a geostrophic wind that is constant
with height. However, if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along
isobars, the isobars will also vary with the temperature. In the mid-latitudes
there often is a positive coupling between pressure and temperature. Such a
coupling causes the slope of the isobars to increase with height, as
illustrated in panel (b) of the figure to the left. Because isobars are steeper
at higher elevations, the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there.
However, the Coriolis force is the same, so the resulting geostrophic wind at
higher elevations must be greater in the direction of the pressure force.[2]
In a baroclinic atmosphere, where density is a function of both pressure and
temperature, such horizontal temperature gradients can exist. The difference in
horizontal wind speed with height that results is a vertical wind shear,
traditionally called the thermal wind.[2]
**** Mathematical formalism[edit] ****
The geopotential thickness of an atmospheric layer defined by two different
pressures is described by the hypsometric_equation:
    &#x03A6;  1   &#x2212;  &#x03A6;  0   = &#xA0; R   T &#x00AF;   ln &#x2061;
[    p  0    p  1     ]    {\displaystyle \Phi _{1}-\Phi _{0}=\ R{\overline
{T}}\ln \left[{\frac {p_{0}}{p_{1}}}\right]}  [{\displaystyle \Phi _{1}-\Phi _
{0}=\ R{\overline {T}}\ln \left[{\frac {p_{0}}{p_{1}}}\right]}],
where      R    {\displaystyle \,R\,}  [\,R\,] is the specific gas_constant for
air,       &#x03A6;  n      {\displaystyle \,\Phi _{n}\,}  [\,\Phi _{n}\,] is
the geopotential at pressure level       p  n      {\displaystyle \,p_{n}\,}
[\,p_{n}\,], and       T &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle {\overline {T}}}
[\overline {T}] is the vertically-averaged temperature of the layer. This
formula shows that the layer thickness is proportional to the temperature. When
there is a horizontal temperature gradient, the thickness of the layer would be
greatest where the temperature is greatest.
Differentiating the geostrophic wind,       v   g   =   1 f    k  &#x00D7;
&#x2207;  p   &#x03A6;   {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{g}={\frac {1}{f}}\mathbf
{k} \times \nabla _{p}\Phi }  [{\mathbf  {v}}_{g}={\frac  {1}{f}}{\mathbf
{k}}\times \nabla _{p}\Phi ] (where      f    {\displaystyle \;f\;}  [\;f\;] is
the Coriolis_parameter,      k    {\displaystyle \mathbf {k} }  [\mathbf {k} ]
is the vertical unit vector, and the subscript "p" on the gradient operator
denotes gradient on a constant pressure surface) with respect to pressure, and
integrate from pressure level       p  0      {\displaystyle \,p_{0}\,}  [\,p_
{0}\,] to       p  1      {\displaystyle \,p_{1}\,}  [\,p_{1}\,], we obtain the
thermal wind equation:
     v   T   =   1 f    k  &#x00D7;  &#x2207;  p   (  &#x03A6;  1   &#x2212;
&#x03A6;  0   )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{T}={\frac {1}{f}}\mathbf {k}
\times \nabla _{p}(\Phi _{1}-\Phi _{0})}  [{\mathbf  {v}}_{T}={\frac  {1}{f}}
{\mathbf  {k}}\times \nabla _{p}(\Phi _{1}-\Phi _{0})].
Substituting the hypsometric equation, one gets a form based on temperature,
     v   T   =   R f   ln &#x2061;  [    p  0    p  1     ]   k  &#x00D7;
&#x2207;  p     T &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{T}={\frac {R}
{f}}\ln \left[{\frac {p_{0}}{p_{1}}}\right]\mathbf {k} \times \nabla _{p}
{\overline {T}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{T}={\frac {R}{f}}\ln \left[
{\frac {p_{0}}{p_{1}}}\right]\mathbf {k} \times \nabla _{p}{\overline {T}}}].
Note that thermal wind is at right angles to the horizontal temperature
gradient, counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere. In the southern
hemisphere, the change in sign of      f    {\displaystyle \;f\;}  [\;f\;]
flips the direction.
***** Examples[edit] *****
**** Advection turning[edit] ****
In (a), cold advection is occurring, so the thermal wind causes the geostrophic
wind to rotate counterclockwise (for the northern hemisphere) with height. In
(b), warm advection is occurring, so the geostrophic wind rotates clockwise
with height.
If a component of the geostrophic wind is parallel to the temperature gradient,
the thermal wind will cause the geostrophic wind to rotate with height. If
geostrophic wind blows from cold air to warm air (cold advection) the
geostrophic wind will turn counterclockwise with height (for the northern
hemisphere), a phenomenon known as wind backing. Otherwise, if geostrophic wind
blows from warm air to cold air (warm advection) the wind will turn clockwise
with height, also known as wind veering.
Wind backing and veering allow an estimation of the horizontal temperature
gradient with data from an atmospheric_sounding.
**** Frontogenesis[edit] ****
As in the case of advection turning, when there is a cross-isothermal component
of the geostrophic wind, a sharpening of the temperature gradient results.
Thermal wind causes a deformation field and frontogenesis may occur.
**** Jet stream[edit] ****
A horizontal temperature gradient exists while moving North-South along a
meridian because curvature of the Earth allows for more solar_heating at the
equator than at the poles. This creates a westerly geostrophic wind pattern to
form in the mid-latitudes. Because thermal wind causes an increase in wind
velocity with height, the westerly pattern increases in intensity up until the
tropopause, creating a strong wind current known as the jet_stream. The
Northern and Southern_Hemispheres exhibit similar jet stream patterns in the
mid-latitudes.
The strongest part of jet streams should be in proximity where temperature
gradients are the largest. Due to land masses in the northern hemisphere,
largest temperature contrasts are observed on the east coast of North America
(boundary between Canadian cold air mass and the Gulf Stream/warmer Atlantic)
and Eurasia (boundary between the boreal winter monsoon/Siberian cold air mass
and the warm Pacific). Therefore, the strongest boreal winter jet streams are
observed over east coast of North America and Eurasia. Since stronger vertical
shear promotes baroclinic_instability, the most rapid development of
extratropical_cyclones (so called bombs) is also observed along the east coast
of North America and Eurasia.
The lack of land masses in the Southern Hemisphere leads to a more constant jet
with longitude (i.e. a more zonally symmetric jet).
