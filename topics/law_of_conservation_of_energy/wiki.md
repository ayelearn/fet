In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of energy states that the
total energy of an isolated_system remains constant; it is said to be conserved
over time.[1] This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed;
rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For
instance, chemical_energy is converted to kinetic_energy when a stick of
dynamite explodes. If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in
the explosion, such as the kinetic_energy and potential_energy of the pieces,
as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy
in the combustion of the dynamite. Classically, conservation of energy was
distinct from conservation of mass; however, special_relativity showed that
mass is related to energy and vice versa by E = mc2, and science now takes the
view that massâenergy is conserved.
Conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by Noether's_theorem as a
consequence of continuous time_translation_symmetry; that is, from the fact
that the laws of physics do not change over time.
A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a perpetual_motion
machine_of_the_first_kind cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an
external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its
surroundings.[2] For systems which do not have time_translation_symmetry, it
may not be possible to define conservation of energy. Examples include curved
spacetimes in general_relativity[3] or time_crystals in condensed_matter
physics.[4][5][6][7]

Gottfried_Leibniz
Ancient philosophers as far back as Thales_of_Miletus c. 550 BCE had inklings
of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made.
However, there is no particular reason to identify this with what we know today
as "mass-energy" (for example, Thales thought it was water). Empedocles
(490â430 BCE) wrote that in this universal system, composed of four_roots
(earth, air, water, fire), "nothing comes to be or perishes";[8] instead, these
elements suffer continual rearrangement.
In 1605, Simon_Stevinus was able to solve a number of problems in statics based
on the principle that perpetual_motion was impossible.
In 1639, Galileo published his analysis of several situationsâincluding the
celebrated "interrupted pendulum"âwhich can be described (in modern language)
as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again.
Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the
height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of
inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which
a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of
the surface.
In 1669, Christiaan_Huygens published his laws of collision. Among the
quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of
bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their
kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic
collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later
researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental.
In his Horologium_Oscillatorium, he gave a much clearer statement regarding the
height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the
impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum
motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy
object cannot lift itself.
The fact that kinetic energy is scalar, unlike linear momentum which is a
vector, and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of Gottfried
Wilhelm_Leibniz. It was Leibniz during 1676â1689 who first attempted a
mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with motion
(kinetic energy). Using Huygens' work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in
many mechanical systems (of several masses, mi each with velocity vi),
          &#x2211;  i    m  i    v  i   2     {\displaystyle \sum _{i}m_{i}v_
      {i}^{2}}  [\sum _{i}m_{i}v_{i}^{2}]
was conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity
the vis_viva or living force of the system. The principle represents an
accurate statement of the approximate conservation of kinetic_energy in
situations where there is no friction. Many physicists at that time, such as
Newton, held that the conservation_of_momentum, which holds even in systems
with friction, as defined by the momentum:
            &#x2211;  i    m  i    v  i     {\displaystyle \,\!\sum _{i}m_{i}v_
      {i}}  [\,\!\sum _{i}m_{i}v_{i}]
was the conserved vis viva. It was later shown that both quantities are
conserved simultaneously, given the proper conditions such as an elastic
collision.
In 1687, Isaac_Newton published his Principia, which was organized around the
concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize
that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not
sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other
principles were also required.
Daniel_Bernoulli
The law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo,
Johann and Daniel_Bernoulli. The former enunciated the principle of virtual
work as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based
his Hydrodynamica, published in 1738, on this single conservation principle.
Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the
Bernoulli's_principle, which relates the loss to be proportional to the change
in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and
efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and
linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.
This focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the
discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the
D'Alembert's_principle, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian formulations of mechanics.
Ãmilie_du_ChÃ¢telet (1706 â 1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the
conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the
theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment
originally devised by Willem_'s_Gravesande in 1722 in which balls were dropped
from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy -
as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be
proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was
found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from,
equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, including Newton and
Voltaire, had all believed that "energy" (so far as they understood the concept
at all) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity.
According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been
proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped
from. In classical physics the correct formula is      E  k   =   1 2   m  v  2
{\displaystyle E_{k}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}  [E_{k}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}], where
E  k     {\displaystyle E_{k}}  [E_{k}] is the kinetic energy of an object,
m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] its mass and     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] its
speed. On this basis, ChÃ¢telet proposed that energy must always have the same
dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different
forms (kinetic, potential, heatâ¦).[9][10]
Engineers such as John_Smeaton, Peter_Ewart, Carl_Holtzmann, Gustave-Adolphe
Hirn and Marc_Seguin recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not
adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz's principle. The
principle was also championed by some chemists such as William_Hyde_Wollaston.
Academics such as John_Playfair were quick to point out that kinetic energy is
clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the second
law_of_thermodynamics, but in the 18th and 19th centuries the fate of the lost
energy was still unknown.
Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion
under friction was another form of vis viva. In 1783, Antoine_Lavoisier and
Pierre-Simon_Laplace reviewed the two competing theories of vis viva and
caloric_theory.[11] Count_Rumford's 1798 observations of heat generation during
the boring of cannons added more weight to the view that mechanical motion
could be converted into heat, and (as importantly) that the conversion was
quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion
constant between kinetic energy and heat). Vis viva then started to be known as
energy, after the term was first used in that sense by Thomas_Young in 1807.
Gaspard-Gustave_Coriolis
The recalibration of vis viva to
           1 2    &#x2211;  i    m  i    v  i   2     {\displaystyle {\frac {1}
      {2}}\sum _{i}m_{i}v_{i}^{2}}  [{\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{i}m_{i}v_{i}^{2}]
which can be understood as converting kinetic energy to work, was largely the
result of Gaspard-Gustave_Coriolis and Jean-Victor_Poncelet over the period
1819â1839. The former called the quantity quantitÃ© de travail (quantity of
work) and the latter, travail mÃ©canique (mechanical work), and both championed
its use in engineering calculation.
In a paper Ãber die Natur der WÃ¤rme(German "On the Nature of Heat/Warmth"),
published in the Zeitschrift_fÃ¼r_Physik in 1837, Karl_Friedrich_Mohr gave one
of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of
energy in the words: "besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the
physical world one agent only, and this is called Kraft [energy or work]. It
may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion,
electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be
transformed into any of the others."
**** Mechanical equivalent of heat[edit] ****
A key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the
demonstration of the mechanical_equivalent_of_heat. The caloric_theory
maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas
conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical
work are interchangeable.
In the middle of the eighteenth century, Mikhail_Lomonosov, a Russian
scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the
idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to
the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the
caloric fluid.
In 1798, Count Rumford (Benjamin_Thompson) performed measurements of the
frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat
is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were
imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.
James_Prescott_Joule
The mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the
German surgeon Julius_Robert_von_Mayer in 1842.[12] Mayer reached his
conclusion on a voyage to the Dutch_East_Indies, where he found that his
patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less oxygen, and
therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter
climate. He discovered that heat and mechanical_work were both forms of energy
and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph
that stated a quantitative relationship between them.[13]
Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending
weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.
Meanwhile, in 1843, James_Prescott_Joule independently discovered the
mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now
called the "Joule apparatus", a descending weight attached to a string caused a
paddle immersed in water to rotate. He showed that the gravitational potential
energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the internal_energy gained
by the water through friction with the paddle.
Over the period 1840â1843, similar work was carried out by engineer Ludwig_A.
Colding, although it was little known outside his native Denmark.
Both Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was
Joule's that eventually drew the wider recognition.
For the dispute between Joule and Mayer over priority, see Mechanical
equivalent_of_heat:_Priority.
In 1844, William_Robert_Grove postulated a relationship between mechanics,
heat, light, electricity and magnetism by treating them all as manifestations
of a single "force" (energy in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his
theories in his book The Correlation of Physical Forces.[14] In 1847, drawing
on the earlier work of Joule, Sadi_Carnot and Ãmile_Clapeyron, Hermann_von
Helmholtz arrived at conclusions similar to Grove's and published his theories
in his book Ãber die Erhaltung der Kraft (On the Conservation of Force, 1847).
[15] The general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this
publication.
In 1850, William_Rankine first used the phrase the law of the conservation of
energy for the principle.[16]
In 1877, Peter_Guthrie_Tait claimed that the principle originated with Sir
Isaac Newton, based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the
Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica. This is now regarded as an
example of Whig_history.[17]

Main article: Massâenergy_equivalence
Matter is composed of such things as atoms, electrons, neutrons, and protons.
It has intrinsic_or_rest_mass. In the limited range of recognized experience of
the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved.
Einstein's 1905 theory of special_relativity showed that it corresponds to an
equivalent amount of rest energy. This means that it can be converted to or
from equivalent amounts of other (non-material) forms of energy, for example
kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this
happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not
conserved, unlike the total_mass or total energy. All forms of energy
contribute to the total mass and total energy.
For example, an electron and a positron each have rest mass. They can perish
together, converting their combined rest energy into photons having
electromagnetic radiant energy, but no rest mass. If this occurs within an
isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the
external surroundings, then neither the total mass nor the total energy of the
system will change. The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes
just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest
mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material
forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.
Thus, conservation of energy (total, including material or rest energy), and
conservation_of_mass (total, not just rest), each still holds as an
(equivalent) law. In the 18th century these had appeared as two seemingly-
distinct laws.
**** Conservation of energy in beta decay[edit] ****
Main article: Beta_decay_Â§ Neutrinos_in_beta_decay
The discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in beta_decay have a continuous
rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy,
under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an
electron from a nucleus.[18][19] This problem was eventually resolved in 1933
by Enrico_Fermi who proposed the correct description_of_beta-decay as the
emission of both an electron and an antineutrino, which carries away the
apparently missing energy.[20][21]
***** First law of thermodynamics[edit] *****
Main article: First_law_of_thermodynamics
For a closed_thermodynamic_system, the first law of thermodynamics may be
stated as:
         &#x03B4; Q =  d  U + &#x03B4; W   {\displaystyle \delta Q=\mathrm {d}
      U+\delta W}  [\delta Q=\mathrm {d} U+\delta W], or equivalently,      d
      U = &#x03B4; Q &#x2212; &#x03B4; W ,   {\displaystyle \mathrm {d}
      U=\delta Q-\delta W,}  [\mathrm {d} U=\delta Q-\delta W,]
where     &#x03B4; Q   {\displaystyle \delta Q}  [\delta Q] is the quantity of
energy added to the system by a heating process,     &#x03B4; W
{\displaystyle \delta W}  [\delta W] is the quantity of energy lost by the
system due to work done by the system on its surroundings and      d  U
{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U}  [\mathrm {d} U] is the change in the internal
energy of the system.
The Î´'s before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe
an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the
d  U   {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U}  [\mathrm {d} U] increment of internal
energy (see Inexact_differential). Work and heat refer to kinds of process
which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy
U   {\displaystyle U}  [U] is a property of a particular state of the system
when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term "heat energy"
for     &#x03B4; Q   {\displaystyle \delta Q}  [\delta Q] means "that amount of
energy added as the result of heating" rather than referring to a particular
form of energy. Likewise, the term "work energy" for     &#x03B4; W
{\displaystyle \delta W}  [\delta W] means "that amount of energy lost as the
result of work". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by
a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one
cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy
has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being
heated or cooled, nor as the result of work being performed on or by the
system.
Entropy is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of
the possibility of conversion of heat into work.
For a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be
written:
         &#x03B4; W = P   d  V ,   {\displaystyle \delta W=P\,\mathrm {d} V,}
      [\delta W=P\,\mathrm {d} V,]
where     P   {\displaystyle P}  [P] is the pressure and     d V
{\displaystyle dV}  [dV] is a small change in the volume of the system, each of
which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is
idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called quasi-static, and regarded as
reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature
infinitesimally above the system temperature, then the heat energy may be
written
         &#x03B4; Q = T   d  S ,   {\displaystyle \delta Q=T\,\mathrm {d} S,}
      [\delta Q=T\,\mathrm {d} S,]
where     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] is the temperature and      d  S
{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} S}  [\mathrm {d} S] is a small change in the entropy
of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system.
If an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has
several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from
the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written:[22]
          d  U = &#x03B4; Q &#x2212; &#x03B4; W +  u &#x2032;   d M ,
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U=\delta Q-\delta W+u'\,dM,\,}  [\mathrm {d}
      U=\delta Q-\delta W+u'\,dM,\,]
where     d M   {\displaystyle dM}  [dM] is the added mass and      u &#x2032;
{\displaystyle u'}  [u'] is the internal energy per unit mass of the added
mass, measured in the surroundings before the process.
***** Noether's theorem[edit] *****
Main article: Noether's_theorem
Emmy_Noether (1882-1935) was an influential mathematician known for her
groundbreaking contributions to abstract_algebra and theoretical_physics.
The conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From
a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of Noether's
theorem, developed by Emmy_Noether in 1915 and first published in 1918. The
theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated
conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the
conserved quantity is called "energy". The energy conservation law is a
consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is implied by
the empirical fact that the laws_of_physics do not change with time itself.
Philosophically this can be stated as "nothing depends on time per se". In
other words, if the physical system is invariant under the continuous_symmetry
of time_translation then its energy (which is canonical_conjugate quantity to
time) is conserved. Conversely, systems which are not invariant under shifts in
time (an example, systems with time dependent potential energy) do not exhibit
conservation of energy â unless we consider them to exchange energy with
another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time
invariant again. Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such
physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory (including QED) in
the flat space-time.
***** Relativity[edit] *****
With the discovery of special_relativity by Henri_PoincarÃ© and Albert
Einstein, energy was proposed to be one component of an energy-momentum_4-
vector. Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of
this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen
from any given inertial_reference_frame. Also conserved is the vector length
(Minkowski_norm), which is the rest_mass for single particles, and the
invariant_mass for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are
separately summed before the length is calculatedâsee the article on
invariant_mass).
The relativistic energy of a single massive particle contains a term related to
its rest_mass in addition to its kinetic energy of motion. In the limit of zero
kinetic energy (or equivalently in the rest_frame) of a massive particle, or
else in the center_of_momentum_frame for objects or systems which retain
kinetic energy, the total_energy of particle or object (including internal
kinetic energy in systems) is related to its rest_mass or its invariant_mass
via the famous equation     E = m  c  2     {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}  [E=mc^
{2}].
Thus, the rule of conservation_of_energy_over_time_in_special_relativity
continues to hold, so long as the reference_frame of the observer is unchanged.
This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers
disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all
observers, is the invariant_mass, which is the minimal system mass and energy
that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the energyâmomentum
relation.
In general_relativity, energyâmomentum conservation is not well-defined
except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with
the aid of a stressâenergyâmomentum_pseudotensor. However, since
pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference
frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change
with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away
spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls.
In practice, some metrics such as the
FriedmannâLemaÃ®treâRobertsonâWalker_metric do not satisfy these
constraints and energy conservation is not well defined.[23] The theory of
general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation
of energy for the entire universe.
***** Quantum theory[edit] *****
In quantum_mechanics, energy of a quantum system is described by a self-adjoint
(or Hermitian) operator called the Hamiltonian, which acts on the Hilbert_space
(or a space of wave_functions) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-
independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not
change in time over the evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of
energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field
theory is ensured by the quantum Noether's_theorem for energy-momentum tensor
operator. Note that due to the lack of the (universal) time operator in quantum
theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in
contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in
specific cases (see Uncertainty_principle). Energy at each fixed time can in
principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the
time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a
well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.
