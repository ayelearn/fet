Shear is the response of a rock to deformation usually by compressive_stress
and forms particular textures. Shear can be homogeneous or non-homogeneous, and
may be pure_shear or simple_shear. Study of geological shear is related to the
study of structural_geology, rock_microstructure or rock_texture and fault
mechanics.
The process of shearing occurs within brittle, brittle-ductile, and ductile
rocks. Within purely brittle rocks, compressive stress results in fracturing
and simple faulting.

***** Rocks[edit] *****
Rocks typical of shear zones include mylonite, cataclasite, S-tectonite and L-
tectonite, pseudotachylite, certain breccias and highly foliated versions of
the wall_rocks.
***** Shear zone[edit] *****

Main article: Shear_zone
A shear zone is a tabular to sheetlike, planar or curviplanar zone composed of
rocks that are more highly strained than rocks adjacent to the zone. Typically
this is a type of fault, but it may be difficult to place a distinct fault
plane into the shear zone. Shear zones may form zones of much more intense
foliation, deformation, and folding. En_echelon_veins or fractures may be
observed within shear zones.
Many shear zones host ore deposits as they are a focus for hydrothermal_flow
through orogenic_belts. They may often show some form of retrograde
metamorphism from a peak metamorphic assemblage and are commonly metasomatised.
Shear zones can be only inches wide, or up to several kilometres wide. Often,
due to their structural control and presence at the edges of tectonic blocks,
shear zones are mappable units and form important discontinuities to separate
terranes. As such, many large and long shear zones are named, identical to
fault systems.
When the horizontal displacement of this faulting can be measured in the tens
or hundreds of kilometers of length, the fault is referred to as a megashear.
Megashears often indicate the edges of ancient tectonic plates.[1]
***** Mechanisms of shearing[edit] *****

The mechanisms of shearing depend on the pressure and temperature of the rock
and on the rate of shear which the rock is subjected to. The response of the
rock to these conditions determines how it accommodates the deformation.
Shear zones which occur in more brittle rheological_conditions (cooler, less
confining_pressure) or at high rates of strain, tend to fail by brittle
failure; breaking of minerals, which are ground up into a breccia with a milled
texture.
Shear zones which occur under brittle-ductile conditions can accommodate much
deformation by enacting a series of mechanisms which rely less on fracture of
the rock and occur within the minerals and the mineral lattices themselves.
Shear zones accommodate compressive_stress by movement on foliation planes.
Shearing at ductile conditions may occur by fracturing of minerals and growth
of sub-grain boundaries, as well as by lattice glide. This occurs particularly
on platy minerals, especially micas.
Mylonites are essentially ductile shear zones.
***** Microstructures of shear zones[edit] *****
Typical example of dextral_shear foliation in an L-S tectonite, with pencil
pointing in direction of shear sense. Note the sinusoidal nature of the shear
foliation.
During the initiation of shearing, a penetrative planar foliation is first
formed within the rock mass. This manifests as realignment of textural
features, growth and realignment of micas and growth of new minerals.
The incipient shear foliation typically forms normal to the direction of
principal shortening, and is diagnostic of the direction of shortening. In
symmetric shortening, objects flatten on this shear foliation much the same way
that a round ball of treacle flattens with gravity.
Within asymmetric shear zones, the behavior of an object undergoing shortening
is analogous to the ball of treacle being smeared as it flattens, generally
into an ellipse. Within shear zones with pronounced displacements a shear
foliation may form at a shallow angle to the gross plane of the shear zone.
This foliation ideally manifests as a sinusoidal set of foliations formed at a
shallow angle to the main shear foliation, and which curve into the main shear
foliation. Such rocks are known as L-S tectonites.
If the rock mass begins to undergo large degrees of lateral movement, the
strain ellipse lengthens into a cigar shaped volume. At this point shear
foliaions begin to break down into a rodding lineation or a stretch lineation.
Such rocks are known as L-tectonites.

has stretched the conglomerate pebbles into elongate cigar shaped rods.
***** Ductile shear microstructures[edit] *****

porphyroblast of garnet, mica fish and elongated minerals. This specimen was
from close to a shear zone in Norway (the Ose thrust), the garnet in the centre
(black) is approximately 2mm in diameter
Very distinctive textures form as a consequence of ductile shear. An important
group of microstructures observed in ductile shear zones are S-planes, C-planes
and C' planes.
    * S-planes or schistositÃ© planes are generally defined by a planar fabric
      caused by the alignment of micas or platy minerals. Define the flattened
      long-axis of the strain ellipse.
    * C-planes or cisaillement planes form parallel to the shear zone boundary.
      The angle between the C and S planes is always acute, and defines the
      shear sense. Generally, the lower the C-S angle the greater the strain.
    * The C' planes, also known as shear bands and secondary shear fabrics, are
      commonly observed in strongly foliated mylonites especially phyllonites,
      and form at an angle of about 20 degrees to the S-plane.
The sense of shear shown by both S-C and S-C' structures matches that of the
shear zone in which they are found.
Other microstructures which can give sense of shear include:
    * sigmoidal veins
    * mica_fish
    * rotated porphyroclasts
    * asymmetric boudins (Figure 1)
    * asymmetric folds
***** Transpression[edit] *****
Transpression regimes are formed during oblique collision of tectonic plates
and during non-orthogonal subduction. Typically a mixture of oblique-slip
thrust_faults and strike-slip or transform faults are formed. Microstructural
evidence of transpressional regimes can be rodding lineations, mylonites,
augen-structured gneisses, mica fish and so on.
A typical example of a transpression regime is the Alpine Fault zone of New
Zealand, where the oblique subduction of the Pacific_Plate under the Indo-
Australian_Plate is converted to oblique strike-slip movement. Here, the
orogenic_belt attains a trapezoidal shape dominated by oblique splay_faults,
steeply-dipping recumbent nappes and fault-bend folds.
The Alpine Schist of New Zealand is characterised by heavily crenulated and
sheared phyllite. It is being pushed up at the rate of 8 to 10 mm per year, and
the area is prone to large earthquakes with a south block up and west oblique
sense of movement.
***** Transtension[edit] *****
Transtension regimes are oblique tensional environments. Oblique, normal
geologic_fault and detachment faults in rift zones are the typical structural
manifestations of transtension conditions. Microstructural evidence of
transtension includes rodding or stretching_lineations, stretched
porphyroblasts, mylonites, etc.
