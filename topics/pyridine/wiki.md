Pyridine is a basic heterocyclic organic_compound with the chemical_formula
C5H5N. It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine_group (=CHâ)
replaced by a nitrogen atom. It is a highly flammable, weakly alkaline, water-
soluble liquid with a distinctive, unpleasant fish-like smell. Pyridine is
colorless, but older or impure samples can appear yellow. The pyridine ring
occurs in many important compounds, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals,
and vitamins. Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar. Today it is
synthesized on the scale of about 20,000 tonnes per year worldwide.[2]

Crystal structure of pyridine
The molecular electric_dipole_moment is 2.2 debyes.[6] Pyridine is diamagnetic
and has a diamagnetic_susceptibility of â48.7 Ã 10â6 cm3Â·molâ1.[9] The
standard_enthalpy_of_formation is 100.2 kJÂ·molâ1 in the liquid phase[10] and
140.4 kJÂ·molâ1 in the gas phase. At 25 Â°C pyridine has a viscosity[11] of
0.88 mPa/s and thermal_conductivity of 0.166 WÂ·mâ1Â·Kâ1.[12][13] The
enthalpy_of_vaporization is 35.09 kJÂ·molâ1 at the boiling_point and normal
pressure.[14] The enthalpy_of_fusion is 8.28 kJÂ·molâ1 at the melting_point.
[15]
The critical_parameters of pyridine are pressure 6.70 MPa, temperature 620 K
and volume 229 cm3Â·molâ1.[16] In the temperature range 340â426 Â°C its
vapor pressure p can be described with the Antoine_equation
          log  10   &#x2061; p = A &#x2212;   B  C + T      {\displaystyle \log
      _{10}p=A-{\frac {B}{C+T}}}  [\log_{10} p = A-\frac{B}{C+T}]
where T is temperature, A = 4.16272, B = 1371.358 K and C = â58.496 K.[17]
**** Structure[edit] ****
Akin to benzene, pyridine ring forms a C5N hexagon. Electron localization in
pyridine is reflected in the shorter CâN ring bond (137 pm for the CâN bond
in pyridine vs. 139 pm for CâC bond in benzene),[18] whereas the
carbonâcarbon bonds in the pyridine ring have the same 139 pm length as in
benzene. These bond lengths lie between the values for the single and double
bonds and are typical of aromatic compounds.
**** Crystallography[edit] ****
Pyridine crystallizes in an orthorhombic_crystal_system with space_group Pna21
and lattice parameters a = 1752 pm, b = 897 pm, c = 1135 pm, and 16 formula
units per unit_cell (measured at 153 K). For comparison, crystalline benzene is
also orthorhombic, with space group Pbca, a = 729.2 pm, b = 947.1 pm,
c = 674.2 pm (at 78 K), but the number of molecules per cell is only 4.[19]
This difference is partly related to the lower symmetry of the individual
pyridine molecule (C2v vs D6h for benzene). A trihydrate (pyridineÂ·3H2O) is
known; it also crystallizes in an orthorhombic system in the space group Pbca,
lattice parameters a = 1244 pm, b = 1783 pm, c = 679 pm and eight formula units
per unit cell (measured at 223 K).[20]
**** Spectroscopy[edit] ****
The optical absorption spectrum of pyridine in hexane contains three bands at
the wavelengths of 195 nm (Ï â Ï* transition, molar_absorptivity
Îµ = 7500 LÂ·molâ1Â·cmâ1), 251 nm (Ï â Ï* transition,
Îµ = 2000 LÂ·molâ1Â·cmâ1) and 270 nm (n â Ï* transition,
Îµ = 450 LÂ·molâ1Â·cmâ1).[21] The 1H nuclear_magnetic_resonance (NMR)
spectrum of pyridine contains three signals with the integral intensity ratio
of 2:1:2 that correspond to the three chemically different protons in the
molecule. These signals originate from the Î±-protons (positions 2 and 6,
chemical_shift 8.5 ppm), Î³-proton (position 4, 7.5 ppm) and Î²-protons
(positions 3 and 5, 7.1 ppm). The carbon analog of pyridine, benzene, has only
one proton signal at 7.27 ppm. The larger chemical shifts of the Î±- and Î³-
protons in comparison to benzene result from the lower electron density in the
Î±- and Î³-positions, which can be derived from the resonance structures. The
situation is rather similar for the 13C NMR spectra of pyridine and benzene:
pyridine shows a triplet at Î´(Î±-C) = 150 ppm, Î´(Î²-C) = 124 ppm and Î´(Î³-
C) = 136 ppm, whereas benzene has a single line at 129 ppm. All shifts are
quoted for the solvent-free substances.[22] Pyridine is conventionally detected
by the gas_chromatography and mass_spectrometry methods.[23]
**** Chemical properties[edit] ****
Because of the electronegative nitrogen in the pyridine ring, the molecule is
relatively electron deficient. It, therefore, enters less readily into
electrophilic_aromatic_substitution reactions than benzene derivatives.
Correspondingly pyridine is more prone to nucleophilic_substitution, as
evidenced by the ease of metalation by strong organometallic bases.[24][25] The
reactivity of pyridine can be distinguished for three chemical groups. With
electrophiles, electrophilic_substitution takes place where pyridine expresses
aromatic properties. With nucleophiles, pyridine reacts at positions 2 and 4
and thus behaves similar to imines and carbonyls. The reaction with many Lewis
acids results in the addition to the nitrogen atom of pyridine, which is
similar to the reactivity of tertiary amines. The ability of pyridine and its
derivatives to oxidize, forming amine_oxides (N-oxides), is also a feature of
tertiary amines.[26]
The nitrogen center of pyridine features a basic lone_pair of electrons. This
lone pair does not overlap with the aromatic Ï-system ring, consequently
pyridine is a basic, having chemical properties similar to those of tertiary
amines. Protonation gives pyridinium, C5H5NH+.The pKa of the conjugate_acid
(the pyridinium cation) is 5.25. The structures of pyridine and pyridinium are
almost identical.[27] The pyridinium cation is isoelectronic with benzene.
Pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (PPTS) is an illustrative pyridinium salt; it is
produced by treating pyridine with p-toluenesulfonic_acid. In addition to
protonation, pyridine undergoes N-centered alkylation, acylation, and N-
oxidation.
**** Bonding[edit] ****
Pyridine with its free electron pair
Pyridine has a conjugated system of six Ï_electrons that are delocalized over
the ring. The molecule is planar and, thus, follows the HÃ¼ckel_criteria for
aromatic systems. In contrast to benzene, the electron_density is not evenly
distributed over the ring, reflecting the negative inductive_effect of the
nitrogen atom. For this reason, pyridine has a dipole moment and a weaker
resonant_stabilization than benzene (resonance_energy 117 kJÂ·molâ1 in
pyridine vs. 150 kJÂ·molâ1 in benzene).[28]
The ring atoms in the pyridine molecule are sp2-hybridized. The nitrogen is
involved in the Ï-bonding aromatic system using its unhybridized p orbital.
The lone_pair is in an sp2 orbital, projecting outward from the ring in the
same plane as the Ï_bonds. As a result, the lone pair does not contribute to
the aromatic system but importantly influences the chemical properties of
pyridine, as it easily supports bond formation via an electrophilic attack.
However, because of the separation of the lone pair from the aromatic ring
system, the nitrogen atom cannot exhibit a positive mesomeric_effect.
Many analogues of pyridine are known where N is replaced by other heteroatoms
(see figure below). Substitution of one CâH in pyridine with a second N gives
rise to the diazine heterocycles (C4H4N2), with the names pyridazine,
pyrimidine, and pyrazine.

***** History[edit] *****
Thomas_Anderson
Impure pyridine was undoubtedly prepared by early alchemists by heating animal
bones and other organic matter,[29] but the earliest documented reference is
attributed to the Scottish scientist Thomas_Anderson.[30][31] In 1849, Anderson
examined the contents of the oil obtained through high-temperature heating of
animal bones.[31] Among other substances, he separated from the oil, a
colorless liquid with unpleasant odor, from which he isolated pure pyridine two
years later. He described it as highly soluble in water, readily soluble in
concentrated acids and salts upon heating, and only slightly soluble in oils.
Owing to its flammability, Anderson named the new substance pyridine, after
Greek: Ïá¿¦Ï (pyr) meaning fire. The suffix idine was added in compliance
with the chemical nomenclature, as in toluidine, to indicate a cyclic_compound
containing a nitrogen atom.[32][33]
The chemical structure of pyridine was determined decades after its discovery.
Wilhelm_KÃ¶rner (1869)[34] and James_Dewar (1871)[35][36] suggested that, in
analogy between quinoline and naphthalene, the structure of pyridine is derived
from benzene by substituting one CâH unit with a nitrogen atom.[37][38] The
suggestion by KÃ¶rner and Dewar was later confirmed in an experiment where
pyridine was reduced to piperidine with sodium in ethanol.[39] In 1876, William
Ramsay combined acetylene and hydrogen_cyanide into pyridine in a red-hot iron-
tube furnace.[40] This was the first synthesis of a heteroaromatic compound.
[23][41]
The first major synthesis of pyridine derivatives was described in 1881 by
Arthur_Rudolf_Hantzsch.[42] The Hantzsch_pyridine_synthesis typically uses a 2:
1:1 mixture of a Î²-keto_acid (often acetoacetate), an aldehyde (often
formaldehyde), and ammonia or its salt as the nitrogen donor. First, a double
hydrogenated pyridine is obtained, which is then oxidized to the corresponding
pyridine derivative. Emil_Knoevenagel showed that asymmetrically-substituted
pyridine derivatives can be produced with this process.[43]
Hantzsch_pyridine_synthesis with acetoacetate, formaldehyde and ammonium
acetate, and iron(III)_chloride as the oxidizer.
The contemporary methods of pyridine production had a low yield, and the
increasing demand for the new compound urged to search for more efficient
routes. A breakthrough came in 1924 when the Russian chemist Aleksei
Chichibabin invented a pyridine_synthesis_reaction, which was based on
inexpensive reagents.[44] This method is still used for the industrial
production of pyridine.[2]
***** Occurrence[edit] *****
Pyridine is not abundant in nature, except for the leaves and roots of
belladonna (Atropa_belladonna)[45] and in marshmallow (Althaea_officinalis).
[46] Pyridine derivatives, however, are often part of biomolecules such as the
eponymous pyridine nucleotides and alkaloids.
In daily life, trace amounts of pyridine are components of the volatile_organic
compounds that are produced in roasting and canning processes, e.g. in fried
chicken,[47] sukiyaki,[48] roasted coffee,[49] potato chips,[50] and fried
bacon.[51] Traces of pyridine can be found in Beaufort_cheese,[52] vaginal
secretions,[53] black_tea,[54] saliva of those suffering from gingivitis,[55]
and sunflower_honey.[56]

***** Production[edit] *****
Historically, pyridine was extracted from coal_tar or obtained as a byproduct
of coal gasification. The process was labor-consuming and inefficient: coal_tar
contains only about 0.1% pyridine,[57] and therefore a multi-stage purification
was required, which further reduced the output. Nowadays, most pyridine is
produced synthetically using various name_reactions, and the major ones are
discussed below.[2]
In 1989, 26,000 tonnes of pyridine was produced worldwide.[2] Among the largest
25 production sites for pyridine, eleven are located in Europe (as of 1999).
[23] The major producers of pyridine include Evonik_Industries, RÃ¼tgers
Chemicals, Jubilant Life Sciences, Imperial_Chemical_Industries, and Koei
Chemical.[2] Pyridine production significantly increased in the early 2000s,
with an annual production capacity of 30,000 tonnes in mainland China alone.
[58] The USâChinese joint venture Vertellus is currently the world leader in
pyridine production.[59]
**** Chichibabin synthesis[edit] ****
The Chichibabin_pyridine_synthesis was reported in 1924 and is still in use in
industry.[44] In its general form, the reaction can be described as a
condensation_reaction of aldehydes, ketones, Î±,Î²-unsaturated_carbonyl
compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia_derivatives.
[60] In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and
acetaldehyde, which are inexpensive and widely available. First, acrolein is
formed in a Knoevenagel_condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde.
The acrolein is then condensed with acetaldehyde and ammonia to give
dihydropyridine, which is oxidized with a solid-state catalyst to pyridine.
This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400â450 Â°C. The product
consists of a mixture of pyridine, simple methylated pyridines (picolines and
lutidines); its composition depends on the catalyst used and can be adapted to
the needs of the manufacturer. The catalyst is usually a transition metal salt
such as cadmium(II)_fluoride or manganese(II)_fluoride, but cobalt and thallium
compounds can also be used. The recovered pyridine is separated from byproducts
in a multistage process.[2]

Condensation of pyridine from acrolein and acetaldehyde
Practical application of the traditional Chichibabin pyridine synthesis are
limited by its consistently low yield, typically about 20%. This low yield,
together with the high prevalence of byproducts, render unmodified forms of
Chichibabin's method unpopular.[60]
**** Dealkylation of alkylpyridines[edit] ****
Pyridine can be prepared by dealkylation of alkylated pyridines, which are
obtained as byproducts in the syntheses of other pyridines. The oxidative
dealkylation is carried out either using air over vanadium(V)_oxide catalyst,
[61] by vapor-dealkylation on nickel-based catalyst,[62][63] or
hydrodealkylation with a silver- or platinum-based catalyst.[64] Yields of
pyridine up to be 93% can be achieved with the nickel-based catalyst.[2]
**** BÃ¶nnemann cyclization[edit] ****
BÃ¶nnemann cyclization
The trimerization of a part of a nitrile molecule and two parts of acetylene
into pyridine is called BÃ¶nnemann cyclization. This modification of the Reppe
synthesis can be activated either by heat or by light. While the thermal
activation requires high pressures and temperatures, the photoinduced
cycloaddition proceeds at ambient conditions with CoCp2(cod) (Cp =
cyclopentadienyl, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) as a catalyst, and can be performed
even in water.[65] A series of pyridine derivatives can be produced in this
way. When using acetonitrile as the nitrile, 2-methylpyridine is obtained,
which can be dealkylated to pyridine.
**** Other methods[edit] ****
The KrÃ¶hnke_pyridine_synthesis provides a fairly general method for generating
substituted pyridines using pyridine itself as a reagent which does not become
incorporated into the final product. The reaction of pyridine with Î±-
bromoesters give the related pyridinium salt, wherein the methylene_group is
highly acidic. This species undergoes a Michael-like_addition to Î±,Î²-
unsaturated carbonyls in the presence of ammonium_acetate to undergo ring
closure and formation of the targeted substituted pyridine as well as
pyridinium bromide.[66]

The CiamicianâDennstedt rearrangement entails the ring-expansion of pyrrole
with dichlorocarbene to 3-chloropyridine.[67][68][69]
[CiamicianâDennstedt_Rearrangement]
In the GattermannâSkita synthesis,[70] a malonate_ester salt reacts with
dichloromethylamine.[71]
[GattermannâSkita_synthesis]
Another method is the Boger_pyridine_synthesis.
Pyridine can also be produced by the decarboxylation of nicotinic_acid with
copper_chromite.[72]
**** Biosynthesis[edit] ****
Several pyridine derivatives play important roles in biological systems. While
its biosynthesis is not fully understood, nicotinic_acid (vitamin B3) occurs in
some bacteria, fungi, and mammals. Mammals synthesize nicotinic acid through
oxidation of the amino_acid tryptophan, where an intermediate product, aniline,
creates a pyridine derivative, kynurenine. On the contrary, the bacteria
Mycobacterium_tuberculosis and Escherichia_coli produce nicotinic acid by
condensation of glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate and aspartic_acid.[73]
***** Reactions[edit] *****
Despite the structural and bonding commonalities of benzene and pyridine, their
reactivity differ significantly. Instead, in terms of its reactivity, pyridine
more closely resembles nitrobenzene.[74]
**** Electrophilic substitutions[edit] ****
Owing to the decreased electron density in the aromatic system, electrophilic
substitutions are suppressed in pyridine and its derivatives. FriedelâCrafts
alkylation_or_acylation, usually fail for pyridine because they lead only to
the addition at the nitrogen atom. Substitutions usually occur at the 3-
position, which is the most electron-rich carbon atom in the ring and is,
therefore, more susceptible to an electrophilic addition.

Direct nitration of pyridine is sluggish.[75][76] Pyridine derivatives wherein
the nitrogen atom is screened sterically and/or electronically can be obtained
by nitration with nitronium_tetrafluoroborate (NO2BF4). In this way, 3-
nitropyridine can be obtained via the synthesis of 2,6-dibromopyridine followed
by debromination.[77][78]
Sulfonation of pyridine is even more difficult than nitration. However,
pyridine-3-sulfonic acid can be obtained. Reaction with the SO3 group also
facilitates addition of sulfur to the nitrogen atom, especially in the presence
of a mercury(II)_sulfate catalyst.[24][79]
In contrast to the sluggish nitrations and sulfonations, the bromination and
chlorination of pyridine proceed well.[2]

*** Pyridine-N-oxide[edit] ***
Structure of pyridine N-oxide
Oxidation of pyridine occurs at nitrogen to give pyridine-N-oxide. The
oxidation can be achieved with peracids:[80]
      C5H5N + RCO3H → C5H5NO + RCO2H
Some electrophilic substitutions on the pyridine are usefully effected using
pyridine-N-oxide followed by deoxygenation. Addition of oxygen suppresses
further reactions at nitrogen atom and promotes substitution at the 2- and 4-
carbons. The oxygen atom can then be removed, e.g. using zinc dust.[81]
**** Nucleophilic substitutions[edit] ****
In contrast to benzene ring, pyridine efficiently supports several nucleophilic
substitutions. The reason for this is relatively lower electron density of the
carbon atoms of the ring. These reactions include substitutions with
elimination of a hydride ion and elimination-additions with formation of an
intermediate aryne configuration, and usually proceed at the 2- or 4-position.
[24][25]
[Nucleophilic_substitution_in_2-position]
[Nucleophilic_substitution_in_3-position]
[Nucleophilic_substitution_in_4-position]
Many nucleophilic substitutions occur more easily not with bare pyridine but
with pyridine modified with bromine, chlorine, fluorine, or sulfonic acid
fragments that then become a leaving group. So fluorine is the best leaving
group for the substitution with organolithium_compounds. The nucleophilic
attack compounds may be alkoxides, thiolates, amines, and ammonia (at elevated
pressures).[82]
In general, the hydride ion is a poor leaving group and occurs only in a few
heterocyclic reactions. They include the Chichibabin_reaction, which yields
pyridine derivatives aminated at the 2-position. Here, sodium_amide is used as
the nucleophile yielding 2-aminopyridine. The hydride ion released in this
reaction combines with a proton of an available amino group, forming a hydrogen
molecule.[25][83]
Analogous to benzene, nucleophilic substitutions to pyridine can result in the
formation of pyridyne intermediates as heteroaryne. For this purpose, pyridine
derivatives can be eliminated with good leaving groups using strong bases such
as sodium and potassium_tert-butoxide. The subsequent addition of a nucleophile
to the triple_bond has low selectivity, and the result is a mixture of the two
possible adducts.[24]
**** Radical reactions[edit] ****
Pyridine supports a series of radical reactions, which is used in its
dimerization to bipyridines. Radical dimerization of pyridine with elemental
sodium or Raney_nickel selectively yields 4,4â²-bipyridine,[84] or 2,2â²-
bipyridine,[85] which are important precursor reagents in the chemical
industry. One of the name_reactions involving free radicals is the Minisci
reaction. It can produce 2-tert-butylpyridine upon reacting pyridine with
pivalic_acid, silver_nitrate and ammonium in sulfuric_acid with a yield of 97%.
[24]
**** Reactions on the nitrogen atom[edit] ****
Additions of various Lewis_acids to pyridine
Lewis_acids easily add to the nitrogen atom of pyridine, forming pyridinium
salts. The reaction with alkyl_halides leads to alkylation of the nitrogen
atom. This creates a positive charge in the ring that increases the reactivity
of pyridine to both oxidation and reduction. The Zincke_reaction is used for
the selective introduction of radicals in pyridinium compounds (it has no
relation to the chemical element zinc).
**** Hydrogenation and reduction[edit] ****
Reduction of pyridine to piperidine with Raney_nickel
Piperidine is produced by hydrogenation of pyridine with a nickel-, cobalt-, or
ruthenium-based catalyst at elevated temperatures.[86] The hydrogenation of
pyridine to piperidine releases 193.8 kJÂ·molâ1,[87] which is slightly less
than the energy of the hydrogenation of benzene (205.3 kJÂ·molâ1).[87]
Partially hydrogenated derivatives are obtained under milder conditions. For
example, reduction with lithium_aluminium_hydride yields a mixture of 1,4-
dihydropyridine, 1,2-dihydropyridine, and 2,5-dihydropyridine.[88] Selective
synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine is achieved in the presence of organometallic
complexes of magnesium and zinc,[89] and (Î3,4)-tetrahydropyridine is obtained
by electrochemical reduction of pyridine.[90]
**** Lewis basicity and coordination compounds[edit] ****
Pyridine is a Lewis_base, donating its pair of electrons to a Lewis acid. One
example is the sulfur_trioxide_pyridine_complex (melting point 175 Â°C), which
is a sulfation agent used to convert alcohols to sulfate_esters. Pyridine-
borane (C5H5NBH3, melting point 10â11 Â°C) is a mild reducing agent.
structure of the Crabtree's_catalyst
Pyridine forms numerous complexes with transition_metals.[91][92] Typical
octahedral complexes have the stoichiometry MCl2(py)4 and MCl3(py)3. Octahedral
homoleptic complexes of the type M(py)6+ are rare or tend to dissociate
pyridine. Numerous square planar complexes are known, such as Crabtree's
catalyst.[93] The pyridine ligand replaced during the reaction is restored
after its completion.
The Î·6 coordination mode, as occurs in Î·6 benzene complexes, is observed only
in sterically_encumbered derivatives that block the nitrogen center.[18]
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Pesticides[edit] ****
The main use of pyridine is as a precursor to the herbicides paraquat and
diquat.[2] The first synthesis step of insecticide chlorpyrifos consists of the
chlorination of pyridine. Pyridine is also the starting compound for the
preparation of pyrithione-based fungicides.[23] Cetylpyridinium and
laurylpyridinium, which can be produced from pyridine with a Zincke_reaction,
are used as antiseptic in oral and dental care products.[6] Pyridine is easily
attacked by alkylating agents to give N-alkylpyridinium salts. One example is
cetylpyridinium_chloride.
Synthesis of paraquat[94]
**** Solvent[edit] ****
Pyridine is used as a polar, basic, low-reactive solvent, for example in
Knoevenagel_condensations.[23] It is especially suitable for the
dehalogenation, where it acts as the base of the elimination_reaction and bonds
the resulting hydrogen halide to form a pyridinium salt. In esterifications and
acylations, pyridine activates the carboxylic_acid halides or anhydrides. Even
more active in these reactions are the pyridine derivatives 4-
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 4-(1-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine. Pyridine is also
used as a base in condensation_reactions.[95]
Elimination reaction with pyridine to form pyridinium
It is also used in the textile industry to improve network capacity of cotton.
[6]
**** Specialty reagents based on pyridine[edit] ****
Oxidation of an alcohol to aldehyde with the Collins_reagent.
As a base, pyridine can be used as the Karl_Fischer_reagent, but it is usually
replaced by alternatives with a more pleasant odor, such as imidazole.[96]
Pyridinium_chlorochromate, pyridinium_dichromate, and the Collins_reagent (the
complex of chromium(VI)_oxide are used for the oxidation of alcohols.[97]
***** Hazards[edit] *****
Pyridine is added to ethanol to make it unsuitable for drinking.[6] In low
doses, pyridine is added to foods to give them a bitter flavor, and such usage
was approved by the US Food_and_Drug_Administration[23] and is still considered
safe by the agency even though external lobbying forced it to ban pyridine's
use as a synthetic flavor in 2018.[98][99] The detection threshold for pyridine
in solutions is about 1â3 mmolÂ·Lâ1 (79â237 mgÂ·Lâ1).[100]
Pyridine has a flash_point of 17 Â°C and is, therefore, highly flammable. Its
ignition temperature is 550 Â°C, and mixtures of 1.7â10.6 vol% of pyridine
with air are explosive. The thermal modification of pyridine starts above
490 Â°C, resulting in bipyridine (mainly 2,2â²-bipyridine and to a lesser
extent 2,3â²-bipyridine and 2,4â²-bipyridine), nitrogen_oxides, and carbon
monoxide.[13] Pyridine easily dissolves in water and harms both animals and
plants in aquatic systems.[101] The permitted maximum_allowable_concentration
of pyridine was 15â30 parts per million (ppm, or 15â30 mgÂ·mâ3 in air) in
most countries in the 1990s,[23] but was reduced to 5 ppm in the 2000s.[102]
For comparison, indoor air contaminated with tobacco smoke may contain up to
16 ÂµgÂ·mâ3 of pyridine, and one cigarette contains 21â32 Âµg.[23]
**** Health issues[edit] ****
Metabolism of pyridine
Pyridine is harmful if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through the skin.[103]
Effects of acute pyridine intoxication include dizziness, headache, lack_of
coordination, nausea, salivation, and loss of appetite. They may progress into
abdominal pain, pulmonary_congestion and unconsciousness.[104] One person died
after accidental ingestion of half a cup of pyridine.[23] The lowest known
lethal_dose (LDLo) for the ingestion of pyridine in humans is 500 mgÂ·kgâ1.
In high doses, pyridine has a narcotic effect and its vapor concentrations of
above 3600 ppm pose a health risk.[2] The oral LD50 in rats is 891 mgÂ·kgâ1.
Pyridine is flammable.
Evaluations as a possible carcinogenic agent showed that there is inadequate
evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of pyridine, although there is
limited evidence of carcinogenic effects on animals.[104] Available data
indicate that "exposure to pyridine in drinking-water led to reduction of sperm
motility at all dose levels in mice and increased estrous cycle length at the
highest dose level in rats".[104]
Pyridine might also have minor neurotoxic, genotoxic, and clastogenic effects.
[13][23][105] Exposure to pyridine would normally lead to its inhalation and
absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains
unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are N-
methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by N-methyltransferases (e.g.,
pyridine_N-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine N-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-
hydroxypyridine, which are generated by the action of monooxygenase. In humans,
pyridine is metabolized only into N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide.[13][105]
Pyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide.[106]
The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than picoline, lutidine,
chloropyridine, or aminopyridines,[107] and a number of pyridine degraders have
been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine.[108]
Ionizable N-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with
environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent
mechanisms, including partitioning to soil_organic_matter, cation_exchange, and
surface complexation.[109] Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability
of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing
degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.[110]
Minor amounts of pyridine are released into environment from some industrial
processes such as steel manufacture,[111] processing of oil_shale, coal
gasification, coking plants and incinerators.[23] The atmosphere at oil shale
processing plants can contain pyridine concentrations of up to 13 ÂµgÂ·mâ3,
[112] and 53 ÂµgÂ·mâ3 levels were measured in the groundwater in the vicinity
of a coal gasification plant.[113] According to a study by the US National
Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health, about 43,000 Americans work in
contact with pyridine.[114]
***** Nomenclature[edit] *****
The systematic name of pyridine, within the HantzschâWidman_nomenclature
recommended by the IUPAC, is azinine. However, systematic names for simple
compounds are used very rarely; instead, heterocyclic nomenclature follows
historically established common names. IUPAC discourages the use of azinine/
azine in favor of pyridine.[115] The numbering of the ring atoms in pyridine
starts at the nitrogen (see infobox). An allocation of positions by letter of
the Greek_alphabet (Î±-Î³) and the substitution_pattern nomenclature common for
homoaromatic systems (ortho, meta, para) are used sometimes. Here Î± (ortho),
Î² (meta), and Î³ (para) refer to the 2, 3, and 4 position, respectively. The
systematic name for the pyridine derivatives is pyridinyl, wherein the position
of the substituted atom is preceded by a number. However, the historical name
pyridyl is encouraged by the IUPAC and used instead of the systematic name.
[116] The cationic derivative formed by the addition of an electrophile to the
nitrogen atom is called pyridinium.
