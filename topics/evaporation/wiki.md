Aerosol of microscopic water droplets suspended in the air above a hot cup of
tea after that water vapor has sufficiently cooled and condensed. Water_vapor
is an invisible gas, but the clouds of condensed water droplets refract and
disperse the sun light and so are visible.

Demonstration of evaporative cooling. When the sensor is dipped in ethanol and
then taken out to evaporate, the instrument shows progressively lower
temperature as the ethanol evaporates.
Evaporation is a type of vaporization that occurs on the surface of a liquid as
it changes into the gas phase.[1] The surrounding gas must not be saturated
with the evaporating substance. When the molecules of the liquid collide, they
transfer energy to each other based on how they collide with each other. When a
molecule near the surface absorbs enough energy to overcome the vapor_pressure,
it will escape and enter the surrounding air as a gas.[2] When evaporation
occurs, the energy removed from the vaporized liquid will reduce the
temperature of the liquid, resulting in evaporative cooling.[3]
On average, only a fraction of the molecules in a liquid have enough heat
energy to escape from the liquid. The evaporation will continue until an
equilibrium is reached when the evaporation of the liquid is equal to its
condensation. In an enclosed environment, a liquid will evaporate until the
surrounding air is saturated.
Evaporation is an essential part of the water_cycle. The sun (solar energy)
drives evaporation of water from oceans, lakes, moisture in the soil, and other
sources of water. In hydrology, evaporation and transpiration (which involves
evaporation within plant stomata) are collectively termed evapotranspiration.
Evaporation of water occurs when the surface of the liquid is exposed, allowing
molecules to escape and form water vapor; this vapor can then rise up and form
clouds. With sufficient energy, the liquid will turn into vapor.

***** Theory *****
See also: Kinetic_theory_of_gases
For molecules of a liquid to evaporate, they must be located near the surface,
they have to be moving in the proper direction, and have sufficient kinetic
energy to overcome liquid-phase intermolecular_forces.[4] When only a small
proportion of the molecules meet these criteria, the rate of evaporation is
low. Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature,
evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures. As the faster-moving
molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy,
and the temperature of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon is also called
evaporative_cooling. This is why evaporating sweat cools the human body.
Evaporation also tends to proceed more quickly with higher flow rates between
the gaseous and liquid phase and in liquids with higher vapor_pressure. For
example, laundry on a clothes line will dry (by evaporation) more rapidly on a
windy day than on a still day. Three key parts to evaporation are heat,
atmospheric_pressure (determines the percent humidity), and air movement.
On a molecular level, there is no strict boundary between the liquid state and
the vapor state. Instead, there is a Knudsen_layer, where the phase is
undetermined. Because this layer is only a few molecules thick, at a
macroscopic scale a clear phase transition interface cannot be seen.[citation
needed]
Liquids that do not evaporate visibly at a given temperature in a given gas
(e.g., cooking oil at room temperature) have molecules that do not tend to
transfer energy to each other in a pattern sufficient to frequently give a
molecule the heat energy necessary to turn into vapor. However, these liquids
are evaporating. It is just that the process is much slower and thus
significantly less visible.
**** Evaporative equilibrium ****
Vapor pressure of water vs. temperature. 760 Torr = 1 atm.
If evaporation takes place in an enclosed area, the escaping molecules
accumulate as a vapor above the liquid. Many of the molecules return to the
liquid, with returning molecules becoming more frequent as the density and
pressure of the vapor increases. When the process of escape and return reaches
an equilibrium,[4] the vapor is said to be "saturated", and no further change
in either vapor_pressure and density or liquid temperature will occur. For a
system consisting of vapor and liquid of a pure substance, this equilibrium
state is directly related to the vapor pressure of the substance, as given by
the ClausiusâClapeyron_relation:
         ln &#x2061;  (    P  2    P  1     )  = &#x2212;    &#x0394;  H  v a p
      R    (    1  T  2     &#x2212;   1  T  1      )    {\displaystyle \ln
      \left({\frac {P_{2}}{P_{1}}}\right)=-{\frac {\Delta H_{vap}}{R}}\left(
      {\frac {1}{T_{2}}}-{\frac {1}{T_{1}}}\right)}  [\ln \left( \frac{ P_2 }
      { P_1 } \right) = - \frac{ \Delta H_{ vap } }{ R } \left( \frac{ 1 }{ T_2
      } - \frac{ 1 }{ T_1 }  \right)]

where P1, P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1, T2 respectively,
ÎHvap is the enthalpy_of_vaporization, and R is the universal_gas_constant.
The rate of evaporation in an open system is related to the vapor pressure
found in a closed system. If a liquid is heated, when the vapor pressure
reaches the ambient pressure the liquid will boil.
The ability for a molecule of a liquid to evaporate is based largely on the
amount of kinetic_energy an individual particle may possess. Even at lower
temperatures, individual molecules of a liquid can evaporate if they have more
than the minimum amount of kinetic energy required for vaporization.
***** Factors influencing the rate of evaporation *****
Note: Air used here is a common example; however, the vapor phase can be other
gases.
  Concentration of the substance evaporating in the air
      If the air already has a high concentration of the substance evaporating,
      then the given substance will evaporate more slowly.
  Flow rate of air
      This is in part related to the concentration points above. If "fresh" air
      (i.e., air which is neither already saturated with the substance nor with
      other substances) is moving over the substance all the time, then the
      concentration of the substance in the air is less likely to go up with
      time, thus encouraging faster evaporation. This is the result of the
      boundary_layer at the evaporation surface decreasing with flow velocity,
      decreasing the diffusion distance in the stagnant layer.
  The amount of minerals dissolved in the liquid
  Inter-molecular forces
      The stronger the forces keeping the molecules together in the liquid
      state, the more energy one must get to escape. This is characterized by
      the enthalpy_of_vaporization.
  Pressure
      Evaporation happens faster if there is less exertion on the surface
      keeping the molecules from launching themselves.
  Surface_area
      A substance that has a larger surface area will evaporate faster, as
      there are more surface molecules per unit of volume that are potentially
      able to escape.
  Temperature of the substance
      the higher the temperature of the substance the greater the kinetic
      energy of the molecules at its surface and therefore the faster the rate
      of their evaporation.
In the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation
from a standardized "pan" open water surface outdoors, at various locations
nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and
compiled into an annual evaporation map. The measurements range from under 30
to over 120 inches (3,000 mm) per year.
***** Thermodynamics *****
Evaporation is an endothermic_process, in that heat is absorbed during
evaporation.
***** Applications *****
    * Industrial applications include many printing and coating processes;
      recovering salts from solutions; and drying a variety of materials such
      as lumber, paper, cloth and chemicals.
    * The use of evaporation to dry or concentrate samples is a common
      preparatory step for many laboratory analyses such as spectroscopy and
      chromatography. Systems used for this purpose include rotary_evaporators
      and centrifugal_evaporators.
    * When clothes are hung on a laundry line, even though the ambient
      temperature is below the boiling point of water, water evaporates. This
      is accelerated by factors such as low humidity, heat (from the sun), and
      wind. In a clothes_dryer, hot air is blown through the clothes, allowing
      water to evaporate very rapidly.

      storing and cooling water and other liquids.
    * The botijo, a traditional Spanish porous clay container designed to cool
      the contained water by evaporation.
    * Evaporative_coolers, which can significantly cool a building by simply
      blowing dry air over a filter saturated with water.
**** Combustion vaporization ****
Fuel droplets vaporize as they receive heat by mixing with the hot gases in the
combustion chamber. Heat (energy) can also be received by radiation from any
hot refractory wall of the combustion chamber.
**** Pre-combustion vaporization ****
Internal combustion engines rely upon the vaporization of the fuel in the
cylinders to form a fuel/air mixture in order to burn well. The chemically
correct air/fuel mixture for total burning of gasoline has been determined to
be 15 parts air to one part gasoline or 15/1 by weight. Changing this to a
volume ratio yields 8000 parts air to one part gasoline or 8,000/1 by volume.
**** Film deposition ****
Main article: Evaporation_(deposition)
Thin_films may be deposited by evaporating a substance and condensing it onto a
substrate, or by dissolving the substance in a solvent, spreading the resulting
solution thinly over a substrate, and evaporating the solvent. The
HertzâKnudsen_equation is often used to estimate the rate of evaporation in
these instances.
