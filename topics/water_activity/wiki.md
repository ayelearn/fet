This article is about food science. For a more general discussion, see
thermodynamic_activity.
Water activity or aw is the partial vapor_pressure of water in a substance
divided by the standard state partial vapor_pressure_of_water. In the field of
food_science, the standard state is most often defined as the partial vapor
pressure of pure water at the same temperature. Using this particular
definition, pure distilled_water has a water activity of exactly one. As
temperature increases, aw typically increases, except in some products with
crystalline salt or sugar.
Higher aw substances tend to support more microorganisms. Bacteria usually
require at least 0.91, and fungi at least 0.7.[1] See also fermentation.
Water migrates from areas of high aw to areas of low aw. For example, if honey
(aw â 0.6) is exposed to humid air (aw â 0.7), the honey absorbs_water_from
the_air. If salami (aw â 0.87) is exposed to dry air (aw â 0.5), the salami
dries_out, which could preserve it or spoil it.

***** Formulae[edit] *****
Definition of aw:
          a  w   &#x2261; p  /  p &#x2217;   {\displaystyle a_{w}\equiv p/p*}
      [{\displaystyle a_{w}\equiv p/p*}]
where p is the partial vapor pressure of water in the solution, and p* is the
partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.
Alternate definition:
          a  w   &#x2261;  l  w    x  w     {\displaystyle a_{w}\equiv l_{w}x_
      {w}}  [a_{w}\equiv l_{w}x_{w}]
where lw is the activity_coefficient of water and xw is the mole fraction of
water in the aqueous fraction.
Relationship to relative_humidity: The relative humidity of air in equilibrium
with a sample is called the Equilibrium Relative Humidity (ERH).[2]
          E R H  =  a  w   &#x00D7; 100 &#x0025;   {\displaystyle \mathrm {ERH}
      =a_{w}\times 100\%}  [{\mathrm  {ERH}}=a_{w}\times 100\%]
Estimated mold-free shelf life in days at 21Â° C:
          M F S L  =  10  7.91 &#x2212; 8.1  a  w       {\displaystyle \mathrm
      {MFSL} =10^{7.91-8.1a_{w}}}  [{\mathrm  {MFSL}}=10^{{7.91-8.1a_{w}}}][3]
***** Uses[edit] *****
Water activity is an important consideration for food product design and food
safety.
**** Food product design[edit] ****
Food designers use water activity to formulate shelf-stable_food. If a product
is kept below a certain water activity, then mold growth is inhibited. This
results in a longer shelf_life.
Water activity values can also help limit moisture_migration within a food
product made with different ingredients. If raisins of a higher water activity
are packaged with bran flakes of a lower water activity, the water from the
raisins migrates to the bran flakes over time, making the raisins hard and the
bran flakes soggy. Food formulators use water activity to predict how much
moisture migration affects their product.
**** Food safety[edit] ****
Water activity is used in many cases as a critical_control_point for Hazard
Analysis_and_Critical_Control_Points (HACCP) programs. Samples of the food
product are periodically taken from the production area and tested to ensure
water activity values are within a specified range for food quality and safety.
Measurements can be made in as little as five minutes, and are made regularly
in most major food production facilities.
For many years, researchers tried to equate bacterial growth potential with
water_content. They found that the values were not universal, but specific to
each food product. W. J. Scott first established that bacterial_growth
correlated with water activity, not water content, in 1953. It is firmly
established that growth of bacteria is inhibited at specific water activity
values. U.S. Food_and_Drug_Administration (FDA) regulations for intermediate
moisture_foods are based on these values.
Lowering the water activity of a food product should not be seen as a kill
step. Studies in powdered_milk show that viable cells can exist at much lower
water activity values, but that they never grow.[citation_needed] Over time,
bacterial levels decline.
***** Measurement[edit] *****
Water activity values are obtained by either a resistive electrolytic, a
capacitance or a dew_point hygrometer.
**** Resistive electrolytic hygrometers[edit] ****
Resistive electrolytic hygrometers use a sensing element in the form of a
liquid electrolyte held in between of two small glass rods by capillary force.
The electrolyte changes resistance if it absorbs or loses water vapor. The
resistance is directly proportional to relative air humidity, and also to water
activity of the sample (once vaporâliquid_equilibrium is established). This
relation can be checked by either a verification or calibration using salt-
water mixtures, which provide a well-defined and reproducible air humidity in
the measurement chamber.
The sensor does not have any physically given hysteresis as it is known from
capacitance hygrometers and sensors, and does not require regular cleaning as
its surface is not the effectively sensing element. Volatiles, in principle,
influence the measurement performanceâespecially those that dissociate in the
electrolyte and thereby change its resistance. Such influences can easily be
avoided by using chemical protection filters that absorb the volatile compound
before arriving at the sensor.
**** Capacitance hygrometers[edit] ****
Capacitance hygrometers consist of two charged plates separated by a polymer
membrane dielectric. As the membrane adsorbs water, its ability to hold a
charge increases and the capacitance is measured. This value is roughly
proportional to the water activity as determined by a sensor-specific
calibration.
Capacitance hygrometers are not affected by most volatile chemicals and can be
much smaller than other alternative sensors. They do not require cleaning, but
are less accurate than dew point hygrometers (+/- 0.015 aw). They should have
regular calibration checks and can be affected by residual water in the polymer
membrane (hysteresis).
**** Dew point hygrometers[edit] ****
Red line shows saturation
The temperature at which dew forms on a clean surface is directly related to
the vapor_pressure of the air. Dew point hygrometers work by placing a mirror
over a closed sample chamber. The mirror is cooled until the dew point
temperature is measured by means of an optical_sensor. This temperature is then
used to find the relative_humidity of the chamber using psychrometrics charts.
This method is theoretically the most accurate (+/- 0.003 aw) and often the
fastest. The sensor requires cleaning if debris accumulates on the mirror.
**** Equilibration[edit] ****
With either method, vaporâliquid_equilibrium must occur in the sample
chamber. This takes place over time or can be aided by the addition of a fan in
the chamber. Thermal_equilibrium must also take place unless the sample
temperature is measured.
***** Moisture content[edit] *****
Water activity is related to water_content in a non-linear_relationship known
as a moisture_sorption_isotherm curve. These isotherms are substance- and
temperature-specific. Isotherms can be used to help predict product stability
over time in different storage conditions.
***** Use in humidity control[edit] *****
There is net evaporation from a solution with a water activity greater than the
relative humidity of its surroundings. There is net absorption of water by a
solution with a water activity less than the relative humidity of its
surroundings. Therefore, in an enclosed space, a solution can be used to
regulate humidity.[4]
