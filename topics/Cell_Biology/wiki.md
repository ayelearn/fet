Cell biology (also called cytology, from the Greek ÎºÏÏÎ¿Ï, kytos, "vessel")
is a branch of biology that studies the structure and function of the cell,
which is the basic unit of life.[1] Cell biology is concerned with the
physiological properties, metabolic processes, signaling_pathways, life_cycle,
chemical_composition and interactions of the cell with their environment. This
is done both on a microscopic and molecular level as it encompasses prokaryotic
cells and eukaryotic_cells. Knowing the components of cells and how cells work
is fundamental to all biological_sciences; it is also essential for research in
bio-medical fields such as cancer, and other diseases. Research in cell biology
is closely related to genetics, biochemistry, molecular_biology, immunology and
cytochemistry.[2]

***** History[edit] *****
Cells, which were once invisible to the naked eye, were first seen in 17th
century Europe with the invention of the compound_microscope. Robert_Hooke was
the first person to term the building block of all living organisms as "cells"
after looking at cork.[3] The cell theory states that all living things are
made up of cells.[4] The theory also states that both plants and animals are
composed of cells which was confirmed by plant scientist, Matthias_Schleiden
and animal scientist, Theodor_Schwann in 1839.[4] 19 years later, Rudolf
Virchow contributed to the cell theory, arguing that all cells come from the
division of preexisting cells.[4] In recent years, there have been many studies
which question the cell theory. Scientists have struggled to decide whether
viruses are alive or not. Viruses lack common characteristics of a living cell,
such as membranes, cell organelles, and the ability to reproduce by themselves.
[5] Viruses range from 0.005 to 0.03 micrometers in size whereas bacteria range
from 1-5 micrometers.[6] Modern day cell biology research looks at different
ways to culture and manipulate cells outside of a living body to further
research in human anatomy and physiology, to derive treatments and other
medications, etc. The techniques by which cells are studied have evolved.
Advancement in microscopic techniques and technology such as fluorescence
microscopy, phase-contrast_microscopy, dark_field_microscopy, confocal
microscopy, cytometry, transmission_electron_microscopy, etc. have allowed
scientists to get a better idea of the structure of cells.[7]
***** Cell structure[edit] *****
There are two fundamental classifications of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
The major difference between the two is the presence or absence of organelles.
Other factors such as size, the way in which they reproduce, and the number of
cells distinguish them from one another.[8] Eukaryotic cells include animal,
plant, fungi, and protozoa cells which all have a nucleus enclosed by a
membrane, with various shapes and sizes.[9] Prokaryotic cells, lacking an
enclosed nucleus, include bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotic cells are much
smaller than eukaryotic cells, making prokaryotic cells the smallest form of
life.[10] Cytologists typically focus on eukaryotic cells whereas prokaryotic
cells are the focus of microbiologists, but this is not always the case.
***** Internal cellular structures[edit] *****
The generalized structure and molecular components of a cell
**** Chemical and molecular environment[edit] ****
The study of the cell is done on a molecular level; however, most of the
processes within the cell are made up of a mixture of small organic molecules,
inorganic ions, hormones, and water. Approximately 75-85% of the cell's volume
is due to water making it an indispensable solvent as a result of its polarity
and structure.[11] These molecules within the cell, which operate as
substrates, provide a suitable environment for the cell to carry out metabolic
reactions and signalling. The cell shape varies among the different types of
organisms, and are thus then classified into two categories: eukaryotes and
prokaryotes. In the case of eukaryotic cells - which are made up of animal,
plant, fungi, and protozoa cells - the shapes are generally round and spherical
or oval[9] while for prokaryotic cells â which are composed of bacteria and
archaea - the shapes are: spherical (cocci), rods (bacillus), curved (vibrio),
and spirals (spirochetes).[12]
Cell biology focuses more on the study of eukaryotic cells, and their
signalling pathways, rather than on prokaryotes which is covered under
microbiology. The main constituents of the general molecular composition of the
cell includes: proteins and lipids which are either free flowing or membrane
bound, along with different internal compartments known as organelles. This
environment of the cell is made up of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions which
allows for the exchange of the above-mentioned molecules and ions. The
hydrophilic regions of the cell are mainly on the inside and outside of the
cell, while the hydrophobic regions are within the phospholipid_bilayer of the
cell membrane. The cell membrane consists of lipids and proteins which accounts
for its hydrophobicity as a result of being non-polar substances.[11]
Therefore, in order for these molecules to participate in reactions, within the
cell, they need to be able to cross this membrane layer to get into the cell.
They accomplish this process of gaining access to the cell via: osmotic
pressure, diffusion, concentration gradients, and membrane channels. Inside of
the cell are extensive internal sub-cellular membrane-bounded compartments
called organelles.
**** Organelles[edit] ****
Cells contain specialized sub-cellular compartments including cell_membrane,
cytoplasm, mitochondria, and ribosomes. See organelle.
***** Processes[edit] *****
**** Growth and development[edit] ****
The growth process of the cell does not refer to the size of the cell, but the
density of the number of cells present in the organism at a given time. Cell
growth pertains to the increase in the number of cells present in an organism
as it grows and develops; as the organism gets larger so too does the number of
cells present. Cells are the foundation of all organisms, they are the
fundamental unit of life. The growth and development of the cell are essential
for the maintenance of the host, and survival of the organisms. For this
process the cell goes through the steps of the cell_cycle and development which
involves cell growth, DNA_replication, cell_division, regeneration, and cell
death. The cell cycle is divided into four distinct phases: G1, S, G2, and M.
The G phase â which is the cell growth phase â makes up approximately 95%
of the cycle.[13] The proliferation of cells is instigated by progenitors; the
cells then differentiate to become ,[clarification_needed] where cells of the
same type aggregate to form tissues, then organs and ultimately systems.[11]
The G phases along with the S phase â DNA replication, damage and repair â
are considered to be the inter-phase portion of the cycle, while the M phase
(mitosis and [[]])[clarification_needed] is the cell division portion of the
cycle.[13] The cell cycle is regulated by a series of signalling factors and
complexes such as cyclin-dependent_kinase and p53, to name a few. When the cell
has completed its growth process, and if it is found to be damaged or altered,
it undergoes cell death, either by apoptosis or necrosis, in order to eliminate
the threat it can cause to the organism's survival.
    * Active_transport and Passive_transport â Movement of molecules into and
      out of cells
    * Autophagy â The process whereby cells "eat" their own internal
      components or microbial invaders
    * Adhesion â Holding together cells and tissues.
    * Cell movement â Chemotaxis, contraction, cilia and flagella
    * Cell_signaling â Regulation of cell behavior by signals from outside
**** Other cellular processes[edit] ****
    * Division - By which cells reproduce either by mitosis (to produce clones
      of the parent cell) or Meiosis (to produce haploid gametes)
    * DNA_repair - Cell_death and cell senescence.
    * Metabolism - Glycolysis, respiration, photosynthesis, and chemosynthesis.
    * Signalling - The process by which the activities in the cell are
      regulated.
    * Transcription and mRNA_splicing - Gene expression.
