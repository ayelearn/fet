***** Eastern boundary currents[edit] *****
Eastern boundary currents are relatively shallow, broad and slow-flowing. They
are found on the eastern side of oceanic_basins (adjacent to the western coasts
of continents). Subtropical eastern boundary currents flow equatorward,
transporting cold water from higher latitudes to lower latitudes; examples
include the Benguela_Current, the Canary_Current, the Humboldt_Current, and the
California_Current. Coastal_upwelling often brings nutrient-rich water into
eastern boundary current regions, making them productive areas of the ocean.
***** Western boundary currents[edit] *****
The world's largest ocean gyres
Western boundary currents are warm, deep, narrow, and fast flowing currents
that form on the west side of ocean basins due to western intensification. They
carry warm water from the tropics poleward. Examples include the Gulf_Stream,
the Agulhas_Current, and the Kuroshio.
**** Western intensification[edit] ****
Western intensification is the intensification of the western arm of an oceanic
current, particularly a large gyre in an ocean_basin. The trade_winds blow
westward in the tropics, and the westerlies blow eastward at mid-latitudes.
This wind pattern applies a stress to the subtropical ocean surface with
negative curl in the northern hemisphere and a positive curl in the southern
hemisphere. The resulting Sverdrup_transport is equatorward in both cases.
Because of conservation of mass and potential_vorticity conservation, that
transport is balanced by a narrow, intense poleward current, which flows along
the western boundary of the ocean basin, allowing the vorticity introduced by
coastal friction to balance the vorticity input of the wind. Western
intensification also occurs in the polar gyres, where the sign of the wind
stress curl and the direction of the resulting currents are reversed. It is
because of western intensification that the currents on the western boundary of
a basin (such as the Gulf_Stream, a current on the western side of the Atlantic
Ocean) are stronger than those on the eastern boundary (such as the California
Current, on the eastern side of the Pacific_Ocean). Western intensification was
first explained by the American oceanographer Henry_Stommel.
In 1948, Henry Stommel published a paper in Transactions,_American_Geophysical
Union titled "The Westward Intensification of Wind-Driven Ocean Currents",[1]
in which he used a simple, homogeneous, rectangular ocean model to examine the
streamlines and surface height contours for an ocean at a non-rotating frame,
an ocean characterized by a constant Coriolis parameter and finally, a real-
case ocean basin with a latitudinally-varying Coriolis parameter. In this
simple, modeling setting, the principal factors that were accounted for
influencing the oceanic circulation were surface wind stress, bottom friction,
a variable surface height leading to horizontal pressure gradients, and
finally, the Coriolis_effect.
In his simplified model,[2] he assumed an ocean of constant density and depth
D + h   {\displaystyle D+h}  [D+h] in the presence of ocean currents; he also
introduced a linearized, frictional term to account for the dissipative effects
that prevent the real ocean from accelerating. He starts, thus, from the
steady-state momentum and continuity equations:
   f ( D + h ) v &#x2212; F cos &#x2061;  (    &#x03C0; y  b   )  &#x2212; R u
&#x2212; g ( D + h )    &#x2202; h   &#x2202; x    = 0  ( 1 )   {\displaystyle
f(D+h)v-F\cos \left({\frac {\pi y}{b}}\right)-Ru-g(D+h){\frac {\partial h}
{\partial x}}=0\qquad (1)}  [f(D+h)v-F\cos \left({\frac  {\pi y}{b}}\right)-Ru-
g(D+h){\frac  {\partial h}{\partial x}}=0\qquad (1)]
    &#x2212; f ( D + h ) u &#x2212; R v &#x2212; g ( D + h )    &#x2202; h
&#x2202; y    = 0   ( 2 )   {\displaystyle \quad -f(D+h)u-Rv-g(D+h){\frac
{\partial h}{\partial y}}=0\qquad \qquad (2)}  [\quad -f(D+h)u-Rv-g(D+h){\frac
{\partial h}{\partial y}}=0\qquad \qquad (2)]
        &#x2202; [ ( D + h ) u ]   &#x2202; x    +    &#x2202; [ ( D + h ) v ]
&#x2202; y    = 0    ( 3 )   {\displaystyle \qquad \qquad {\frac {\partial [
(D+h)u]}{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial [(D+h)v]}{\partial y}}=0\qquad \qquad
\qquad (3)}  [\qquad \qquad {\frac  {\partial [(D+h)u]}{\partial x}}+{\frac
{\partial [(D+h)v]}{\partial y}}=0\qquad \qquad \qquad (3)]
Here     f   {\displaystyle f}  [f] is the strength of the Coriolis force,
R   {\displaystyle R}  [R] is the bottom-friction coeffecient,     g
{\displaystyle g\,\,}  [g\,\,] is gravity, and     &#x2212; F cos &#x2061;
(    &#x03C0; y  b   )    {\displaystyle -F\cos \left({\frac {\pi y}
{b}}\right)}  [-F\cos \left({\frac  {\pi y}{b}}\right)] is the wind forcing.
The wind is blowing towards the west at     y = 0   {\displaystyle y=0}  [y=0]
and towards the east at     y = b   {\displaystyle y=b}  [y=b].

Acting on (1) with       &#x2202;  &#x2202; y      {\displaystyle {\frac
{\partial }{\partial y}}}  [{\frac  {\partial }{\partial y}}] and on (2) with
&#x2202;  &#x2202; x      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}}  [
{\frac  {\partial }{\partial x}}], subtracting, and then using (3), gives
         v ( D + h )  (    &#x2202; f   &#x2202; y    )  +    &#x03C0; F  b
      sin &#x2061;  (    &#x03C0; y  b   )  + R  (     &#x2202; v   &#x2202; x
      &#x2212;    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; y     )  = 0  ( 4 )   {\displaystyle v
      (D+h)\left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}\right)+{\frac {\pi F}{b}}\sin

      {\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}\right)=0\quad (4)}  [v(D+h)\left({\frac

If we introduce a Stream_function     &#x03C8;   {\displaystyle \psi }  [\psi ]

equation (4) reduces to
    &#x2207;  2   &#x03C8; + &#x03B1;  (    &#x2202; &#x03C8;   &#x2202; x    )

and
   &#x03B3; =    &#x03C0; F   R b      {\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {\pi F}
{Rb}}}  [\gamma ={\frac  {\pi F}{Rb}}]
The solutions of (5) with boundary condition that     &#x03C8;   {\displaystyle
\psi }  [\psi ] be constant on the coastlines, and for different values of
&#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ], emphasize the role of the
variation of the Coriolis parameter with latitude in inciting the strengthening
of western boundary currents. Such currents are observed to be much faster,
deeper, narrower and warmer than their eastern counterparts.
For a non-rotating state (zero Coriolis parameter) as well as an ocean state at
which the Coriolis parameter is a constant, the ocean circulation does not
demonstrate any preference toward intensification/acceleration near the western
boundary. The streamlines exhibit a symmetric behavior in all directions, with
the height contours demonstrating a nearly parallel relation to the
streamlines, in the case of the homogeneously rotating ocean. Finally, for the
case of interest - the one in which the Coriolis_force is latitudinally variant
- a distinct tendency for an asymmetrical streamline diagram is noted, with an
observed, intense clustering toward the western part of the modeled ocean. A
nice set of figures depicting the distribution of streamlines and height
contours for the cases of a uniformly-rotating ocean and an ocean where the
Coriolis force is linearly dependent on latitude can be found in Stommel's 1948
paper.
**** Sverdrup Balance and Physics of Western Intensification[edit] ****
The physics of western intensification can be understood through a mechanism
that helps maintain the vortex balance along an ocean gyre. Harald_Sverdrup was
the first one, preceding Henry_Stommel, to attempt to explain the mid-ocean
vorticity balance by looking at the relationship between surface wind forcings
and the mass transport within the upper ocean layer. He assumed a geostrophic
interior flow, while neglecting any frictional or viscosity effects and
presuming that the circulation vanishes at some depth in the ocean. This
prohibited the application of his theory to the western boundary currents,
since some form of dissipative effect (bottom Ekman layer) would be later shown
to be necessary to predict a closed circulation for an entire ocean basin and
to counteract the wind-driven flow.
Sverdrup introduced a potential vorticity argument to connect the net, interior
flow of the oceans to the surface wind stress and the incited planetary
vorticity perturbations. For instance, Ekman convergence in the sub-tropics
(related to the existence of the trade winds in the tropics and the westerlies
in the mid-latitudes) was suggested to lead to a downward vertical velocity and
therefore, a squashing of the water columns, which subsequently forces the
ocean gyre to spin more slowly (via angular momentum conservation). This is
accomplished via a decrease in planetary vorticity (since relative vorticity
variations are not significant in large ocean circulations), a phenomenon
attainable through an equator-wardly directed, interior flow that characterizes
the subtropical gyre.[3] The opposite is applicable when Ekman divergence is
induced, leading to Ekman absorption (suction) and a subsequent, water column
stretching and poleward return flow, a characteristic of sub-polar gyres.
This return flow, as shown by Stommel,[1] occurs in a meridional current,
concentrated near the western boundary of an ocean basin. To balance the
vorticity source induced by the wind stress forcing, Stommel introduced a
linear frictional term in the Sverdrup equation, functioning as the vorticity
sink. This bottom ocean, frictional drag on the horizontal flow allowed Stommel
to theoretically predict a closed, basin-wide circulation, while demonstrating
the west-ward intensification of wind-driven gyres and its attribution to the
Coriolis variation with latitude (beta effect). Walter_Munk (1950) further
implemented Stommel's theory of western intensification by using a more
realistic frictional term, while emphasizing "the lateral dissipation of eddy
energy."[4] In this way, not only did he reproduce Stommel's results,
recreating thus the circulation of a western boundary current of an ocean gyre
resembling the Gulf stream, but he also showed that sub-polar gyres should
develop northward of the subtropical ones, spinning in the opposite direction.
