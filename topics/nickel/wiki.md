Nickel is a chemical_element with the symbol Ni and atomic_number 28. It is a
silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the
transition_metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize
the reactive surface_area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger
pieces are slow to react with air under standard_conditions because an oxide
layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even
so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually
in ultramafic_rocks,[6][7] and in the interiors of larger nickelÃ¢Â€Â“iron
meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.
Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin
of those elements as major end products of supernova_nucleosynthesis. An
ironÃ¢Â€Â“nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's_outer and inner_cores.[8]
Use of nickel (as a natural meteoric nickelÃ¢Â€Â“iron alloy) has been traced as
far back as 3500Â BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical
element in 1751 by Axel_Fredrik_Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a
copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los,_HÃƒÂ¤lsingland,_Sweden. The element's
name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar
to Old_Nick), who personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted
refinement into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron
ore limonite, which often contains 1Ã¢Â€Â“2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore
minerals include pentlandite and a mixture of Ni-rich natural silicates known
as garnierite. Major production sites include the Sudbury_region in Canada
(which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New_Caledonia in the Pacific, and
Norilsk in Russia.
Nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered
corrosion-resistant. Historically, it has been used for plating iron and brass,
coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a
high silvery polish, such as German_silver. About 9% of world nickel production
is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects
sometimes provoke nickel_allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though
its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent
years.
Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium)[9]
that are ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent
magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based
permanent magnets and rare-earth_magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times
chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A
further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy
steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including
the fast-growing battery sector.[10] As a compound, nickel has a number of
niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst_for_hydrogenation,
cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments.[11] Nickel is an
essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with
nickel as an active_site.

Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high
polish. It is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room
temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie
temperature is 355Â Ã‚Â°C (671Â Ã‚Â°F), meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic
above this temperature.[13] The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered_cube
with the lattice parameter of 0.352Â nm, giving an atomic_radius of 0.124Â nm.
This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70Â GPa. Nickel
belongs to the transition metals. It is hard, malleable and ductile, and has a
relatively high for transition metals electrical and thermal_conductivity.[14]
The high compressive_strength of 34 GPa, predicted for ideal crystals, is never
obtained in the real bulk material due to the formation and movement of
dislocations; however, it has been reached in Ni nanoparticles.[15]
*** Electron configuration dispute ***
The nickel atom has two electron_configurations, [Ar] 3d8 4s2 and [Ar] 3d9 4s1,
which are very close in energy Ã¢Â€Â“ the symbol [Ar] refers to the argon-like
core structure. There is some disagreement on which configuration has the
lowest energy.[16] Chemistry textbooks quote the electron configuration of
nickel as [Ar] 4s2 3d8,[17] which can also be written [Ar] 3d8 4s2.[18] This
configuration agrees with the Madelung_energy_ordering_rule, which predicts
that 4s is filled before 3d. It is supported by the experimental fact that the
lowest energy state of the nickel atom is a 3d8 4s2 energy level, specifically
the 3d8(3F) 4s2 3F, JÂ =Â 4 level.[19]
However, each of these two configurations splits into several energy levels due
to fine_structure,[19] and the two sets of energy levels overlap. The average
energy of states with configuration [Ar] 3d9 4s1 is actually lower than the
average energy of states with configuration [Ar] 3d8 4s2. For this reason, the
research literature on atomic calculations quotes the ground state
configuration of nickel as [Ar] 3d9 4s1.[16]
**** Isotopes ****
Main article: Isotopes_of_nickel
The isotopes of nickel range in atomic_weight from 48Â u (48
Ni) to 78Â u (78
Ni).
Naturally occurring nickel is composed of five stable isotopes; 58
Ni, 60
Ni, 61
Ni, 62
Ni and 64
Ni, with 58
Ni being the most abundant (68.077% natural_abundance). Isotopes heavier than
62
Ni cannot be formed by nuclear_fusion without losing energy.
Nickel-62 has the highest mean nuclear_binding_energy per nucleon of any
nuclide, at 8.7946Â MeV/nucleon.[20] Its binding energy is greater than both
56
Fe
 and
58
Fe
, more abundant elements often incorrectly cited as having the most tightly-
bound nuclides.[21] Although this would seem to predict nickel-62 as the most
abundant heavy element in the universe, the relatively high rate of
photodisintegration of nickel in stellar interiors causes iron to be by far the
most abundant.[21]
Stable isotope nickel-60 is the daughter product of the extinct_radionuclide
60
Fe
, which decays with a half-life of 2.6 million years. Because 60
Fe has such a long half-life, its persistence in materials in the solar_system
may generate observable variations in the isotopic composition of 60
Ni. Therefore, the abundance of 60
Ni present in extraterrestrial material may provide insight into the origin of
the solar system and its early history.
Some 18 nickel radioisotopes have been characterised, the most stable being 59
Ni with a half-life of 76,000 years, 63
Ni with 100 years, and 56
Ni with 6 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that
are less than 60 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less
than 30 seconds. This element also has one meta_state.[22]
Radioactive nickel-56 is produced by the silicon_burning_process and later set
free in large quantities during type_Ia supernovae. The shape of the light
curve of these supernovae at intermediate to late-times corresponds to the
decay via electron_capture of nickel-56 to cobalt-56 and ultimately to iron-56.
[23] Nickel-59 is a long-lived cosmogenic radionuclide with a half-life of
76,000 years. 59
Ni has found many applications in isotope_geology. 59
Ni has been used to date the terrestrial age of meteorites and to determine
abundances of extraterrestrial dust in ice and sediment. Nickel-78's half-life
was recently measured at 110 milliseconds, and is believed an important isotope
in supernova_nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron.[24] The nuclide
48Ni, discovered in 1999, is the most proton-rich heavy element isotope known.
With 28 protons and 20 neutrons 48Ni is "double_magic", as is 78
Ni with 28 protons and 50 neutrons. Both are therefore unusually stable for
nuclides with so large a proton-neutron imbalance.[22][25]
**** Occurrence ****

taenite, in an octahedrite meteorite
On Earth, nickel occurs most often in combination with sulfur and iron in
pentlandite, with sulfur in millerite, with arsenic in the mineral nickeline,
and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel galena.[26] Nickel is commonly found in
iron_meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite.
The bulk of the nickel is mined from two types of ore deposits. The first is
laterite, where the principal ore mineral mixtures are nickeliferous limonite,
(Fe,Ni)O(OH), and garnierite (a mixture of various hydrous nickel and nickel-
rich silicates). The second is magmatic sulfide deposits, where the principal
ore mineral is pentlandite: (Ni,Fe)
9S
8.
Australia and New_Caledonia have the biggest estimate reserves, at 45% of
world's total.[27]
Identified land-based resources throughout the world averaging 1% nickel or
greater comprise at least 130 million tons of nickel (about the double of known
reserves). About 60% is in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits.[27]
On geophysical evidence, most of the nickel on Earth is believed to be in the
Earth's outer and inner_cores. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring
alloys of iron and nickel. For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion
of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) may be
present, while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite
and taenite are also found in nickel_iron_meteorites.[28]

Tetracarbonyl nickel
The most common oxidation_state of nickel is +2, but compounds of Ni0, Ni+, and
Ni3+ are well known, and the exotic oxidation states Ni2Ã¢ÂˆÂ’, Ni1Ã¢ÂˆÂ’, and Ni4+
have been produced and studied.[29]
**** Nickel(0) ****
Nickel_tetracarbonyl (Ni(CO)
4), discovered by Ludwig_Mond,[30] is a volatile, highly toxic liquid at room
temperature. On heating, the complex decomposes back to nickel and carbon
monoxide:
      Ni(CO)
      4 Ã¢Â‡ÂŒ Ni + 4 CO
This behavior is exploited in the Mond_process for purifying nickel, as
described above. The related nickel(0) complex bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) is
a useful catalyst in organonickel_chemistry because the cyclooctadiene (or cod)
ligands are easily displaced.
**** Nickel(I) ****
Nickel(I) complexes are uncommon, but one example is the tetrahedral complex
NiBr(PPh3)3. Many nickel(I) complexes feature Ni-Ni bonding, such as the dark
red diamagnetic K
4[Ni
2(CN)
6] prepared by reduction of K
2[Ni
2(CN)
6] with sodium_amalgam. This compound is oxidised in water, liberating H
2.[31]
It is thought that the nickel(I) oxidation state is important to nickel-
containing enzymes, such as [NiFe]-hydrogenase, which catalyzes the reversible
reduction of protons to H
2.[32]

Crystals of hydrated nickel_sulfate.
Nickel(II) forms compounds with all common anions, including sulfide, sulfate,
carbonate, hydroxide, carboxylates, and halides. Nickel(II)_sulfate is produced
in large quantities by dissolving nickel metal or oxides in sulfuric acid,
forming both a hexa- and heptahydrates[33] useful for electroplating nickel.
Common salts of nickel, such as the chloride, nitrate, and sulfate, dissolve in
water to give green solutions of the metal_aquo_complex [Ni(H
2O)
6]2+
.
The four halides form nickel compounds, which are solids with molecules that
feature octahedral Ni centres. Nickel(II)_chloride is most common, and its
behavior is illustrative of the other halides. Nickel(II) chloride is produced
by dissolving nickel or its oxide in hydrochloric_acid. It is usually
encountered as the green hexahydrate, the formula of which is usually written
NiCl2Ã¢Â€Â¢6H2O. When dissolved in water, this salt forms the metal_aquo_complex

. Dehydration of NiCl2Ã¢Â€Â¢6H2O gives the yellow anhydrous NiCl
2.
Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) complexes, e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel
chloride, exist both in tetrahedral and square planar geometries. The
tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic, whereas the square planar complexes are
diamagnetic. In having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of
octahedral complexes, they contrast with the divalent complexes of the heavier
group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which form only square-planar
geometry.[29]
Nickelocene is known; it has an electron_count of 20, making it relatively
unstable.
Nickel(III) antimonide
**** Nickel(III) and (IV) ****
Numerous Ni(III) compounds are known, with the first such examples being Nickel
(III) trihalophosphines (NiIII(PPh3)X3).[34] Further, Ni(III) forms simple
salts with fluoride[35] or oxide ions. Ni(III) can be stabilized by ÃÂƒ-donor
ligands such as thiols and phosphines.[31]
Ni(IV) is present in the mixed oxide BaNiO
3, while Ni(III) is present in nickel_oxide_hydroxide, which is used as the
cathode in many rechargeable_batteries, including nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron,
nickel_hydrogen, and nickel-metal_hydride, and used by certain manufacturers in
Li-ion batteries.[36] Ni(IV) remains a rare oxidation state of nickel and very
few compounds are known to date.[37][38][39][40]
***** History *****
Because the ores of nickel are easily mistaken for ores of silver,
understanding of this metal and its use dates to relatively recent times.
However, the unintentional use of nickel is ancient, and can be traced back as
far as 3500 BCE. Bronzes from what is now Syria have been found to contain as
much as 2% nickel.[41] Some ancient Chinese manuscripts suggest that "white
copper" (cupronickel, known as baitong) was used there between 1700 and 1400
BCE. This Paktong white copper was exported to Britain as early as the 17th
century, but the nickel content of this alloy was not discovered until 1822.
[42] Coins of nickel-copper alloy were minted by the Bactrian kings Agathocles,
Euthydemus_II and Pantaleon in the 2nd Century BCE, possibly out of the Chinese
cupronickel.[43]
nickeline/niccolite
In medieval Germany, a red mineral was found in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains)
that resembled copper ore. However, when miners were unable to extract any
copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel
(similar to Old_Nick), for besetting the copper. They called this ore
Kupfernickel from the German Kupfer for copper.[44][45][46][47] This ore is now
known to be nickeline, a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel_Fredrik_Cronstedt
tried to extract copper from kupfernickel at a cobalt mine in the Swedish
village of Los, and instead produced a white metal that he named after the
spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel.[48] In modern German,
Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.[14]
Originally, the only source for nickel was the rare Kupfernickel. Beginning in
1824, nickel was obtained as a byproduct of cobalt_blue production. The first
large-scale smelting of nickel began in Norway in 1848 from nickel-rich
pyrrhotite. The introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased
the demand for nickel, and the nickel deposits of New_Caledonia, discovered in
1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery
of the large deposits in the Sudbury_Basin, Canada in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh,
Russia in 1920, and in the Merensky_Reef, South Africa in 1924, made large-
scale production of nickel possible.[42]
***** Coinage *****
Dutch_coins made of pure nickel
Aside from the aforementioned Bactrian coins, nickel was not a component of
coins until the mid-19th century.
**** Canada ****
99.9%_nickel_five-cent_coins were struck in Canada (the world's largest nickel
producer at the time) during non-war years from 1922Ã¢Â€Â“1981; the metal content
made these coins magnetic.[49] During the wartime period 1942Ã¢Â€Â“45, most or all
nickel was removed from Canadian and US coins to save it for manufacturing
armor.[45][50] Canada used 99.9% nickel from 1968 in its higher-value coins
until 2000.
**** Switzerland ****
Coins of nearly pure nickel were first used in 1881 in Switzerland.[51]
**** United Kingdom ****
Birmingham forged nickel coins in about 1833 for trading in Malaya.[52]
**** United States ****
In the United States, the term "nickel" or "nick" originally applied to the
copper-nickel Flying_Eagle_cent, which replaced copper with 12% nickel
1857Ã¢Â€Â“58, then the Indian_Head_cent of the same alloy from 1859Ã¢Â€Â“1864. Still
later, in 1865, the term designated the three-cent_nickel, with nickel
increased to 25%. In 1866, the five-cent_shield_nickel (25% nickel, 75% copper)
appropriated the designation. Along with the alloy proportion, this term has
been used to the present in the United States.
**** Current use ****
In the 21st century, the high price of nickel has led to some replacement of
the metal in coins around the world. Coins still made with nickel alloys
include one- and two-euro_coins, 5Ã‚Â¢, 10Ã‚Â¢, 25Ã‚Â¢ and 50Ã‚Â¢ U.S._coins, and 20p,
50p, Ã‚Â£1 and Ã‚Â£2 UK_coins. Nickel-alloy in 5p and 10p UK coins was replaced
with nickel-plated steel began in 2012, causing allergy problems for some
people and public controversy.[51]
***** World production *****
Time trend of nickel production[53]
Nickel ores grade evolution in some leading nickel producing countries.
More than 2.3 million tonnes (t) of nickel per year are mined worldwide, with
Indonesia (560,000 t), The Philippines (340,000 t), Russia (210,000 t), New
Caledonia (210,000 t), Australia (170,000 t) and Canada (160,000 t) being the
largest producers as of 2019.[27] The largest deposits of nickel in non-Russian
Europe are located in Finland and Greece. Identified land-based resources
averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tonnes of nickel.
Approximately 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition,
extensive deep-sea resources of nickel are in manganese crusts and nodules
covering large areas of the ocean floor, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.[54]
The one locality in the United States where nickel has been profitably mined is
Riddle,_Oregon, where several square miles of nickel-bearing garnierite surface
deposits are located. The mine closed in 1987.[55][56] The Eagle_mine_project
is a new nickel mine in Michigan's upper_peninsula. Construction was completed
in 2013, and operations began in the third quarter of 2014.[57] In the first
full year of operation, Eagle Mine produced 18,000 t.[57]
***** Extraction and purification *****
Evolution of the annual nickel extraction, according to ores.
Nickel is obtained through extractive_metallurgy: it is extracted from the ore
by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater
than 75% purity. In many stainless_steel applications, 75% pure nickel can be
used without further purification, depending on the impurities.
Traditionally, most sulfide ores have been processed using pyrometallurgical
techniques to produce a matte for further refining. Recent advances in
hydrometallurgical_techniques resulted in significantly purer metallic nickel
product. Most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by
concentration through a froth_flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical
extraction. In hydrometallurgical processes, nickel sulfide ores are
concentrated with flotation (differential flotation if Ni/Fe ratio is too low)
and then smelted. The nickel matte is further processed with the Sherritt-
Gordon_process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen_sulfide, leaving a
concentrate of cobalt and nickel. Then, solvent extraction is used to separate
the cobalt and nickel, with the final nickel content greater than 99%.

electrolyte salts visible in the pores.
**** Electrorefining ****
A second common refining process is leaching the metal matte into a nickel salt
solution, followed by the electro-winning of the nickel from solution by
plating it onto a cathode as electrolytic nickel.
**** Mond process ****
Highly purified nickel spheres made by the Mond_process.
Main article: Mond_process
The purest metal is obtained from nickel oxide by the Mond_process, which
achieves a purity of greater than 99.99%.[58] The process was patented by
Ludwig Mond and has been in industrial use since before the beginning of the
20th century. In this process, nickel is reacted with carbon_monoxide in the
presence of a sulfur catalyst at around 40Ã¢Â€Â“80Â Ã‚Â°C to form nickel_carbonyl.
Iron gives iron_pentacarbonyl, too, but this reaction is slow. If necessary,
the nickel may be separated by distillation. Dicobalt_octacarbonyl is also
formed in nickel distillation as a by-product, but it decomposes to tetracobalt
dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non-volatile solid.[59]
Nickel is obtained from nickel carbonyl by one of two processes. It may be
passed through a large chamber at high temperatures in which tens of thousands
of nickel spheres, called pellets, are constantly stirred. The carbonyl
decomposes and deposits pure nickel onto the nickel spheres. In the alternate
process, nickel carbonyl is decomposed in a smaller chamber at 230Â Ã‚Â°C to
create a fine nickel powder. The byproduct carbon monoxide is recirculated and
reused. The highly pure nickel product is known as "carbonyl nickel".[60]
**** Metal value ****
The market price of nickel surged throughout 2006 and the early months of 2007;
as of April 5, 2007, the metal was trading at US$52,300/tonne or $1.47/oz.[61]
The price subsequently fell dramatically, and as of September 2017, the metal
was trading at $11,000/tonne, or $0.31/oz.[62]
The US_nickel_coin contains 0.04 ounces (1.1Â g) of nickel, which at the April
2007 price was worth 6.5 cents, along with 3.75Â grams of copper worth about 3
cents, with a total metal value of more than 9 cents. Since the face value of a
nickel is 5 cents, this made it an attractive target for melting by people
wanting to sell the metals at a profit. However, the United_States_Mint, in
anticipation of this practice, implemented new interim rules on December 14,
2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and
export of cents and nickels.[63] Violators can be punished with a fine of up to
$10,000 and/or imprisoned for a maximum of five years.
As of September 19, 2013, the melt value of a US nickel (copper and nickel
included) is $0.045, which is 90% of the face value.[64]
***** Applications *****
Nickel foam (top) and its internal structure (bottom)
The global production of nickel is presently used as follows: 68% in stainless
steel; 10% in nonferrous alloys; 9% in electroplating; 7% in alloy steel; 3% in
foundries; and 4% other uses (including batteries).[10]
Nickel is used in many specific and recognizable industrial and consumer
products, including stainless_steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable
batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, plating on plumbing
fixtures,[65] and special alloys such as permalloy, elinvar, and invar. It is
used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy
metal, and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons, in which it
typically increases the tensile strength, toughness, and elastic limit. It is
widely used in many other alloys, including nickel brasses and bronzes and
alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold
(Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).[66]
A "horseshoe magnet" made of alnico nickel alloy.
Because it is resistant to corrosion, nickel was occasionally used as a
substitute for decorative silver. Nickel was also occasionally used in some
countries after 1859 as a cheap coinage metal (see above), but in the later
years of the 20th century was replaced by cheaper stainless_steel (i.e., iron)
alloys, except in the United States and Canada.
Nickel is an excellent alloying agent for certain precious metals and is used
in the fire_assay as a collector of platinum_group_elements (PGE). As such,
nickel is capable of fully collecting all six PGE elements from ores, and of
partially collecting gold. High-throughput nickel mines may also engage in PGE
recovery (primarily platinum and palladium); examples are Norilsk in Russia and
the Sudbury Basin in Canada.
Nickel_foam or nickel mesh is used in gas_diffusion_electrodes for alkaline
fuel_cells.[67][68]
Nickel and its alloys are frequently used as catalysts for hydrogenation
reactions. Raney_nickel, a finely divided nickel-aluminium alloy, is one common
form, though related catalysts are also used, including Raney-type catalysts.
Nickel is a naturally magnetostrictive material, meaning that, in the presence
of a magnetic_field, the material undergoes a small change in length.[69][70]
The magnetostriction of nickel is on the order of 50Â ppm and is negative,
indicating that it contracts.
Nickel is used as a binder in the cemented tungsten_carbide or hardmetal
industry and used in proportions of 6% to 12% by weight. Nickel makes the
tungsten carbide magnetic and adds corrosion-resistance to the cemented parts,
although the hardness is less than those with a cobalt binder.[71]
63
Ni, with its half-life of 100.1 years, is useful in krytron devices as a beta
particle (high-speed electron) emitter to make ionization by the keep-alive
electrode more reliable.[72]
Around 27% of all nickel production is destined for engineering, 10% for
building and construction, 14% for tubular products, 20% for metal goods, 14%
for transport, 11% for electronic goods, and 5% for other uses.[10]
***** Biological role *****
Raney_nickel is widely used for hydrogenation of unsaturated oils to make
margarine, and substandard margerine and leftover oil may contain nickel as
contaminant. Forte et al. found that type 2 diabetic patients have 0.89Â ng/ml
of Ni in the blood relative to 0.77Â ng/ml in the control subjects.[73]
Although not recognized until the 1970s, nickel is known to play an important
role in the biology of some plants, eubacteria, archaebacteria, and fungi.[74]
[75][76] Nickel enzymes such as urease are considered virulence factors in some
organisms.[77][78] Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and
carbamate.[75][74] The NiFe_hydrogenases can catalyze the oxidation of H
2 to form protons and electrons, and can also catalyze the reverse reaction,
the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas.[75][74] A nickel-tetrapyrrole
coenzyme, cofactor_F430, is present in methyl coenzyme_M reductase, which can
catalyze the formation of methane, or the reverse reaction, in methanogenic
archaea.[79] One of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an
Fe-Ni-S cluster.[80] Other nickel-bearing enzymes include a rare bacterial
class of superoxide_dismutase[81] and glyoxalase_I enzymes in bacteria and
several parasitic eukaryotic trypanosomal parasites[82] (in higher organisms,
including yeast and mammals, this enzyme contains divalent Zn2+).[83][84][85]
[86][87]
Dietary nickel may affect human health through infections by nickel-dependent
bacteria, but it is also possible that nickel is an essential nutrient for
bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic.
[88] The US Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential
nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended_Dietary_Allowance (RDA) nor an
Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable_Upper_Intake_Level of
dietary nickel is 1000Â Ã‚Âµg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is
estimated at 70 to 100Â Ã‚Âµg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed
is excreted in urine.[89] Relatively large amounts of nickel Ã¢Â€Â“ comparable to
the estimated average ingestion above Ã¢Â€Â“ leach into food cooked in stainless
steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into
one serving of tomato sauce averages 88Â Ã‚Âµg.[90][91]
Nickel released from Siberian_Traps volcanic eruptions is suspected of
assisting the growth of Methanosarcina, a genus of euryarchaeote archaea that
produced methane during the PermianÃ¢Â€Â“Triassic_extinction_event, the biggest
extinction event on record.[92]

The major source of nickel exposure is oral consumption, as nickel is essential
to plants.[94] Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be
increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may
contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-
water; nickelÃ¢Â€Â“steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release
nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and
fossil_fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco_smoke
and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common
form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may
be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.
The average daily exposure does not pose a threat to human health. Most of the
nickel absorbed every day by humans is removed by the kidneys and passed out of
the body through urine or is eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract
without being absorbed. Nickel is not a cumulative poison, but larger doses or
chronic inhalation exposure may be toxic, even carcinogenic, and constitute an
occupational_hazard.[95]
Nickel compounds are classified as human carcinogens[96][97][98][99] based on
increased respiratory cancer risks observed in epidemiological studies of
sulfidic ore refinery workers.[100] This is supported by the positive results
of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice.[101]
[102] The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity
via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel
compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation.[103][104] Nickel metal is
classified as a suspect carcinogen;[96][97][98] there is consistency between
the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly
exposed to metallic nickel[100] and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat
lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder.[105] In the
rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal,
increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia
or fibrosis were observed.[99][101][105][106] In rat studies, oral ingestion of
water-soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant
animals.[107] Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as
epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse
developmental toxicity effects.[108][109][110][111]
People can be exposed to nickel in the workplace by inhalation, ingestion, and
contact with skin or eye. The Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration
(OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible_exposure_limit) for the workplace
at 1Â mg/m3 per 8-hour workday, excluding nickel carbonyl. The National
Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health (NIOSH) specifies the recommended
exposure_limit (REL) of 0.015Â mg/m3 per 8-hour workday. At 10Â mg/m3, nickel is
immediately_dangerous_to_life_and_health.[112] Nickel_carbonyl [Ni(CO)
4] is an extremely toxic gas. The toxicity of metal carbonyls is a function of
both the toxicity of the metal and the off-gassing of carbon_monoxide from the
carbonyl functional groups; nickel carbonyl is also explosive in air.[113][114]
Sensitized individuals may show a skin contact allergy_to_nickel known as a
contact dermatitis. Highly sensitized individuals may also react to foods with
high nickel content.[115] Sensitivity to nickel may also be present in patients
with pompholyx. Nickel is the top confirmed contact allergen worldwide, partly
due to its use in jewelry for pierced_ears.[116] Nickel allergies affecting
pierced ears are often marked by itchy, red skin. Many earrings are now made
without nickel or low-release nickel[117] to address this problem. The amount
allowed in products that contact human skin is now regulated by the European
Union. In 2002, researchers found that the nickel released by 1 and 2 Euro
coins was far in excess of those standards. This is believed to be the result
of a galvanic reaction.[118] Nickel was voted Allergen_of_the_Year in 2008 by
the American Contact Dermatitis Society.[119] In August 2015, the American
Academy of Dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel:
"Estimates suggest that contact dermatitis, which includes nickel
sensitization, accounts for approximately $1.918 billion and affects nearly
72.29 million people."[115]
Reports show that both the nickel-induced activation of hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF-1) and the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes are caused by
depletion of intracellular ascorbate. The addition of ascorbate to the culture
medium increased the intracellular ascorbate level and reversed both the metal-
induced stabilization of HIF-1- and HIF-1ÃÂ±-dependent gene expression.[120]
