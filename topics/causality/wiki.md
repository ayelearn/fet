Causality (also referred to as causation,[1] or cause and effect) is efficacy,
by which one process or state, a cause, contributes to the production of
another process or state, an effect,[2] where the cause is partly responsible
for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause. In general, a
process has many causes,[3] which are also said to be causal factors for it,
and all lie in its past. An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor
for, many other effects, which all lie in its future. Multiple philosophers
have believed that causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time_and
space.[4][5][6]
Causality is an abstraction that indicates how the world progresses,[7] so
basic a concept that it is more apt as an explanation of other concepts of
progression than as something to be explained by others more basic. The concept
is like those of agency and efficacy. For this reason, a leap of intuition may
be needed to grasp it.[8][9] Accordingly, causality is implicit in the logic
and structure of ordinary language.[10]
In the English language, as distinct from Aristotle's own language,
Aristotelian_philosophy uses the word "cause" to mean "explanation" or "answer
to a 'why' question", including Aristotle's material, formal, efficient, and
final "causes"; then the "cause" is the explanans for the explanandum. In this
case, failure to recognize that different kinds of "cause" are being considered
can lead to futile debate. Of Aristotle's_four_explanatory_modes, the one
nearest to the concerns of the present article is the "efficient" one.
The topic of causality remains a staple in contemporary_philosophy.

***** Concept[edit] *****
**** Metaphysics[edit] ****
The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as
metaphysics. Kant thought that time and space were notions prior to human
understanding of the progress or evolution of the world, and he also recognized
the priority of causality. But he did not have the understanding that came with
knowledge of Minkowski_geometry and the special_theory_of_relativity, that the
notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to construct
notions of time and space.[4][5][6]
*** Ontology[edit] ***
A general metaphysical question about cause and effect is what kind of entity
can be a cause, and what kind of entity can be an effect.
One viewpoint on this question is that cause and effect are of one and the same
kind of entity, with causality an asymmetric relation between them. That is to
say, it would make good sense grammatically to say either "A is the cause and B
the effect" or "B is the cause and A the effect", though only one of those two
can be actually true. In this view, one opinion, proposed as a metaphysical
principle in process_philosophy, is that every cause and every effect is
respectively some process, event, becoming, or happening.[11] An example is
'his tripping over the step was the cause, and his breaking his ankle the
effect'. Another view is that causes and effects are 'states of affairs', with
the exact natures of those entities being less restrictively defined than in
process philosophy.[12]
Another viewpoint on the question is the more classical one, that a cause and
its effect can be of different kinds of entity. For example, in Aristotle's
efficient causal explanation, an action can be a cause while an enduring object
is its effect. For example, the generative actions of his parents can be
regarded as the efficient cause, with Socrates being the effect, Socrates being
regarded as an enduring object, in philosophical tradition called a
'substance', as distinct from an action.
*** Epistemology[edit] ***
Since causality is a subtle metaphysical notion, considerable intellectual
effort, along with exhibition of evidence, is needed to establish knowledge of
it in particular empirical circumstances.
*** Geometrical significance[edit] ***
Causality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity.[13][14] These are
topological, and are ingredients for space-time geometry. As developed by
Alfred_Robb, these properties allow the derivation of the notions of time and
space.[15] Max_Jammer writes "the Einstein postulate ... opens the way to a
straightforward construction of the causal topology ... of Minkowski space."
[16] Causal efficacy propagates no faster than light.[17]
Thus, the notion of causality is metaphysically prior to the notions of time
and space. In practical terms, this is because use of the relation of causality
is necessary for the interpretation of empirical experiments. Interpretation of
experiments is needed to establish the physical and geometrical notions of time
and space.
*** Volition[edit] ***
The deterministic world-view holds that the history of the universe can be
exhaustively represented as a progression_of_events following one after as
cause and effect.[14] The incompatibilist version of this holds that there is
no such thing as "free_will". Compatibilism, on the other hand, holds that
determinism is compatible with, or even necessary for, free will.[18]
**** Necessary and sufficient causes[edit] ****
A similar concept occurs in logic, for this see Necessary_and_sufficient
conditions
Causes may sometimes be distinguished into two types: necessary and sufficient.
[19] A third type of causation, which requires neither necessity nor
sufficiency in and of itself, but which contributes to the effect, is called a
"contributory cause."
  Necessary causes
      If x is a necessary cause of y, then the presence of y necessarily
      implies the prior occurrence of x. The presence of x, however, does not
      imply that y will occur.[20]
  Sufficient causes
      If x is a sufficient cause of y, then the presence of x necessarily
      implies the subsequent occurrence of y. However, another cause z may
      alternatively cause y. Thus the presence of y does not imply the prior
      occurrence of x.[20]
  Contributory causes
      For some specific effect, in a singular case, a factor that is a
      contributory cause is one among several co-occurrent causes. It is
      implicit that all of them are contributory. For the specific effect, in
      general, there is no implication that a contributory cause is necessary,
      though it may be so. In general, a factor that is a contributory cause is
      not sufficient, because it is by definition accompanied by other causes,
      which would not count as causes if it were sufficient. For the specific
      effect, a factor that is on some occasions a contributory cause might on
      some other occasions be sufficient, but on those other occasions it would
      not be merely contributory.[21]
J._L._Mackie argues that usual talk of "cause" in fact refers to INUS
conditions (insufficient but non-redundant parts of a condition which is itself
unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect).[22] An example is
a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down. Consider the collection of
events: the short circuit, the proximity of flammable material, and the absence
of firefighters. Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the house's
burning down (since many other collections of events certainly could have led
to the house burning down, for example shooting the house with a flamethrower
in the presence of oxygen and so forth). Within this collection, the short
circuit is an insufficient (since the short circuit by itself would not have
caused the fire) but non-redundant (because the fire would not have happened
without it, everything else being equal) part of a condition which is itself
unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect. So, the short
circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of the house burning down.

Conditional statements are not statements of causality. An important
distinction is that statements of causality require the antecedent to precede
or coincide with the consequent in time, whereas conditional statements do not
require this temporal order. Confusion commonly arises since many different
statements in English may be presented using "If ..., then ..." form (and,
arguably, because this form is far more commonly used to make a statement of
causality). The two types of statements are distinct, however.
For example, all of the following statements are true when interpreting "If
..., then ..." as the material conditional:
   1. If Barack Obama is president of the United States in 2011, then Germany
      is in Europe.
   2. If George Washington is president of the United States in 2011, then
      <arbitrary statement>.
The first is true since both the antecedent and the consequent are true. The
second is true in sentential_logic and indeterminate in natural language,
regardless of the consequent statement that follows, because the antecedent is
false.
The ordinary indicative_conditional has somewhat more structure than the
material conditional. For instance, although the first is the closest, neither
of the preceding two statements seems true as an ordinary indicative reading.
But the sentence:
    * If Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon did not write Macbeth, then someone
      else did.
intuitively seems to be true, even though there is no straightforward causal
relation in this hypothetical situation between Shakespeare's not writing
Macbeth and someone else's actually writing it.
Another sort of conditional, the counterfactual_conditional, has a stronger
connection with causality, yet even counterfactual statements are not all
examples of causality. Consider the following two statements:
   1. If A were a triangle, then A would have three sides.
   2. If switch S were thrown, then bulb B would light.
In the first case, it would not be correct to say that A's being a triangle
caused it to have three sides, since the relationship between triangularity and
three-sidedness is that of definition. The property of having three sides
actually determines A's state as a triangle. Nonetheless, even when interpreted
counterfactually, the first statement is true. An early version of Aristotle's
"four cause" theory is described as recognizing "essential cause". In this
version of the theory, that the closed polygon has three sides is said to be
the "essential cause" of its being a triangle.[23] This use of the word 'cause'
is of course now far obsolete. Nevertheless, it is within the scope of ordinary
language to say that it is essential to a triangle that it has three sides.
A full grasp of the concept of conditionals is important to understanding the
literature on causality. In everyday language, loose conditional statements are
often enough made, and need to be interpreted carefully.
**** Questionable cause[edit] ****
Main article: Questionable_cause
Fallacies of questionable cause, also known as causal fallacies, non-causa pro
causa (Latin for "non-cause for cause"), or false cause, are informal_fallacies
where a cause is incorrectly identified.
***** Theories[edit] *****
Main article: Causal_model
**** Counterfactual theories[edit] ****
Main article: Counterfactual_conditional
Subjunctive conditionals are familiar from ordinary language. They are of the
form, if A were the case, then B would be the case, or if A had been the case,
then B would have been the case. Counterfactual conditionals are specifically
subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents are in fact false, hence the name.
However the term used technically may apply to conditionals with true
antecedents as well.
Psychological research shows that people's thoughts about the causal
relationships between events influences their judgments of the plausibility of
counterfactual alternatives, and conversely, their counterfactual_thinking
about how a situation could have turned out differently changes their judgments
of the causal role of events and agents. Nonetheless, their identification of
the cause of an event, and their counterfactual thought about how the event
could have turned out differently do not always coincide.[24] People
distinguish between various sorts of causes, e.g., strong and weak causes.[25]
Research in the psychology_of_reasoning shows that people make different sorts
of inferences from different sorts of causes, as found in the fields of
cognitive linguistics[26] and accident analysis[27][28] for example.
In the philosophical literature, the suggestion that causation is to be defined
in terms of a counterfactual relation is made by the 18th-century Scottish
philosopher David_Hume. Hume remarks that we may define the relation of cause
and effect such that "where, if the first object had not been, the second never
had existed."[29]
More full-fledged analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual conditionals
only came in the 20th century after development of the possible world semantics
for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals. In his 1973 paper
"Causation," David_Lewis proposed the following definition of the notion of
causal dependence:[30]
      An event E causally depends on C if, and only if, (i) if C had occurred,
      then E would have occurred, and (ii) if C had not occurred, then E would
      not have occurred.
Causation is then defined as a chain of causal dependence. That is, C causes E
if and only if there exists a sequence of events C, D1, D2, ... Dk, E such that
each event in the sequence depends on the previous. The word 'mechanism' may be
used to refer to such a chain.
Note that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal
judgements or how we reason about causation, but rather to give a metaphysical
account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of
events. If correct, the analysis has the power to explain certain features of
causation. Knowing that causation is a matter of counterfactual dependence, we
may reflect on the nature of counterfactual dependence to account for the
nature of causation. For example, in his paper "Counterfactual Dependence and
Time's Arrow," Lewis sought to account for the time-directedness of
counterfactual dependence in terms of the semantics of the counterfactual
conditional.[31] If correct, this theory can serve to explain a fundamental
part of our experience, which is that we can only causally affect the future
but not the past.
**** Probabilistic causation[edit] ****
Main article: Probabilistic_causation
Interpreting causation as a deterministic relation means that if A causes B,
then A must always be followed by B. In this sense, war does not cause deaths,
nor does smoking cause cancer or emphysema. As a result, many turn to a notion
of probabilistic causation. Informally, A ("The person is a smoker")
probabilistically causes B ("The person has now or will have cancer at some
time in the future"), if the information that A occurred increases the
likelihood of Bs occurrence. Formally, P{B|A}â¥ P{B} where P{B|A} is the
conditional probability that B will occur given the information that A
occurred, and P{B}is the probability that B will occur having no knowledge
whether A did or did not occur. This intuitive condition is not adequate as a
definition for probabilistic causation because of its being too general and
thus not meeting our intuitive notion of cause and effect. For example, if A
denotes the event "The person is a smoker," B denotes the event "The person now
has or will have cancer at some time in the future" and C denotes the event
"The person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future," then the
following three relationships hold: P{B|A} â¥ P{B}, P{C|A} â¥ P{C} and P{B|C}
â¥ P{B}. The last relationship states that knowing that the person has
emphysema increases the likelihood that he will have cancer. The reason for
this is that having the information that the person has emphysema increases the
likelihood that the person is a smoker, thus indirectly increasing the
likelihood that the person will have cancer. However, we would not want to
conclude that having emphysema causes cancer. Thus, we need additional
conditions such as temporal relationship of A to B and a rational explanation
as to the mechanism of action. It is hard to quantify this last requirement and
thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions.[citation_needed]
**** Causal calculus[edit] ****
When experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal, the derivation of
cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some
qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause
diseases, usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in causal_graphs such
as Bayesian_networks or path_diagrams. The theory underlying these derivations
relies on the distinction between conditional probabilities, as in     P ( c a
n c e r  |  s m o k i n g )   {\displaystyle P(cancer|smoking)}  [P
(cancer|smoking)], and interventional probabilities, as in     P ( c a n c e r
|  d o ( s m o k i n g ) )   {\displaystyle P(cancer|do(smoking))}  [P
(cancer|do(smoking))]. The former reads: "the probability of finding cancer in
a person known to smoke, having started, unforced by the experimenter, to do so
at an unspecified time in the past", while the latter reads: "the probability
of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a
specified time in the past". The former is a statistical notion that can be
estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter,
while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an
important controlled randomized intervention. It is specifically characteristic
of quantal_phenomena that observations defined by incompatible variables always
involve important intervention by the experimenter, as described quantitatively
by the observer_effect.[vague] In classical thermodynamics, processes are
initiated by interventions called thermodynamic_operations. In other branches
of science, for example astronomy, the experimenter can often observe with
negligible intervention.
The theory of "causal calculus"[32] permits one to infer interventional
probabilities from conditional probabilities in causal Bayesian_networks with
unmeasured variables. One very practical result of this theory is the
characterization of confounding_variables, namely, a sufficient set of
variables that, if adjusted for, would yield the correct causal effect between
variables of interest. It can be shown that a sufficient set for estimating the
causal effect of     X   {\displaystyle X}  [X] on     Y   {\displaystyle Y}
[Y] is any set of non-descendants of     X   {\displaystyle X}  [X] that     d
{\displaystyle d}  [d]-separate     X   {\displaystyle X}  [X] from     Y
{\displaystyle Y}  [Y] after removing all arrows emanating from     X
{\displaystyle X}  [X]. This criterion, called "backdoor", provides a
mathematical definition of "confounding" and helps researchers identify
accessible sets of variables worthy of measurement.
**** Structure learning[edit] ****
While derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph,
parts of the causal structure can, under certain assumptions, be learned from
statistical data. The basic idea goes back to Sewall_Wright's 1921 work[33] on
path_analysis. A "recovery" algorithm was developed by Rebane and Pearl (1987)
[34] which rests on Wright's distinction between the three possible types of
causal substructures allowed in a directed_acyclic_graph (DAG):
   1.    X &#x2192; Y &#x2192; Z   {\displaystyle X\rightarrow Y\rightarrow Z}
      [X\rightarrow Y\rightarrow Z]
   2.    X &#x2190; Y &#x2192; Z   {\displaystyle X\leftarrow Y\rightarrow Z}
      [X\leftarrow Y\rightarrow Z]
   3.    X &#x2192; Y &#x2190; Z   {\displaystyle X\rightarrow Y\leftarrow Z}
      [X\rightarrow Y\leftarrow Z]
Type 1 and type 2 represent the same statistical dependencies (i.e.,     X
{\displaystyle X}  [X] and     Z   {\displaystyle Z}  [Z] are independent given
Y   {\displaystyle Y}  [Y]) and are, therefore, indistinguishable within purely
cross-sectional_data. Type 3, however, can be uniquely identified, since     X
{\displaystyle X}  [X] and     Z   {\displaystyle Z}  [Z] are marginally
independent and all other pairs are dependent. Thus, while the skeletons (the
graphs stripped of arrows) of these three triplets are identical, the
directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable. The same distinction
applies when     X   {\displaystyle X}  [X] and     Z   {\displaystyle Z}  [Z]
have common ancestors, except that one must first condition on those ancestors.
Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the
underlying graph and, then, orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated
by the conditional independencies observed.[32][35][36][37]
Alternative methods of structure learning search through the many possible
causal structures among the variables, and remove ones which are strongly
incompatible with the observed correlations. In general this leaves a set of
possible causal relations, which should then be tested by analyzing time series
data or, preferably, designing appropriately controlled experiments. In
contrast with Bayesian Networks, path_analysis (and its generalization,
structural_equation_modeling), serve better to estimate a known causal effect
or to test a causal model than to generate causal hypotheses.
For nonexperimental data, causal direction can often be inferred if information
about time is available. This is because (according to many, though not all,
theories) causes must precede their effects temporally. This can be determined
by statistical time_series models, for instance, or with a statistical test
based on the idea of Granger_causality, or by direct experimental manipulation.
The use of temporal data can permit statistical tests of a pre-existing theory
of causal direction. For instance, our degree of confidence in the direction
and nature of causality is much greater when supported by cross-correlations,
ARIMA models, or cross-spectral_analysis using vector time series data than by
cross-sectional_data.
**** Derivation theories[edit] ****
Nobel Prize laureate Herbert_A._Simon and philosopher Nicholas_Rescher[38]
claim that the asymmetry of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry
of any mode of implication that contraposes. Rather, a causal relation is not a
relation between values of variables, but a function of one variable (the
cause) on to another (the effect). So, given a system of equations, and a set
of variables appearing in these equations, we can introduce an asymmetric
relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to
our commonsense notion of a causal ordering. The system of equations must have
certain properties, most importantly, if some values are chosen arbitrarily,
the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial
discovery that is perfectly causal. They postulate the inherent serialization
of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical
fields, including physics and economics.
**** Manipulation theories[edit] ****
Some theorists have equated causality with manipulability.[39][40][41][42]
Under these theories, x causes y only in the case that one can change x in
order to change y. This coincides with commonsense notions of causations, since
often we ask causal questions in order to change some feature of the world. For
instance, we are interested in knowing the causes of crime so that we might
find ways of reducing it.
These theories have been criticized on two primary grounds. First, theorists
complain that these accounts are circular. Attempting to reduce causal claims
to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal
interaction. But describing manipulations in non-causal terms has provided a
substantial difficulty.
The second criticism centers around concerns of anthropocentrism. It seems to
many people that causality is some existing relationship in the world that we
can harness for our desires. If causality is identified with our manipulation,
then this intuition is lost. In this sense, it makes humans overly central to
interactions in the world.
Some attempts to defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that don't
claim to reduce causality to manipulation. These accounts use manipulation as a
sign or feature in causation without claiming that manipulation is more
fundamental than causation.[32][43]
**** Process theories[edit] ****
Some theorists are interested in distinguishing between causal processes and
non-causal processes (Russell 1948; Salmon 1984).[44][45] These theorists often
want to distinguish between a process and a pseudo-process. As an example, a
ball moving through the air (a process) is contrasted with the motion of a
shadow (a pseudo-process). The former is causal in nature while the latter is
not.
Salmon (1984)[44] claims that causal processes can be identified by their
ability to transmit an alteration over space and time. An alteration of the
ball (a mark by a pen, perhaps) is carried with it as the ball goes through the
air. On the other hand, an alteration of the shadow (insofar as it is possible)
will not be transmitted by the shadow as it moves along.
These theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is
not causal relationships or causal interactions, but rather identifying causal
processes. The former notions can then be defined in terms of causal processes.

***** Fields[edit] *****
**** Science[edit] ****
For the scientific investigation of efficient causality, the cause and effect
are each best conceived of as temporally transient processes.
Within the conceptual frame of the scientific_method, an investigator sets up
several distinct and contrasting temporally transient material processes that
have the structure of experiments, and records candidate material responses,
normally intending to determine causality in the physical world.[46] For
instance, one may want to know whether a high intake of carrots causes humans
to develop the bubonic_plague. The quantity of carrot intake is a process that
is varied from occasion to occasion. The occurrence or non-occurrence of
subsequent bubonic plague is recorded. To establish causality, the experiment
must fulfill certain criteria, only one example of which is mentioned here. For
example, instances of the hypothesized cause must be set up to occur at a time
when the hypothesized effect is relatively unlikely in the absence of the
hypothesized cause; such unlikelihood is to be established by empirical
evidence. A mere observation of a correlation is not nearly adequate to
establish causality. In nearly all cases, establishment of causality relies on
repetition of experiments and probabilistic reasoning. Hardly ever is causality
established more firmly than as more or less probable. It is most convenient
for establishment of causality if the contrasting material states of affairs
are precisely matched, except for only one variable factor, perhaps measured by
a real number.
*** Physics[edit] ***
Main article: Causality_(physics)
One has to be careful in the use of the word cause in physics. Properly
speaking, the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each
temporally transient processes. For example, force is a useful concept for the
explanation of acceleration, but force is not by itself a cause. More is
needed. For example, a temporally transient process might be characterized by a
definite change of force at a definite time. Such a process can be regarded as
a cause. Causality is not inherently implied in equations_of_motion, but
postulated as an additional constraint that needs to be satisfied (i.e. a cause
always precedes its effect). This constraint has mathematical implications[47]
such as the Kramers-Kronig_relations.
Causality is one of the most fundamental and essential notions of physics.[48]
Causal efficacy cannot 'propagate' faster than light. Otherwise, reference
coordinate systems could be constructed (using the Lorentz_transform of special
relativity) in which an observer would see an effect precede its cause (i.e.
the postulate of causality would be violated).
Causal notions appear in the context of the flow of mass-energy. Any actual
process has causal efficacy that can propagate no faster than light. In
contrast, an abstraction has no causal efficacy. Its mathematical expression
does not propagate in the ordinary sense of the word, though it may refer to
virtual or nominal 'velocities' with magnitudes greater than that of light. For
example, wave packets are mathematical objects that have group_velocity and
phase_velocity. The energy of a wave packet travels at the group velocity
(under normal circumstances); since energy has causal efficacy, the group
velocity cannot be faster than the speed of light. The phase of a wave packet
travels at the phase velocity; since phase is not causal, the phase velocity of
a wave packet can be faster than light.[49]
Causal notions are important in general relativity to the extent that the
existence of an arrow of time demands that the universe's semi-Riemannian
manifold be orientable, so that "future" and "past" are globally definable
quantities.
*** Engineering[edit] ***
A causal_system is a system with output and internal states that depends only
on the current and previous input values. A system that has some dependence on
input values from the future (in addition to possible past or current input
values) is termed an acausal system, and a system that depends solely on future
input values is an anticausal_system. Acausal filters, for example, can only
exist as postprocessing filters, because these filters can extract future
values from a memory buffer or a file.
*** Biology, medicine and epidemiology[edit] ***
Austin_Bradford_Hill built upon the work of Hume and Popper and suggested in
his paper "The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?" that aspects
of an association such as strength, consistency, specificity and temporality be
considered in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations in
the epidemiological situation. (See Bradford-Hill_criteria.) He did not note
however, that temporality is the only necessary criterion among those aspects.
Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used in epidemiology to help
enlighten causal thinking.[50]
*** Psychology[edit] ***
Main article: Causal_reasoning
Psychologists take an empirical approach to causality, investigating how people
and non-human animals detect or infer causation from sensory information, prior
experience and innate_knowledge.
  Attribution
Attribution_theory is the theory concerning how people explain individual
occurrences of causation. Attribution can be external (assigning causality to
an outside agent or forceâclaiming that some outside thing motivated the
event) or internal (assigning causality to factors within the personâtaking
personal responsibility or accountability for one's actions and claiming that
the person was directly responsible for the event). Taking causation one step
further, the type of attribution a person provides influences their future
behavior.
The intention behind the cause or the effect can be covered by the subject of
action. See also accident; blame; intent; and responsibility.
  Causal powers
Whereas David_Hume argued that causes are inferred from non-causal
observations, Immanuel_Kant claimed that people have innate assumptions about
causes. Within psychology, Patricia_Cheng[9] attempted to reconcile the Humean
and Kantian views. According to her power PC theory, people filter observations
of events through an intuition that causes have the power to generate (or
prevent) their effects, thereby inferring specific cause-effect relations.
  Causation and salience
Our view of causation depends on what we consider to be the relevant events.
Another way to view the statement, "Lightning causes thunder" is to see both
lightning and thunder as two perceptions of the same event, viz., an electric
discharge that we perceive first visually and then aurally.
  Naming and causality
David Sobel and Alison Gopnik from the Psychology Department of UC Berkeley
designed a device known as the blicket detector which would turn on when an
object was placed on it. Their research suggests that "even young children will
easily and swiftly learn about a new causal power of an object and
spontaneously use that information in classifying and naming the object."[51]
  Perception of launching events
Some researchers such as Anjan Chatterjee at the University of Pennsylvania and
Jonathan Fugelsang at the University of Waterloo are using neuroscience
techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal
launching events in which one object causes another object to move. Both
temporal and spatial factors can be manipulated.[52]
See Causal_Reasoning_(Psychology) for more information.
*** Statistics and economics[edit] ***
Statistics and economics usually employ pre-existing data or experimental data
to infer causality by regression methods. The body of statistical techniques
involves substantial use of regression_analysis. Typically a linear
relationship such as
          y  i   =  a  0   +  a  1    x  1 , i   +  a  2    x  2 , i   + . . .
      +  a  k    x  k , i   +  e  i     {\displaystyle y_{i}=a_{0}+a_{1}x_
      {1,i}+a_{2}x_{2,i}+...+a_{k}x_{k,i}+e_{i}}  [y_{i}=a_{0}+a_{1}x_{1,i}+a_
      {2}x_{2,i}+...+a_{k}x_{k,i}+e_{i}]
is postulated, in which      y  i     {\displaystyle y_{i}}  [y_{i}] is the ith
observation of the dependent variable (hypothesized to be the caused variable),
x  j , i     {\displaystyle x_{j,i}}  [x_{j,i}] for j=1,...,k is the ith
observation on the jth independent variable (hypothesized to be a causative
variable), and      e  i     {\displaystyle e_{i}}  [e_{i}] is the error term
for the ith observation (containing the combined effects of all other causative
variables, which must be uncorrelated with the included independent variables).
If there is reason to believe that none of the      x  j     {\displaystyle x_
{j}}  [x_{j}]s is caused by y, then estimates of the coefficients      a  j
{\displaystyle a_{j}}  [a_{j}] are obtained. If the null hypothesis that      a
j   = 0   {\displaystyle a_{j}=0}  [a_{j}=0] is rejected, then the alternative
hypothesis that      a  j   &#x2260; 0   {\displaystyle a_{j}\neq 0}  [a_
{j}\neq 0] and equivalently that      x  j     {\displaystyle x_{j}}  [x_{j}]
causes y cannot be rejected. On the other hand, if the null hypothesis that
a  j   = 0   {\displaystyle a_{j}=0}  [a_{j}=0] cannot be rejected, then
equivalently the hypothesis of no causal effect of      x  j     {\displaystyle
x_{j}}  [x_{j}] on y cannot be rejected. Here the notion of causality is one of
contributory causality as discussed above: If the true value      a  j
&#x2260; 0   {\displaystyle a_{j}\neq 0}  [a_{j}\neq 0], then a change in
x  j     {\displaystyle x_{j}}  [x_{j}] will result in a change in y unless
some other causative variable(s), either included in the regression or implicit
in the error term, change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect; thus a
change in      x  j     {\displaystyle x_{j}}  [x_{j}] is not sufficient to
change y. Likewise, a change in      x  j     {\displaystyle x_{j}}  [x_{j}] is
not necessary to change y, because a change in y could be caused by something
implicit in the error term (or by some other causative explanatory variable
included in the model).
The above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse
causation, in which y would cause      x  j     {\displaystyle x_{j}}  [x_{j}].
This belief can be established in one of several ways. First, the variable
x  j     {\displaystyle x_{j}}  [x_{j}] may be a non-economic variable: for
example, if rainfall amount      x  j     {\displaystyle x_{j}}  [x_{j}] is
hypothesized to affect the futures price y of some agricultural commodity, it
is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount (provided
that cloud seeding is never attempted). Second, the instrumental_variables
technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role
for other variables (instruments) that are known to be unaffected by the
dependent variable. Third, the principle that effects cannot precede causes can
be invoked, by including on the right side of the regression only variables
that precede in time the dependent variable; this principle is invoked, for
example, in testing for Granger_causality and in its multivariate analog,
vector_autoregression, both of which control for lagged values of the dependent
variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables.
Regression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as
regressors (explanatory variables). This helps to avoid false inferences of
causality due to the presence of a third, underlying, variable that influences
both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable:
its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including
it in the regression, so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect
effect through the potentially causative variable of interest.
Given the above procedures, coincidental (as opposed to causal) correlation can
be probabilistically rejected if data samples are large and if regression
results pass cross-validation tests showing that the correlations hold even for
data that were not used in the regression.
**** Management[edit] ****
Used in management and engineering, an Ishikawa_diagram shows the factors that
cause the effect. Smaller arrows connect the sub-causes to major causes.
For quality control in manufacturing in the 1960s, Kaoru_Ishikawa developed a
cause and effect diagram, known as an Ishikawa_diagram or fishbone diagram. The
diagram categorizes causes, such as into the six main categories shown here.
These categories are then sub-divided. Ishikawa's method identifies "causes" in
brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the
manufacturing process. These groups can then be labeled as categories in the
diagrams. The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control, and
they are used in other areas of management and in design and engineering.
Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction
between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. It seems that Ishikawa
was not even aware of this distinction.[53]
**** Humanities[edit] ****
*** History[edit] ***
In the discussion of history, events are sometimes considered as if in some way
being agents that can then bring about other historical events. Thus, the
combination of poor harvests, the hardships of the peasants, high taxes, lack
of representation of the people, and kingly ineptitude are among the causes of
the French_Revolution. This is a somewhat Platonic and Hegelian view that
reifies causes as ontological_entities. In Aristotelian terminology, this use
approximates to the case of the efficient cause.
Some philosophers of history such as Arthur_Danto have claimed that
"explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an
eventâsomething that happensâbut a change".[54] Like many practicing
historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which
bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the
elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an
individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and
metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the
break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".[55]
Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship
between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones,
and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts
and wider sets of conditions.[56] John_Gaddis has distinguished between
exceptional and general causes (following Marc_Bloch) and between "routine" and
"distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened
at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that
President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of
the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."[57] He has also pointed to the
difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes.[58] For his
part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used
in history: the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the
phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent
being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept,
which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions
of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is
"goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and
dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal
dispositions as the causes of phenomena".[59]
*** Law[edit] ***
Main article: Causation_(law)
According to law and jurisprudence, legal cause must be demonstrated to hold a
defendant liable for a crime or a tort (i.e. a civil wrong such as negligence
or trespass). It must be proven that causality, or a "sufficient causal link"
relates the defendant's actions to the criminal event or damage in question.
Causation is also an essential legal element that must be proven to qualify for
remedy measures under international_trade_law.[60]
**** Theology[edit] ****
Note the concept of omnicausality in Abrahamic theology, which is the belief
that God has set in motion all events at the dawn of time; he is the determiner
and the cause of all things. It is therefore an attempt to rectify the apparent
incompatibility between determinism and the existence of an omnipotent_god.[61]

**** Hindu philosophy[edit] ****
See also: Karma
Vedic_period (c. 1750â500 BCE) literature has karma's Eastern origins.[62]
Karma is the belief held by Sanathana_Dharma and major religions that a
person's actions cause certain effects in the current life and/or in future
life, positively or negatively. The various philosophical schools (darsanas)
provide different accounts of the subject. The doctrine of satkaryavada affirms
that the effect inheres in the cause in some way. The effect is thus either a
real or apparent modification of the cause. The doctrine of asatkaryavada
affirms that the effect does not inhere in the cause, but is a new arising. See
Nyaya for some details of the theory of causation in the Nyaya school. In
Brahma_Samhita, Brahma describes Krishna as the prime cause of all causes.[63]
Bhagavad-gÄ«tÄ_18.14 identifies five causes for any action (knowing which it
can be perfected): the body, the individual soul, the senses, the efforts and
the supersoul.
According to Monier-Williams, in the NyÄya causation theory from Sutra I.2.I,2
in the Vaisheshika philosophy, from causal non-existence is effectual non-
existence; but, not effectual non-existence from causal non-existence. A cause
precedes an effect. With a threads and cloth metaphors, three causes are:
   1. Co-inherence cause: resulting from substantial contact, 'substantial
      causes', threads are substantial to cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's
      material cause.
   2. Non-substantial cause: Methods putting threads into cloth, corresponding
      to Aristotle's formal cause.
   3. Instrumental cause: Tools to make the cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's
      efficient cause.
Monier-Williams also proposed that Aristotle's and the Nyaya's causality are
considered conditional aggregates necessary to man's productive work.[64]
**** Buddhist philosophy[edit] ****
See also: PratÄ«tyasamutpÄda
The general or universal definition of pratityasamutpada (or "dependent
origination" or "dependent arising" or "interdependent co-arising") is that
everything arises in dependence upon multiple causes and conditions; nothing
exists as a singular, independent entity. A traditional example in Buddhist
texts is of three sticks standing upright and leaning against each other and
supporting each other. If one stick is taken away, the other two will fall to
the ground.[citation_needed]
Causality in the Chittamatrin Buddhist school approach, Asanga's (c. 400 CE)
mind-only Buddhist school, asserts that objects cause consciousness in the
mind's image. Because causes precede effects, which must be different entities,
then subject and object are different. For this school, there are no objects
which are entities external to a perceiving consciousness. The Chittamatrin and
the Yogachara Svatantrika schools accept that there are no objects external to
the observer's causality. This largely follows the Nikayas approach.[65][66]
[67][68]
The AbhidharmakoÅakÄrikÄ approach is Vasubandhu's Abhidharma commentary text
in the SarvÄstivÄda school (c. 500 CE). It has four intricate causal
conditioning constructions with the: 1) root cause, 2) immediate antecedent, 3)
object support, and 4) predominance. Then, the six causes are: 1)
instrumentality (kÄraá¹ahetu), deemed the primary factor in result
production; 2) simultaneity or coexistence, which connects phenomena that arise
simultaneously; 3) homogeneity, explaining the homogenous flow that evokes
phenomena continuity; 4) association, which operates only between mental
factors and explains why consciousness appears as assemblages to mental
factors; 5) dominance, which forms one's habitual cognitive and behaviorist
dispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the actively wholesome
or unwholesome result. The four conditions and six causes interact with each
other in explaining phenomenal experience: for instance, each conscious moment
acts both as the homogenous cause, as well as the immediate antecedent
consciousness condition rise, and its concomitants, in a subsequent moment.
[citation_needed]
The Vaibhashika (c. 500 CE) is an early_buddhist_school which favors direct
object contact and accepts simultaneous cause and effects. This is based in the
consciousness example which says, intentions and feelings are mutually
accompanying mental factors that support each other like poles in tripod. In
contrast, simultaneous cause and effect rejectors say that if the effect
already exists, then it cannot effect the same way again. How past, present and
future are accepted is a basis for various Buddhist school's causality
viewpoints.[69][70][71]
All the classic Buddhist schools teach karma. "The law of karma is a special
instance of the law of cause and effect, according to which all our actions of
body, speech, and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects."
[72]
**** Bahaâi[edit] ****
The Baha'i concept of causation has been a unifying force for this young
religion. The belief in a common biological and ideological ancestry has made
it possible for Baha'is to recognize Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad.
Unfortunately, this has led to the systematic persecution of Baha'is by many
caliphates.[73]
**** Western philosophy[edit] ****
*** Aristotelian[edit] ***
Main articles: Four_causes and Potentiality_and_actuality
Aristotle identified four kinds of answer or explanatory mode to various "Why?"
questions. He thought that, for any given topic, all four kinds of explanatory
mode were important, each in its own right. As a result of traditional
specialized philosophical peculiarities of language, with translations between
ancient Greek, Latin, and English, the word 'cause' is nowadays in specialized
philosophical writings used to label Aristotle's four kinds.[23][74] In
ordinary language, there are various meanings of the word cause, the commonest
referring to efficient cause, the topic of the present article.
    * Material_cause, the material whence a thing has come or that which
      persists while it changes, as for example, one's mother or the bronze of
      a statue (see also substance_theory).[75]
    * Formal_cause, whereby a thing's dynamic form or static shape determines
      the thing's properties and function, as a human differs from a statue of
      a human or as a statue differs from a lump of bronze.[76]
    * Efficient_cause, which imparts the first relevant movement, as a human
      lifts a rock or raises a statue. This is the main topic of the present
      article.
    * Final_cause, the criterion of completion, or the end; it may refer to an
      action or to an inanimate process. Examples: Socrates takes a walk after
      dinner for the sake of his health; earth falls to the lowest level
      because that is its nature.
Of Aristotle's four kinds or explanatory modes, only one, the 'efficient cause'
is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article. The
other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition, structure
and dynamics, and, again, criterion of completion. The word that Aristotle used
was Î±á¼°ÏÎ¯Î±. For the present purpose, that Greek word would be better
translated as "explanation" than as "cause" as those words are most often used
in current English. Another translation of Aristotle is that he meant "the four
Becauses" as four kinds of answer to "why" questions.[23]
Aristotle assumed efficient causality as referring to a basic fact of
experience, not explicable by, or reducible to, anything more fundamental or
basic.
In some works of Aristotle, the four causes are listed as (1) the essential
cause, (2) the logical ground, (3) the moving cause, and (4) the final cause.
In this listing, a statement of essential cause is a demonstration that an
indicated object conforms to a definition of the word that refers to it. A
statement of logical ground is an argument as to why an object statement is
true. These are further examples of the idea that a "cause" in general in the
context of Aristotle's usage is an "explanation".[23]
The word "efficient" used here can also be translated from Aristotle as
"moving" or "initiating".[23]
Efficient causation was connected with Aristotelian_physics, which recognized
the four_elements (earth, air, fire, water), and added the fifth_element
(aether). Water and earth by their intrinsic property gravitas or heaviness
intrinsically fall toward, whereas air and fire by their intrinsic property
levitas or lightness intrinsically rise away from, Earth's centerâthe
motionless center of the universeâin a straight line while accelerating
during the substance's approach to its natural place.
As air remained on Earth, however, and did not escape Earth while eventually
achieving infinite speedâan absurdityâAristotle inferred that the universe
is finite in size and contains an invisible substance that held planet Earth
and its atmosphere, the sublunary_sphere, centered in the universe. And since
celestial bodies exhibit perpetual, unaccelerated motion orbiting planet Earth
in unchanging relations, Aristotle inferred that the fifth element, aither,
that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves in perpetual
circles, the only constant motion between two points. (An object traveling a
straight line from point A to B and back must stop at either point before
returning to the other.)
Left to itself, a thing exhibits natural motion, but canâaccording to
Aristotelian_metaphysicsâexhibit enforced motion imparted by an efficient
cause. The form of plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and
reproduction, the form of animals adds locomotion, and the form of humankind
adds reason atop these. A rock normally exhibits natural motionâexplained by
the rock's material cause of being composed of the element earthâbut a living
thing can lift the rock, an enforced motion diverting the rock from its natural
place and natural motion. As a further kind of explanation, Aristotle
identified the final cause, specifying a purpose or criterion of completion in
light of which something should be understood.
Aristotle himself explained,
     Cause means
     (a) in one sense, that as the result of whose presence something
     comes into beingâe.g., the bronze of a statue and the silver of a
     cup, and the classes which contain these [i.e., the material cause];
     (b) in another sense, the form or pattern; that is, the essential
     formula and the classes which contain itâe.g. the ratio 2:1 and
     number in general is the cause of the octaveâand the parts of the
     formula [i.e., the formal cause].
     (c) The source of the first beginning of change or rest; e.g. the man
     who plans is a cause, and the father is the cause of the child, and
     in general that which produces is the cause of that which is
     produced, and that which changes of that which is changed [i.e., the
     efficient cause].
     (d) The same as "end"; i.e. the final cause; e.g., as the "end" of
     walking is health. For why does a man walk? "To be healthy", we say,
     and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause [the
     final cause].
     (e) All those means towards the end which arise at the instigation of
     something else, as, e.g., fat-reducing, purging, drugs and
     instruments are causes of health; for they all have the end as their
     object, although they differ from each other as being some
     instruments, others actions [i.e., necessary conditions].
     â Metaphysics, Book 5, section 1013a, translated by Hugh Tredennick
     [77]
Aristotle further discerned two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation
and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and accidental, can be
spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language
refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects are assigned to
generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, and actual effects to
operating causes.
Averting infinite_regress, Aristotle inferred the first moverâan unmoved
mover. The first mover's motion, too, must have been caused, but, being an
unmoved mover, must have moved only toward a particular goal or desire.
*** Middle Ages[edit] ***
In line with Aristotelian cosmology, Thomas_Aquinas posed a hierarchy
prioritizing Aristotle's four causes: "final > efficient > material > formal".
[78] Aquinas sought to identify the first efficient causeânow simply first
causeâas everyone would agree, said Aquinas, to call it God. Later in the
Middle Ages, many scholars conceded that the first cause was God, but explained
that many earthly events occur within God's design or plan, and thereby
scholars sought freedom to investigate the numerous secondary causes.[79]
*** After the Middle Ages[edit] ***
See also: Humean_definition_of_causality
For Aristotelian philosophy before Aquinas, the word cause had a broad meaning.
It meant 'answer to a why question' or 'explanation', and Aristotelian scholars
recognized four kinds of such answers. With the end of the Middle_Ages, in many
philosophical usages, the meaning of the word 'cause' narrowed. It often lost
that broad meaning, and was restricted to just one of the four kinds. For
authors such as NiccolÃ²_Machiavelli, in the field of political thinking, and
Francis_Bacon, concerning science more generally, Aristotle's moving cause was
the focus of their interest. A widely used modern definition of causality in
this newly narrowed sense was assumed by David_Hume.[78] He undertook an
epistemological and metaphysical investigation of the notion of moving cause.
He denied that we can ever perceive cause and effect, except by developing a
habit or custom of mind where we come to associate two types of object or
event, always contiguous and occurring one after the other.[80] In Part III,
section XV of his book A_Treatise_of_Human_Nature, Hume expanded this to a list
of eight ways of judging whether two things might be cause and effect. The
first three:
      1. "The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time."
      2. "The cause must be prior to the effect."
      3. "There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect. 'Tis
      chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation."
And then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our
experience and which are "the source of most of our philosophical reasonings":
      4. "The same cause always produces the same effect, and the same effect
      never arises but from the same cause. This principle we derive from
      experience, and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings."
      5. Hanging upon the above, Hume says that "where several different
      objects produce the same effect, it must be by means of some quality,
      which we discover to be common amongst them."
      6. And "founded on the same reason": "The difference in the effects of
      two resembling objects must proceed from that particular, in which they
      differ."
And then two more:
      7. "When any object increases or diminishes with the increase or
      diminution of its cause, 'tis to be regarded as a compounded effect,
      deriv'd from the union of the several different effects, which arise from
      the several different parts of the cause."
      8. An "object, which exists for any time in its full perfection without
      any effect, is not the sole cause of that effect, but requires to be
      assisted by some other principle, which may forward its influence and
      operation."
In 1949, physicist Max_Born distinguished determination from causality. For
him, determination meant that actual events are so linked by laws of nature
that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can be made from
sufficient present data about them. He describes two kinds of causation: nomic
or generic causation and singular causation. Nomic causality means that cause
and effect are linked by more or less certain or probabilistic general laws
covering many possible or potential instances; this can be recognized as a
probabilized version of Hume's criterion 3. An occasion of singular causation
is a particular occurrence of a definite complex of events that are physically
linked by antecedence and contiguity, which may be recognized as criteria 1 and
2.[13]

      12 March 2018. Multiple causation has been defended, and even taken for
      granted, by the most diverse thinkers [...] simple causation is suspected
      of artificiality on account of its very simplicity. Granted, the
      assignment of a single cause (or effect) to a set of effects (or causes)
      may be a superficial, nonilluminating hypothesis. But so is usually the
      hypothesis of simple causation. Why should we remain satisfied with
      statements of causation, instead of attempting to go beyond the first
      simple relation that is found?

      relationships in general are, what it is for one thing to cause another,,
      or what it is for nature to obey causal laws. As I understand it, this is
      an ontological question, a question about how the world goes on."

  85. ^Falcon, Andrea (2012). Edward N. Zalta (ed.). "Aristotle_on_Causality".
      The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 ed.). In the
      Physics, Aristotle builds on his general account of the four causes by
      developing explanatory principles that are specific to the study of
      nature. Here Aristotle insists that all four modes of explanation are
      called for in the study of natural phenomena, and that the job of "the
      student of nature is to bring the why-question back to them all in the
      way appropriate to the science of nature" (Phys. 198 a 21â23). The best
      way to understand this methodological recommendation is the following:
      the science of nature is concerned with natural bodies insofar as they
      are subject to change, and the job of the student of nature is to provide
      the explanation of their natural change. The factors that are involved in
      the explanation of natural change turn out to be matter, form, that which
      produces the change, and the end of this change. Note that Aristotle does
      not say that all four explanatory factors are involved in the explanation
      of each and every instance of natural change. Rather, he says that an
      adequate explanation of natural change may involve a reference to all of
      them. Aristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the
      four causes: the form and the end often coincide, and they are formally
      the same as that which produces the change (Phys. 198 a 23â26).
