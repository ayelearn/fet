Sociobiology is a field of biology that aims to examine and explain social
behavior in terms of evolution. It draws from disciplines including ethology,
anthropology, evolution, zoology, archaeology, and population_genetics. Within
the study of human societies, sociobiology is closely allied to Darwinian
anthropology, human_behavioral_ecology and evolutionary_psychology.
Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating_patterns, territorial
fights, pack_hunting, and the hive society of social_insects. It argues that
just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting
with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of
advantageous social behavior.
While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s, the
concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of E._O._Wilson's
book Sociobiology:_The_New_Synthesis in 1975. The new field quickly became the
subject of controversy. Critics, led by Richard_Lewontin and Stephen_Jay_Gould,
argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as
aggressiveness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology.
Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between
nature_and_nurture.

***** Definition[edit] *****
E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as "the extension of population biology and
evolutionary theory to social organization".[1]
Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and
individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by natural
selection. It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time,
similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It
predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily
successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of
complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.
The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection.
Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one's genes in the
population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain
genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be
inherited from generation to generation.[2]
For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they
did not sire. This behavior_is_adaptive because killing the cubs eliminates
competition for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into
heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population.
Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being
inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas
non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in
reproducing.[3]
***** History[edit] *****
E._O._Wilson, a central figure in the history of sociobiology, from the
publication in 1975 of his book Sociobiology:_The_New_Synthesis
The philosopher of biology Daniel_Dennett suggested that the political
philosopher Thomas_Hobbes was the first sociobiologist, arguing that in his
1651 book Leviathan Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society
from an amoral sociobiological perspective.[4]
The geneticist of animal behavior John_Paul_Scott coined the word sociobiology
at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a
conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior
research[5][6]. With John Paul Scott's organizational efforts, a "Section of
Animal Behavior and Sociobiology" of the ESA (acronym stands for?) was created
in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of
Zoology in 1958. In 1956, E._O._Wilson came in contact this emerging
sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close
relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his
own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques,
using statistics, and was hired as a "sociobiologist" at the Yerkes Regional
Primate Research Center in 1965.[6] Wilson's sociobiology is different from
John_Paul_Scott's or Altmann's, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of
social behavior centered on the maximisation of the genetic fitness by W._D.
Hamilton, Robert_Trivers, John_Maynard_Smith, and George_R._Price. The three
sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist
studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing
alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when "biology in the
field" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by "modern" practices of science
(laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).[7][6]
Once a specialist term, "sociobiology" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson
published his book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, which sparked an intense
controversy. Since then "sociobiology" has largely been equated with Wilson's
vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the
evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as altruism, aggression,
and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson's own research specialty) and other
Hymenoptera, but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on
behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after
the discovery of evolution itself. Peter_Kropotkin's Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of
Evolution, written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter
of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and
Wilson later wrote a Pulitzer_Prize winning book, On_Human_Nature, that
addressed human behavior specifically.[6][8]
Edward H. Hagen writes in The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology that
sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to
humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century."
"Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all
biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field
biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased
dramatically and continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as
Nature and Science. The more general term behavioral_ecology is commonly
substituted for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.
[9]
***** Theory[edit] *****
Sociobiologists maintain that human_behavior, as well as nonhuman animal
behavior, can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They
contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in
terms of evolutionary considerations.
Natural_selection is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary
traits which increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce will be
more greatly represented in subsequent generations, i.e., they will be
"selected for". Thus, inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an organism
a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to
survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in
nonhuman animal_species has been multiply demonstrated by biologists, and it
has become a foundation of evolutionary_biology. However, there is continued
resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to
humans, particularly from within the social sciences, where culture has long
been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior.
Nikolaas_Tinbergen, whose work influenced sociobiology
Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
    * Certain behavioral traits are inherited,
    * Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection.
      Therefore, these traits were probably "adaptive" in the environment in
      which the species evolved.
Sociobiology uses Nikolaas_Tinbergen's four_categories_of_questions and
explanations of animal behavior. Two categories are at the species level; two,
at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called "ultimate
explanations") are
    * the function (i.e., adaptation) that a behavior serves and
    * the evolutionary process (i.e., phylogeny) that resulted in this
      functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called "proximate explanations") are
    * the development of the individual (i.e., ontogeny) and
    * the proximate mechanism (e.g., brain_anatomy and hormones).
Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a
result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often
interested in instinctive, or intuitive behavior, and in explaining the
similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example,
mothers within many species of mammals â including humans â are very
protective of their offspring. Sociobiologists reason that this protective
behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the
individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection
would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed
to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral
adaptations, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.
Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a
result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also
act upon groups.[10] The mechanisms responsible for group_selection employ
paradigms and population statistics borrowed from evolutionary_game_theory.
Altruism is defined as "a concern for the welfare of others". If altruism is
genetically determined, then altruistic individuals must reproduce their own
altruistic genetic traits for altruism to survive, but when altruists lavish
their resources on non-altruists at the expense of their own kind, the
altruists tend to die out and the others tend to increase. An extreme example
is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier. This example
raises the question of how altruistic genes can be passed on if this soldier
dies without having any children.[11]
Within sociobiology, a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological
hypothesis by finding an evolutionarily_stable_strategy that matches the
observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove, but
usually, it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by
establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the
strategy, and those expressed in a population.
Altruism between social_insects and littermates has been explained in such a
way. Altruistic behavior, behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of
others at the apparent expense of the altruist, in some animals has been
correlated to the degree of genome shared between altruistic individuals. A
quantitative description of infanticide by male harem-mating animals when the
alpha_male is displaced as well as rodent female infanticide and fetal
resorption are active areas of study. In general, females with more bearing
opportunities may value offspring less, and may also arrange bearing
opportunities to maximize the food and protection from mates.
An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an
ecological balance. Just as an expansion of a sheep population might encourage
the expansion of a wolf population, an expansion of altruistic traits within a
gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent
traits.
Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such
as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and IQ have high heritability. The
researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that
heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural
factors may have on those traits.[12][13]
Criminality is actively under study, but extremely controversial. There are
arguments that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive.[14]
The novelist Elias_Canetti also has noted applications of sociobiological
theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.[15]
***** Support for premise[edit] *****
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behaviour. For
example, the transcription_factor FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in
maintaining the serotonergic_system in the brain, is required for normal
aggressive and anxiety-like behavior.[16] Thus, when FEV is genetically deleted
from the mouse genome, male mice will instantly attack other males, whereas
their wild-type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent
behaviour. In addition, FEV has been shown to be required for correct maternal
behaviour in mice, such that offspring of mothers without the FEV factor do not
survive unless cross-fostered to other wild-type female mice.[17]
A genetic basis for instinctive behavioural traits among non-human species,
such as in the above example, is commonly accepted among many biologists;
however, attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviours in
human societies has remained extremely controversial.[18][19]
***** Reception[edit] *****
Steven_Pinker argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a
fear of biological_determinism,[a] accusing among others Stephen_Jay_Gould and
Richard_Lewontin of being "radical scientists", whose stance on human nature is
influenced by politics rather than science,[21] while Lewontin, Steven_Rose and
Leon_Kamin, who drew a distinction between the politics and history of an idea
and its scientific validity,[22] argue that sociobiology fails on scientific
grounds. Gould grouped sociobiology with eugenics, criticizing both in his book
The_Mismeasure_of_Man.[23]
Noam_Chomsky has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a
1976 meeting of the Sociobiology_Study_Group, as reported by Ullica
SegerstrÃ¥le, Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed
notion of human nature.[24] Chomsky argued that human beings are biological
organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the "blank
slate" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of
Steven Pinker's and others' work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975
Reflections on Language.[25] Chomsky further hinted at the possible
reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a
discussion of Peter_Kropotkin's Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution, which
focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies
were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.[26]
Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what ought to be, only what
is the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of
sociobiology readily slips from "is" to "ought",[22] an instance of the
naturalistic_fallacy. Pinker has argued that opposition to stances considered
anti-social, such as ethnic_nepotism, is based on moral assumptions, meaning
that such opposition is not falsifiable by scientific advances.[27] The history
of this debate, and others related to it, are covered in detail by Cronin_
(1993), SegerstrÃ¥le_(2000), and Alcock_(2001).

      29 June 2010. Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly
      manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to
      do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90%
      heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic
      background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak,
      2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).

      29 October 2010. But back to the question: What does heritability mean?
      Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a
      commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to
      be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains
      why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated
      over the years. . . . Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong.
      Heritability isn't an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of
      time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of
      traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of
      psychological phenomena would be revealed.
