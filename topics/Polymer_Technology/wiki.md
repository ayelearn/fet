IUPAC definition
A molecule of high relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially
comprises the multiple repetition of units derived, actually or conceptually,
from molecules of low relative molecular mass.[2]
A polymer (/ËpÉlÉªmÉr/;[3][4] Greek poly-, "many" + -mer, "part") is a large
molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits.[5] Due to their
broad range of properties,[6] both synthetic and natural polymers play
essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life.[7] Polymers range from
familiar synthetic_plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as
DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function.
Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many
small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular_mass
relative to small_molecule compounds produces unique physical properties,
including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and
semicrystalline structures rather than crystals. The terms polymer and resin
are often synonymous with plastic.
The term "polymer" derives from the Greek word ÏÎ¿Î»ÏÏ (polus, meaning
"many, much") and Î¼Î­ÏÎ¿Ï (meros, meaning "part"), and refers to a molecule
whose structure is composed of multiple repeating units, from which originates
a characteristic of high relative_molecular_mass and attendant properties.[2]
The units composing polymers derive, actually or conceptually, from molecules
of low relative molecular mass.[2] The term was coined in 1833 by JÃ¶ns_Jacob
Berzelius, though with_a_definition distinct from the modern IUPAC definition.
[8][9] The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular
structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann_Staudinger,[10] who spent the next
decade finding experimental evidence for this hypothesis.[11]
Polymers are studied in the fields of biophysics and macromolecular_science,
and polymer_science (which includes polymer_chemistry and polymer_physics).
Historically, products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent
chemical_bonds have been the primary focus of polymer_science; emerging
important areas of the science now focus on non-covalent links. Polyisoprene of
latex rubber is an example of a natural/biological polymer, and the polystyrene
of styrofoam is an example of a synthetic polymer. In biological contexts,
essentially all biological macromoleculesâi.e., proteins (polyamides),
nucleic_acids (polynucleotides), and polysaccharidesâare purely polymeric, or
are composed in large part of polymeric componentsâe.g., isoprenylated/lipid-
modified glycoproteins, where small lipidic molecules and oligosaccharide
modifications occur on the polyamide backbone of the protein.[12]
The simplest theoretical models for polymers are ideal_chains.

***** Common examples *****
See also: Polymer_classes
Polymers are of two types: naturally occurring and synthetic or man made.
Natural_polymeric_materials such as hemp, shellac, amber, wool, silk and
natural rubber have been used for centuries. A variety of other natural
polymers exist, such as cellulose, which is the main constituent of wood and
paper.
The list_of_synthetic_polymers, roughly in order of worldwide demand, includes
polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl_chloride, synthetic_rubber,
phenol_formaldehyde_resin (or Bakelite), neoprene, nylon, polyacrylonitrile,
PVB, silicone, and many more. More than 330 million tons of these polymers are
made every year (2015).[13]
Most commonly, the continuously linked backbone of a polymer used for the
preparation of plastics consists mainly of carbon atoms. A simple example is
polyethylene ('polythene' in British English), whose repeating unit is based on
ethylene monomer. Many other structures do exist; for example, elements such as
silicon form familiar materials such as silicones, examples being Silly_Putty
and waterproof plumbing sealant. Oxygen is also commonly present in polymer
backbones, such as those of polyethylene_glycol, polysaccharides (in glycosidic
bonds), and DNA (in phosphodiester_bonds).
***** Synthesis *****
Main article: Polymerization
The repeating unit of the polymer polypropylene
Polymerization is the process of combining many small_molecules known as
monomers into a covalently bonded chain or network. During the polymerization
process, some chemical groups may be lost from each monomer. This happens in
the polymerization of PET_polyester. The monomers are terephthalic_acid
(HOOCâC6H4âCOOH) and ethylene_glycol (HOâCH2âCH2âOH) but the
repeating unit is âOCâC6H4âCOOâCH2âCH2âOâ, which corresponds to
the combination of the two monomers with the loss of two water molecules. The
distinct piece of each monomer that is incorporated into the polymer is known
as a repeat_unit or monomer residue.
Laboratory synthetic methods are generally divided into two categories, step-
growth_polymerization and chain-growth_polymerization.[14] The essential
difference between the two is that in chain growth polymerization, monomers are
added to the chain one at a time only,[15] such as in polyethylene, whereas in
step-growth polymerization chains of monomers may combine with one another
directly,[16] such as in polyester. Newer methods, such as plasma
polymerization do not fit neatly into either category. Synthetic polymerization
reactions may be carried out with or without a catalyst. Laboratory synthesis
of biopolymers, especially of proteins, is an area of intensive research.
**** Biological synthesis ****
Main article: Biopolymer
Microstructure of part of a DNA double_helix biopolymer
There are three main classes of biopolymers: polysaccharides, polypeptides, and
polynucleotides. In living cells, they may be synthesized by enzyme-mediated
processes, such as the formation of DNA catalyzed by DNA_polymerase. The
synthesis_of_proteins involves multiple enzyme-mediated processes to transcribe
genetic information from the DNA to RNA and subsequently translate that
information to synthesize the specified protein from amino_acids. The protein
may be modified_further following translation in order to provide appropriate
structure and functioning. There are other biopolymers such as rubber, suberin,
melanin and lignin.
**** Modification of natural polymers ****
Naturally occurring polymers such as cotton, starch and rubber were familiar
materials for years before synthetic polymers such as polyethene and perspex
appeared on the market. Many commercially important polymers are synthesized by
chemical modification of naturally occurring polymers. Prominent examples
include the reaction of nitric acid and cellulose to form nitrocellulose and
the formation of vulcanized_rubber by heating natural rubber in the presence of
sulfur. Ways in which polymers can be modified include oxidation, cross-linking
and endcapping.
Especially in the production of polymers the gas separation by membranes has
acquired increasing importance in the petrochemical_industry and is now a
relatively well-established unit operation. The process of polymer degassing is
necessary to suit polymer for extrusion and pelletizing, increasing safety,
environmental, and product quality aspects. Nitrogen is generally used for this
purpose, resulting in a vent gas primarily composed of monomers and nitrogen.
[17]
***** Properties *****
Polymer properties are broadly divided into several classes based on the scale
at which the property is defined as well as upon its physical basis.[18] The
most basic property of a polymer is the identity of its constituent monomers. A
second set of properties, known as microstructure, essentially describes the
arrangement of these monomers within the polymer at the scale of a single
chain. These basic structural properties play a major role in determining bulk
physical properties of the polymer, which describe how the polymer behaves as a
continuous macroscopic material. Chemical properties, at the nano-scale,
describe how the chains interact through various physical forces. At the macro-
scale, they describe how the bulk polymer interacts with other chemicals and
solvents.
**** Monomers and repeat units ****
The identity of the repeat units (monomer residues, also known as "mers")
comprising a polymer is its first and most important attribute. Polymer
nomenclature is generally based upon the type of monomer residues comprising
the polymer. Polymers which contain only a single type of repeat unit are known
as homopolymers, while polymers containing two or more types of repeat units
are known as copolymers.[19] Terpolymers contain three types of repeat units.
[20]
Poly(styrene) is composed only of styrene monomer residues, and is classified
as a homopolymer. Ethylene-vinyl_acetate contains more than one variety of
repeat unit and is a copolymer. Some biological polymers are composed of a
variety of different but structurally related monomer residues; for example,
polynucleotides such as DNA are composed of four types of nucleotide subunits.
A polymer molecule containing ionizable subunits is known as a polyelectrolyte
or ionomer.
**** Microstructure ****
Main article: Microstructure
The microstructure of a polymer (sometimes called configuration) relates to the
physical arrangement of monomer residues along the backbone of the chain.[21]
These are the elements of polymer structure that require the breaking of a
covalent bond in order to change. Structure has a strong influence on the other
properties of a polymer. For example, two samples of natural rubber may exhibit
different durability, even though their molecules comprise the same monomers.
*** Polymer architecture ***
Main article: Polymer_architecture
Branch point in a polymer
An important microstructural feature of a polymer is its architecture and
shape, which relates to the way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple
linear chain.[22] A branched_polymer molecule is composed of a main chain with
one or more substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers
include star_polymers, comb_polymers, brush_polymers, dendronized_polymers,
ladder_polymers, and dendrimers.[22] There exist also two-dimensional_polymers
which are composed of topologically planar repeat units. A polymer's
architecture affects many of its physical properties including, but not limited
to, solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass
transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A
variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material
with a range of architectures, for example Living_polymerization.
*** Chain length ***
A common means of expressing the length of a chain is the degree_of
polymerization, which quantifies the number of monomers incorporated into the
chain.[23][24] As with other molecules, a polymer's size may also be expressed
in terms of molecular_weight. Since synthetic polymerization techniques
typically yield a statistical distribution of chain lengths, the molecular
weight is expressed in terms of weighted averages. The number-average_molecular
weight (Mn) and weight-average_molecular_weight (Mw) are most commonly
reported.[25][26] The ratio of these two values (Mw / Mn) is the dispersity
(Ä), which is commonly used to express the width of the molecular weight
distribution.[27]
The physical properties[28] of polymer strongly depend on the length (or
equivalently, the molecular weight) of the polymer chain.[29] One important
example of the physical consequences of the molecular weight is the scaling of
the viscosity (resistance to flow) in the melt.[30] The influence of the
weight-average molecular weight (Mw) on the melt viscosity (Î·) depends on
whether the polymer is above or below the onset of entanglements. Below the
entanglement molecular weight[clarification_needed],     e t a , s i m    M  w
1     {\displaystyle eta,sim{M_{w}}^{1}}  [{\displaystyle eta,sim{M_{w}}^{1}}],
whereas above the entanglement molecular weight,     e t a , s i m    M  w
3.4     {\displaystyle eta,sim{M_{w}}^{3.4}}  [{\displaystyle eta,sim{M_{w}}^
{3.4}}]. In the latter case, increasing the polymer chain length 10-fold would
increase the viscosity over 1000 times.[31][page needed] Increasing chain
length furthermore tends to decrease chain mobility, increase strength and
toughness, and increase the glass_transition_temperature (Tg).[32] This is a
result of the increase in chain interactions such as Van_der_Waals_attractions
and entanglements that come with increased chain length.[33][34] These
interactions tend to fix the individual chains more strongly in position and
resist deformations and matrix breakup, both at higher stresses and higher
temperatures.
*** Monomer arrangement in copolymers ***
Main article: copolymer
[Different_types_of_copolymers]
Monomers within a copolymer may be organized along the backbone in a variety of
ways. A copolymer containing a controlled arrangement of monomers is called a
sequence-controlled_polymer.[35] Alternating, periodic and block copolymers are
simple examples of sequence-controlled_polymers.
    * Alternating copolymers possess two regularly alternating monomer
      residues:[36] [AB]n (structure 2 at right). An example is the equimolar
      copolymer of styrene and maleic_anhydride formed by free-radical chain-
      growth polymerization.[37] A step-growth copolymer such as Nylon_66 can
      also be considered a strictly alternating copolymer of diamine and diacid
      residues, but is often described as a homopolymer with the dimeric
      residue of one amine and one acid as a repeat unit.[38]
    * Periodic copolymers have monomer residue types arranged in a repeating
      sequence: [AnBm...] m being different from n.[citation_needed]
    * Statistical copolymers have monomer residues arranged according to a
      statistical rule. A statistical copolymer in which the probability of
      finding a particular type of monomer residue at a particular point in the
      chain is independent of the types of surrounding monomer residue may be
      referred to as a truly random copolymer[39][40] (structure 3). For
      example, the chain-growth copolymer of vinyl_chloride and vinyl_acetate
      is random.[37]
    * Block copolymers have long sequences of different monomer units[37][38]
      (structure 4). Polymers with two or three blocks of two distinct chemical
      species (e.g., A and B) are called diblock copolymers and triblock
      copolymers, respectively. Polymers with three blocks, each of a different
      chemical species (e.g., A, B, and C) are termed triblock terpolymers.
    * Graft_or_grafted_copolymers contain side chains or branches whose repeat
      units have a different composition or configuration than the main chain.
      [38] (structure 5) The branches are added on to a preformed main chain
      macromolecule.[37]
*** Tacticity ***
Main article: Tacticity
Tacticity describes the relative stereochemistry of chiral centers in
neighboring structural units within a macromolecule. There are three types of
tacticity: isotactic (all substituents on the same side), atactic (random
placement of substituents), and syndiotactic (alternating placement of
substituents).
**** Morphology ****
Polymer morphology generally describes the arrangement and microscale ordering
of polymer chains in space.
*** Crystallinity ***
When applied to polymers, the term crystalline has a somewhat ambiguous usage.
In some cases, the term crystalline finds identical usage to that used in
conventional crystallography. For example, the structure of a crystalline
protein or polynucleotide, such as a sample prepared for x-ray_crystallography,
may be defined in terms of a conventional unit cell composed of one or more
polymer molecules with cell dimensions of hundreds of angstroms or more. A
synthetic polymer may be loosely described as crystalline if it contains
regions of three-dimensional ordering on atomic (rather than macromolecular)
length scales, usually arising from intramolecular folding and/or stacking of
adjacent chains. Synthetic polymers may consist of both crystalline and
amorphous regions; the degree of crystallinity may be expressed in terms of a
weight fraction or volume fraction of crystalline material. Few synthetic
polymers are entirely crystalline.[41] The crystallinity of polymers is
characterized by their degree of crystallinity, ranging from zero for a
completely non-crystalline polymer to one for a theoretical completely
crystalline polymer. Polymers with microcrystalline regions are generally
tougher (can be bent more without breaking) and more impact-resistant than
totally amorphous polymers.[42] Polymers with a degree of crystallinity
approaching zero or one will tend to be transparent, while polymers with
intermediate degrees of crystallinity will tend to be opaque due to light
scattering by crystalline or glassy regions. For many polymers, reduced
crystallinity may also be associated with increased transparency.
*** Chain conformation ***
The space occupied by a polymer molecule is generally expressed in terms of
radius_of_gyration, which is an average distance from the center of mass of the
chain to the chain itself. Alternatively, it may be expressed in terms of
pervaded_volume, which is the volume of solution spanned by the polymer chain
and scales with the cube of the radius of gyration.[43]
**** Mechanical properties ****
A polyethylene sample that has necked under tension.
The bulk properties of a polymer are those most often of end-use interest.
These are the properties that dictate how the polymer actually behaves on a
macroscopic scale.
*** Tensile strength ***
The tensile_strength of a material quantifies how much elongating stress the
material will endure before failure.[44][45] This is very important in
applications that rely upon a polymer's physical strength or durability. For
example, a rubber band with a higher tensile strength will hold a greater
weight before snapping. In general, tensile strength increases with polymer
chain length and crosslinking of polymer chains.
*** Young's modulus of elasticity ***
Young's_modulus quantifies the elasticity of the polymer. It is defined, for
small strains, as the ratio of rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile
strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the
physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The modulus is strongly
dependent on temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent
elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the stress-strain curve when
the load is removed. Dynamic_mechanical_analysis or DMA measures this complex
modulus by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a
function of time.
**** Transport properties ****
Transport_properties such as diffusivity describe how rapidly molecules move
through the polymer matrix. These are very important in many applications of
polymers for films and membranes.
The movement of individual macromolecules occurs by a process called reptation
in which each chain molecule is constrained by entanglements with neighboring
chains to move within a virtual tube. The theory of reptation can explain
polymer molecule dynamics and viscoelasticity.[46]
**** Phase behavior ****
*** Crystallization and melting ***
Thermal transitions in (A) amorphous and (B) semicrystalline polymers,
represented as traces from differential_scanning_calorimetry. As the
temperature increases, both amorphous and semicrystalline polymers go through
the glass_transition (Tg). Amorphous polymers (A) do not exhibit other phase
transitions, though semicrystalline polymers (B) undergo crystallization and
melting (at temperatures Tc and Tm, respectively).
Depending on their chemical structures, polymers may be either semi-crystalline
or amorphous. Semi-crystalline polymers can undergo crystallization_and_melting
transitions, whereas amorphous polymers do not. In polymers, crystallization
and melting do not suggest solid-liquid phase transitions, as in the case of
water or other molecular fluids. Instead, crystallization and melting refer to
the phase transitions between two solid states (i.e., semi-crystalline and
amorphous). Crystallization occurs above the glass transition temperature (Tg)
and below the melting temperature (Tm).
*** Glass transition ***
All polymers (amorphous or semi-crystalline) go through glass_transitions. The
glass transition temperature (Tg) is a crucial physical parameter for polymer
manufacturing, processing, and use. Below Tg, molecular motions are frozen and
polymers are brittle and glassy. Above Tg, molecular motions are activated and
polymers are rubbery and viscous. The glass transition temperature may be
engineered by altering the degree of branching or crosslinking in the polymer
or by the addition of plasticizers.[47]
Whereas crystallization and melting are first-order phase_transitions, the
glass transition is not.[48] The glass transition shares features of second-
order phase transitions (such as discontinuity in the heat capacity, as shown
in the figure), but it is generally not considered a thermodynamic transition
between equilibrium states.  
*** Mixing behavior ***
Phase diagram of the typical mixing behavior of weakly interacting polymer
solutions, showing spinodal curves and binodal coexistence curves.
In general, polymeric mixtures are far less miscible than mixtures of small
molecule materials. This effect results from the fact that the driving force
for mixing is usually entropy, not interaction energy. In other words, miscible
materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other
is more favorable than their self-interaction, but because of an increase in
entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume
available to each component. This increase in entropy scales with the number of
particles (or moles) being mixed. Since polymeric molecules are much larger and
hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the
number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the
number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume. The energetics of mixing,
on the other hand, is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small
molecule mixtures. This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer
solutions and thereby making solvation less favorable, and thereby making the
availability of concentrated solutions of polymers far rarer than those of
small molecules.
Furthermore, the phase behavior of polymer solutions and mixtures is more
complex than that of small molecule mixtures. Whereas most small molecule
solutions exhibit only an upper_critical_solution_temperature phase transition,
at which phase separation occurs with cooling, polymer mixtures commonly
exhibit a lower_critical_solution_temperature phase transition, at which phase
separation occurs with heating.
In dilute solution, the properties of the polymer are characterized by the
interaction between the solvent and the polymer. In a good solvent, the polymer
appears swollen and occupies a large volume. In this scenario, intermolecular
forces between the solvent and monomer subunits dominate over intramolecular
interactions. In a bad solvent or poor solvent, intramolecular forces dominate
and the chain contracts. In the theta_solvent, or the state of the polymer
solution where the value of the second virial coefficient becomes 0, the
intermolecular polymer-solvent repulsion balances exactly the intramolecular
monomer-monomer attraction. Under the theta condition (also called the Flory
condition), the polymer behaves like an ideal random_coil. The transition
between the states is known as a coil-globule_transition.
*** Inclusion of plasticizers ***
Inclusion of plasticizers tends to lower Tg and increase polymer flexibility.
Plasticizers are generally small molecules that are chemically similar to the
polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and reduced
interchain interactions. A good example of the action of plasticizers is
related to polyvinylchlorides or PVCs. A uPVC, or unplasticized
polyvinylchloride, is used for things such as pipes. A pipe has no plasticizers
in it, because it needs to remain strong and heat-resistant. Plasticized PVC is
used in clothing for a flexible quality. Plasticizers are also put in some
types of cling film to make the polymer more flexible.
**** Chemical properties ****
The attractive forces between polymer chains play a large part in determining
polymer's properties. Because polymer chains are so long, these interchain
forces are amplified far beyond the attractions between conventional molecules.
Different side groups on the polymer can lend the polymer to ionic_bonding or
hydrogen_bonding between its own chains. These stronger forces typically result
in higher tensile strength and higher crystalline melting points.
The intermolecular forces in polymers can be affected by dipoles in the monomer
units. Polymers containing amide or carbonyl groups can form hydrogen_bonds
between adjacent chains; the partially positively charged hydrogen atoms in N-
H groups of one chain are strongly attracted to the partially negatively
charged oxygen atoms in C=O groups on another. These strong hydrogen bonds, for
example, result in the high tensile strength and melting point of polymers
containing urethane or urea linkages. Polyesters have dipole-dipole_bonding
between the oxygen atoms in C=O groups and the hydrogen atoms in H-C groups.
Dipole bonding is not as strong as hydrogen bonding, so a polyester's melting
point and strength are lower than Kevlar's (Twaron), but polyesters have
greater flexibility.
Ethene, however, has no permanent dipole. The attractive forces between
polyethylene chains arise from weak Van_der_Waals_forces. Molecules can be
thought of as being surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons. As two polymer
chains approach, their electron clouds repel one another. This has the effect
of lowering the electron density on one side of a polymer chain, creating a
slight positive dipole on this side. This charge is enough to attract the
second polymer chain. Van der Waals forces are quite weak, however, so
polyethylene can have a lower melting temperature compared to other polymers.
**** Optical properties ****
Polymers such as PMMA and HEMA:MMA are used as matrices in the gain medium of
solid-state_dye_lasers that are also known as polymer lasers. These polymers
have a high surface quality and are also highly transparent so that the laser
properties are dominated by the laser_dye used to dope the polymer matrix.
These type of lasers, that also belong to the class of organic_lasers, are
known to yield very narrow linewidths which is useful for spectroscopy and
analytical applications.[49] An important optical parameter in the polymer used
in laser applications is the change in refractive index with temperature also
known as dn/dT. For the polymers mentioned here the (dn/dT) ~ â1.4 Ã 10â4
in units of Kâ1 in the 297 â¤ T â¤ 337 K range.[50]
***** Standardized nomenclature *****
There are multiple conventions for naming polymer substances. Many commonly
used polymers, such as those found in consumer products, are referred to by a
common or trivial name. The trivial name is assigned based on historical
precedent or popular usage rather than a standardized naming convention. Both
the American_Chemical_Society (ACS)[51] and IUPAC[52] have proposed
standardized naming conventions; the ACS and IUPAC conventions are similar but
not identical.[53] Examples of the differences between the various naming
conventions are given in the table below:
Common name             ACS name                   IUPAC name
Poly(ethylene_oxide) or Poly(oxyethylene)          Poly(oxyethene)
PEO
Poly(ethylene           Poly(oxy-1,2-              Poly
terephthalate) or PET   ethanediyloxycarbonyl-1,4- (oxyetheneoxyterephthaloyl)
                        phenylenecarbonyl)
Nylon_6                 Poly[amino(1-oxo-1,6-      Poly[amino(1-oxohexan-1,6-
                        hexanediyl)]               diyl)]
In both standardized conventions, the polymers' names are intended to reflect
the monomer(s) from which they are synthesized rather than the precise nature
of the repeating subunit. For example, the polymer synthesized from the simple
alkene ethene is called polyethylene, retaining the -ene suffix even though the
double bond is removed during the polymerization process:

***** Characterization *****
Main article: Polymer_characterization
Polymer characterization spans many techniques for determining the chemical
composition, molecular weight distribution, and physical properties. Select
common techniques include the following:
    * Size-exclusion_chromatography (also called gel_permeation
      chromatography), sometimes coupled with static_light_scattering, can used
      to determine the number-average molecular weight, weight-average
      molecular weight, and dispersity.
    * Scattering techniques, such as static_light_scattering and small-angle
      neutron-scattering, are used to determine the dimensions (radius_of
      gyration) of macromolecules in solution or in the melt. These techniques
      are also used to characterize the three-dimensional structure of
      microphase-separated block_polymers, polymeric micelles, and other
      materials.
    * Wide-angle_X-ray_scattering (also called wide-angle X-ray diffraction) is
      used to determine the crystalline structure of polymers (or lack
      thereof).
    * Spectroscopy techniques, including Fourier-transform_infrared
      spectroscopy, Raman_spectroscopy, and nuclear_magnetic_resonance
      spectroscopy, can be used to determine the chemical composition.
    * Differential_scanning_calorimetry is used to characterize the thermal
      properties of polymers, such as the glass_transition_temperature,
      crystallization temperature, and melting temperature. The glass
      transition temperature can also be determined by dynamic_mechanical
      analysis.
    * Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability
      of the polymer.
    * Rheology is used to characterize the flow and deformation behavior. It
      can be used to determine the viscosity, modulus, and other rheological
      properties. Rheology is also often used to determine the molecular
      architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, branching)
      and to understand how the polymer can be processed.
***** Degradation *****
Main article: Polymer_degradation
A plastic item with thirty years of exposure to heat and cold, brake fluid, and
sunlight. Notice the discoloration, swelling, and crazing of the material
Polymer degradation is a change in the propertiesâtensile strength, color,
shape, or molecular weightâof a polymer or polymer-based product under the
influence of one or more environmental factors, such as heat, light, chemicals
and, in some cases, galvanic action. It is often due to the scission_of_polymer
chain_bonds via hydrolysis, leading to a decrease in the molecular mass of the
polymer.
Although such changes are frequently undesirable, in some cases, such as
biodegradation and recycling, they may be intended to prevent environmental
pollution. Degradation can also be useful in biomedical settings. For example,
a copolymer of polylactic_acid and polyglycolic_acid is employed in
hydrolysable stitches that slowly degrade after they are applied to a wound.
The susceptibility of a polymer to degradation depends on its structure.
Epoxies and chains containing aromatic functionalities are especially
susceptible to UV_degradation while polyesters are susceptible to degradation
by hydrolysis, while polymers containing an unsaturated backbone are especially
susceptible to ozone_cracking. Carbon based polymers are more susceptible to
thermal degradation than inorganic polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane and
are therefore not ideal for most high-temperature applications. High-
temperature matrices such as bismaleimides (BMI), condensation polyimides (with
an O-C-N bond), triazines (with a nitrogen (N) containing ring), and blends
thereof are susceptible to polymer degradation in the form of galvanic
corrosion when bare carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP is in contact with an
active metal such as aluminium in salt water environments.
The degradation of polymers to form smaller molecules may proceed by random
scission or specific scission. The degradation of polyethylene occurs by random
scissionâa random breakage of the bonds that hold the atoms of the polymer
together. When heated above 450 Â°C, polyethylene degrades to form a mixture of
hydrocarbons. Other polymers, such as poly(alpha-methylstyrene), undergo
specific chain scission with breakage occurring only at the ends. They
literally unzip or depolymerize back to the constituent monomer.
The sorting of polymer waste for recycling purposes may be facilitated by the
use of the Resin_identification_codes developed by the Society_of_the_Plastics
Industry to identify the type of plastic.
**** Product failure ****
Chlorine attack of acetal resin plumbing joint
In a finished product, such a change is to be prevented or delayed. Failure of
safety-critical polymer components can cause serious accidents, such as fire in
the case of cracked and degraded polymer fuel_lines. Chlorine-induced cracking
of acetal_resin plumbing joints and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious
floods in domestic properties, especially in the US in the 1990s. Traces of
chlorine in the water supply attacked vulnerable polymers in the plastic
plumbing, a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly
extruded or injection_molded. Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of
faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting which is a
serious stress_concentration.
Ozone-induced cracking in natural rubber tubing
Polymer oxidation has caused accidents involving medical_devices. One of the
oldest known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when
ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural_rubber and nitrile
rubber. They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved
during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and
cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric
sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use
degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical
characteristics of implantable devices.[54]
Fuel lines can also be attacked by another form of degradation: hydrolysis.
Nylon_6,6 is susceptible to acid_hydrolysis, and in one accident, a fractured
fuel line led to a spillage of diesel into the road. If diesel_fuel leaks onto
the road, accidents to following cars can be caused by the slippery nature of
the deposit, which is like black_ice. Furthermore, the asphalt_concrete road
surface will suffer damage as a result of the diesel fuel dissolving the
asphaltenes from the composite material, this resulting in the degradation of
the asphalt surface and structural integrity of the road.

      called them "polymeric". See: JÃ¶ns Jakob Berzelius (1833) "Isomerie,
      Unterscheidung von damit analogen VerhÃ¤ltnissen" (Isomeric, distinction
      from relations analogous to it), Jahres-Bericht Ã¼ber die Fortschitte der

***** Summary *****
                                  English: Thermal transitions in (A)
                                  amorphous and (B) semicrystalline
                                  polymers, represented as traces from
                                  differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
                                  Heat flow (exotherm down) is on the y-
                                  axis, and temperature is on the x-axis. As
                                  the temperature increases, both amorphous
DescriptionThermal transitions in and semicrystalline polymers go through
amorphous and semicrystalline     the glass transition (Tg). As the
polymers.tif                      temperature continues to increase,
                                  amorphous polymers (A) experience
                                  increasingly rapid molecular motions but
                                  do not exhibit other phase transitions.
                                  However, semicrystalline polymers (B)
                                  undergo crystallization and melting
                                  transitions (at temperatures Tc and Tm,
                                  respectively).
