  This article needs attention from an expert in Molecular and Cellular

  inaccurate, in part, completely failing to encompass the variants of the ED
  pathway in the archaebacteria (omitting many genera and confounding matters
  phylogenetically). See the talk_page for details. WikiProject_Molecular_and

Diagram of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (KDPG: 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-
phosphogluconate)
The EntnerâDoudoroff pathway (ED pathway) describes a pathwayâa series of
enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactionsâthat are active in bacterial primary
metabolism, a pathway that catabolizes glucose to pyruvic_acid using enzymes
distinct either from those used in glycolysis or the pentose_phosphate_pathway
[citation_needed] (the latter two being most widely used in the Bacteria).
[citation_needed] The ED pathway was first reported by Michael_Doudoroff and
Nathan Entner from the Bacteriology Department at the University of California,
Berkeley in 1952.[1][non-primary_source_needed] Recent work on the
EntnerâDuodoroff pathway has shown that its use is not restricted to
prokaryotes as was previously thought. Specifically, there is direct evidence
that Hordeum_vulgare uses the EntnerâDoudoroff pathway.[2] Use of the
EntnerâDuodoroff pathway among other plants such as mosses and ferns is also
probably widespread, based on preliminary sequencing data analysis.[2]
Distinct features of the EntnerâDoudoroff pathway are that it:
    * Uses 6-phosphogluconate_dehydratase and 2-keto-3-deoxyphosphogluconate
      aldolase to create pyruvate from glucose.[citation_needed]
    * Has a net yield of 1 ATP for every one glucose molecule processed, as
      well as 1 NADH and 1 NADPH.[citation_needed] In comparison, glycolysis
      has a net yield of 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules for every one
      glucose molecule metabolised.[citation_needed]

***** Organisms that use the Entner-Doudoroff pathway[edit] *****
         This section needs expansion with: the further known species that use
[[icon]] the ED or its variants, based on the reviews provided, and other
         modern secondary sources. You can help by adding_to_it. (August 2015)
                        This section relies too much on references to primary
[Question_book-new.svg] sources. Please improve this section by adding
                        secondary_or_tertiary_sources. (August 2015)(Learn_how
                        and_when_to_remove_this_template_message)
There are several bacteria that use the EntnerâDoudoroff pathway for
metabolism of glucose and are unable to catabolize via glycolysis (e.g.,
therefore lacking essential glycolytic enzymes such as phosphofructokinase as
seen in Pseudomonas).[3] Genera in which the pathway is prominent include Gram-
negative,[citation_needed] as listed below, Gram-positive bacteria such as
Enterococcus_faecalis,[4][full_citation_needed][page needed]
[better source needed] as well as several in the Archaea, the second distinct
branch of the prokaryotes (and the "third domain of life", after the
prokaryotic Eubacteria and the eukaryotes).[5] Most organisms that use the
pathway are aerobes, due to the low ATP yield per glucose molecule metabolised.
[citation_needed][clarification_needed]
Examples of bacteria using the pathway are:
    * Pseudomonas,[6] a genus of Gram-negative bacteria
    * Azotobacter,[7] a genus of Gram-negative bacteria
    * Rhizobium,[8] a plant root-associated and plant differentiation-active
      genus of Gram-negative bacteria
    * Agrobacterium,[9] a plant pathogen (oncogenic) genus of Gram-negative
      bacteria, also of biotechnologic use
    * Escherichia_coli,[6] a Gram-negative bacterium
    * Enterococcus_faecalis,[10] a Gram-positive bacterium
    * Zymomonas_mobilis,[citation_needed] a Gram-negative facultative_anaerobe
    * Xanthomonas_campestris,[11] a Gram negative bacterium which uses this
      pathway as main pathway for providing energy.
To date there is evidence of Eukaryotes using the pathway, suggesting it may be
more widespread than previously thought:
    * Hordeum_vulgare, barley uses the Entner-Duodoroff pathway.[2]
    * Phaeodactylum_tricornutum diatom model species presents functional
      phosphogluconate dehydratase and dehoxyphosphogluconate aldolase genes in
      its genome [12]
The Entner-Doudoroff pathway is present in many species of Archaea (caveat, see
following), whose metabolisms "resemble... in [their] complexity those of
Bacteria and lower Eukarya", and often include both this pathway and the
Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway of glycolysis, except most often as unique,
modified variants.[5]

****** Enzymes catalysing Entner Doudoroff Pathway (ED Pathway)[edit] ******

**** Conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate[edit] ****
The first step in ED is phosphorylation of glucose by a family of enzymes
called hexokinases to form glucose_6-phosphate (G6P). This reaction consumes
ATP, but it acts to keep the glucose concentration low, promoting continuous
transport of glucose into the cell through the plasma membrane transporters. In
addition, it blocks the glucose from leaking out â the cell lacks
transporters for G6P, and free diffusion out of the cell is prevented due to
the charged nature of G6P. Glucose may alternatively be formed from the
phosphorolysis or hydrolysis of intracellular starch or glycogen.
In animals, an isozyme of hexokinase called glucokinase is also used in the
liver, which has a much lower affinity for glucose (Km in the vicinity of
normal glycemia), and differs in regulatory properties. The different substrate
affinity and alternate regulation of this enzyme are a reflection of the role
of the liver in maintaining blood sugar levels.
Cofactors: Mg2+
**** Conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucanolactone[edit] ****
The G6P is then converted to 6-phosphoglucanolactone in the presence of enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase( an_oxido-reductase) with the presence of co-
enzyme nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate (NADP+) which will be
reduced to nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen along with a
free hydrogen atom H+
**** Conversion of 6-phosphoglucanolactone to 6-Phosphogluconic acid[edit] ****
The 6PGL is converted into 6-phosphogluconic acid in the presence of enzyme
hydrolase.
**** Conversion of 6-Phosphogluconic acid to 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphoglucanate
[edit] ****
The 6-phosphogluconic acid is converted to 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate
(KDPG) in the presence of enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase in which water
molecule is released to the surroundings.
**** Conversion of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphoglucanate to Pyruvate and
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate[edit] ****
The KDPG is then converted into pyruvate or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in the
presence of enzyme KDPG aldolase. when KDPG is converted into pyruvate, the ED
pathway for that pyruvate ends here and then the pyruvate goes into further
metabolic pathways (TCA cycle,ETC cycle etc..).
The other product (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) is further converted by entering
into the glycolysis pathway and at last get converted into pyruvate for further
metabolism.
**** Conversion of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate[edit]
****
The G3P is converted to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate int the presence of enzyme
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase( an oxido-recductase).
The aldehyde groups of the triose sugars are oxidised, and inorganic_phosphate
is added to them, forming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.
The hydrogen is used to reduce two molecules of NAD+, a hydrogen carrier, to
give NADH + H+ for each triose.
Hydrogen atom balance and charge balance are both maintained because the
phosphate (Pi) group actually exists in the form of a hydrogen_phosphate anion
(HPO42â), which dissociates to contribute the extra H+ ion and gives a net
charge of -3 on both sides.
**** Conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate[edit] ****
This step is the enzymatic transfer of a phosphate group from 1,3-
bisphosphoglycerate to ADP by phosphoglycerate_kinase, forming ATP and 3-
phosphoglycerate.
**** Conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate[edit] ****
Phosphoglycerate_mutase isomerises 3-phosphoglycerate into 2-phosphoglycerate.
**** Conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenol pyruvate[edit] ****
Enolase next converts 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. This reaction
is an elimination reaction involving an E1cB mechanism.
Cofactors: 2 Mg2+: one "conformational" ion to coordinate with the carboxylate
group of the substrate, and one "catalytic" ion that participates in the
dehydration
**** Conversion of phosphoenol pyruvate to pyruvate[edit] ****
A final substrate-level_phosphorylation now forms a molecule of pyruvate and a
molecule of ATP by means of the enzyme pyruvate_kinase. This serves as an
additional regulatory step, similar to the phosphoglycerate kinase step.
Cofactors: Mg2+
