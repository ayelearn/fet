Concrete, usually Portland cement concrete (for its visual resemblance to
Portland_stone),[2][3] is a composite_material composed of fine and coarse
aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens over
timeâmost frequently in the past a lime-based cement binder, such as lime
putty, but sometimes with other hydraulic_cements, such as a calcium_aluminate
cement or Portland Cement. It is distinguished from other, non-cementitious
types_of_concrete all binding some form of aggregate together, including
asphalt_concrete with a bitumen binder, which is frequently used for road
surfaces, and polymer_concretes that use polymers as a binder.
When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water, the mixture forms a
fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape. The cement reacts
with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the
materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses.[4]
Often, additives (such as pozzolans or superplasticizers) are included in the
mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished
material. Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as rebar)
embedded to provide tensile_strength, yielding reinforced_concrete.
Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials. Its usage
worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum
combined.[5] Globally, the ready-mix concrete industry, the largest segment of
the concrete market, is projected to exceed $600 billion in revenue by 2025.[6]

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word concrete comes from the Latin word "concretus" (meaning compact or
condensed),[7] the perfect passive participle of "concrescere", from "con-"
(together) and "crescere" (to grow).
***** History[edit] *****
**** Ancient times[edit] ****
Small-scale production of concrete-like materials was pioneered by the Nabatean
traders who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small
empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan from the 4th
century BC. They discovered the advantages of hydraulic_lime, with some self-
cementing properties, by 700 BC. They built kilns to supply mortar for the
construction of rubble_masonry houses, concrete floors, and underground
waterproof cisterns. They kept the cisterns secret as these enabled the
Nabataeans to thrive in the desert.[8] Some of these structures survive to this
day.[8]
**** Classical era[edit] ****
In the Ancient_Egyptian and later Roman eras, builders discovered that adding
volcanic_ash to the mix allowed it to set underwater.
Concrete floors were found in the royal palace of Tiryns, Greece, which dates
roughly to 1400â1200 BC.[9][10] Lime mortars were used in Greece, Crete, and
Cyprus in 800 BC. The Assyrian Jerwan Aqueduct (688 BC) made use of waterproof
concrete.[11] Concrete was used for construction in many ancient structures.
[12]
The Romans used concrete extensively from 300 BC to 476 AD, a span of more than
seven hundred years.[13] During the Roman Empire, Roman_concrete (or opus
caementicium) was made from quicklime, pozzolana and an aggregate of pumice.
Its widespread use in many Roman_structures, a key event in the history_of
architecture termed the Roman_architectural_revolution, freed Roman
construction from the restrictions of stone and brick materials. It enabled
revolutionary new designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension.
[14]
     Concrete, as the Romans knew it, was a new and revolutionary
     material. Laid in the shape of arches, vaults and domes, it quickly
     hardened into a rigid mass, free from many of the internal thrusts
     and strains that troubled the builders of similar structures in stone
     or brick.[15]
Modern tests show that opus caementicium had as much compressive strength as
modern Portland-cement concrete (ca. 200 kg/cm2 [20 MPa; 2,800 psi]).[16]
However, due to the absence of reinforcement, its tensile_strength was far
lower than modern reinforced_concrete, and its mode of application was also
different:[17]
     Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two
     important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and
     homogeneous, allowing it to be poured into forms rather than
     requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate,
     which, in Roman practice, often consisted of rubble. Second, integral
     reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in
     tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon the strength
     of the concrete bonding to resist tension.[18]
The long-term durability of Roman concrete structures has been found to be due
to its use of pyroclastic (volcanic) rock and ash, whereby crystallization of
strÃ¤tlingite and the coalescence of calciumâaluminum-silicateâhydrate
cementing binder helped give the concrete a greater degree of fracture
resistance even in seismically active environments.[19] Roman concrete is
significantly more resistant to erosion by seawater than modern concrete; it
used pyroclastic materials which react with seawater to form Al-tobermorite
crystals over time.[20][21]
Smeaton's Tower
The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures ensured that many
survive to the present day. The Baths_of_Caracalla in Rome are just one
example. Many Roman_aqueducts and bridges, such as the magnificent Pont_du_Gard
in southern France, have masonry cladding on a concrete core, as does the dome
of the Pantheon.
After the Roman Empire collapsed, use of concrete became rare until the
technology was redeveloped in the mid-18th century. Worldwide, concrete has
overtaken steel in tonnage of material used.[22]
**** Middle Ages[edit] ****
After the Roman Empire, the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly
reduced until the technique was all but forgotten between 500 and the 14th
century. From the 14th century to the mid-18th century, the use of cement
gradually returned. The Canal_du_Midi was built using concrete in 1670.[23]
**** Industrial era[edit] ****
Perhaps the greatest step forward in the modern use of concrete was Smeaton's
Tower, built by British engineer John_Smeaton in Devon, England, between 1756
and 1759. This third Eddystone_Lighthouse pioneered the use of hydraulic_lime
in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate.[24]
A method for producing Portland_cement was developed in England and patented by
Joseph_Aspdin in 1824.[25] Aspdin chose the name for its similarity to Portland
stone, which was quarried on the Isle_of_Portland in Dorset, England. His son
William continued developments into the 1840s, earning him recognition for the
development of "modern" Portland cement.[26]
Reinforced_concrete was invented in 1849 by Joseph_Monier.[27] and the first
house was built by FranÃ§ois_Coignet[28] in 1853. The first concrete reinforced
bridge was designed and built by Joseph_Monier in 1875.[29]
Famous concrete structures include the Hoover_Dam, the Panama_Canal and the
Roman Pantheon. The earliest large-scale users of concrete technology were the
ancient_Romans, and concrete was widely used in the Roman_Empire. The Colosseum
in Rome was built largely of concrete, and the concrete dome of the Pantheon is
the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.[30] Today, large concrete
structures (for example, dams and multi-story car parks) are usually made with
reinforced concrete.
***** Composition[edit] *****
Concrete is a composite material, comprising a matrix of aggregate (typically a
rocky material) and a binder (typically Portland_cement or asphalt), which
holds the matrix together. Many types_of_concrete are available, determined by
the formulations of binders and the types of aggregate used to suit the
application for the material. These variables determine strength, density, as
well as chemical and thermal resistance of the finished product.
Aggregate consists of large chunks of material in a concrete mix, generally a
coarse gravel or crushed rocks such as limestone, or granite, along with finer
materials such as sand.
A_cement, most commonly Portland cement, is the most prevalent kind of concrete
binder. For cementitious binders, water is mixed with the dry powder and
aggregate, which produces a semi-liquid slurry that can be shaped, typically by
pouring it into a form. The concrete solidifies and hardens through a chemical
process called hydration. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the
other components together, creating a robust stone-like material. Other
cementitious materials, such as fly_ash and slag_cement, are sometimes
addedâeither pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete
componentâand become a part of the binder for the aggregate. Admixtures are
added to modify the cure rate or properties of the material.
Mineral_admixtures use recycled materials as concrete ingredients. Conspicuous
materials include fly_ash, a by-product of coal-fired_power_plants; ground
granulated_blast_furnace_slag, a byproduct of steelmaking; and silica_fume, a
byproduct of industrial electric_arc_furnaces.
Structures employing Portland cement concrete usually include steel
reinforcement. Such concrete can be formulated with high compressive_strength,
but always has lower tensile_strength. Therefore, it is usually reinforced with
materials that are strong in tension, typically steel rebar.
Other materials can also be used as a concrete binder, the most prevalent
alternative is asphalt, which is used as the binder in asphalt_concrete.
The mix_design depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete
is mixed and delivered, and how it is placed to form the structure.
**** Cement[edit] ****
Main article: Cement
Several tons of bagged cement, about two minutes of output from a 10,000 ton
per day cement_kiln
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a
basic ingredient of concrete, mortar and many plasters. British masonry worker
Joseph_Aspdin patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the
similarity of its color to Portland_limestone, quarried from the English Isle
of_Portland and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a
mixture of calcium silicates (alite, belite), aluminates and
ferritesâcompounds which combine calcium, silicon, aluminum and iron in forms
which will react with water. Portland cement and similar materials are made by
heating limestone (a source of calcium) with clay or shale (a source of
silicon, aluminum and iron) and grinding this product (called clinker) with a
source of sulfate (most commonly gypsum).
In modern cement_kilns many advanced features are used to lower the fuel
consumption per ton of clinker produced. Cement kilns are extremely large,
complex, and inherently dusty industrial installations, and have emissions
which must be controlled. Of the various ingredients used to produce a given
quantity of concrete, the cement is the most energetically expensive. Even
complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce
a ton of clinker and then grind_it_into_cement. Many kilns can be fueled with
difficult-to-dispose-of wastes, the most common being used tires. The extremely
high temperatures and long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement
kilns to efficiently and completely burn even difficult-to-use fuels.[31]
**** Water[edit] ****
Combining water with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the
process of hydration. The cement paste glues the aggregate together, fills
voids within it, and makes it flow more freely.[32]
As stated by Abrams'_law, a lower water-to-cement ratio yields a stronger, more
durable concrete, whereas more water gives a freer-flowing concrete with a
higher slump.[33] Impure water used to make concrete can cause problems when
setting or in causing premature failure of the structure.[34]
Hydration involves many different reactions, often occurring at the same time.
As the reactions proceed, the products of the cement hydration process
gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other
components of the concrete to form a solid mass.[35]

      Balanced: 2Ca3SiO5 + 7H2O â 3(CaO)Â·2(SiO2)Â·4(H2O)(gel) + 3Ca(OH)2
      (approximately; the exact ratios of the CaO, SiO2 and H2O in C-S-H can
      vary)
**** Aggregates[edit] ****
Main article: Construction_aggregate
Crushed stone aggregate
Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. Sand,
natural gravel, and crushed_stone are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled
aggregates (from construction, demolition, and excavation waste) are
increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates, while a
number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled blast_furnace slag and
bottom_ash are also permitted.
The size distribution of the aggregate determines how much binder is required.
Aggregate with a very even size distribution has the biggest gaps whereas
adding aggregate with smaller particles tends to fill these gaps. The binder
must fill the gaps between the aggregate as well as paste the surfaces of the
aggregate together, and is typically the most expensive component. Thus,
variation in sizes of the aggregate reduces the cost of concrete.[36] The
aggregate is nearly always stronger than the binder, so its use does not
negatively affect the strength of the concrete.
Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates inhomogeneity due
to the influence of vibration. This can lead to strength gradients.[37]
Decorative stones such as quartzite, small river stones or crushed glass are
sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative "exposed aggregate"
finish, popular among landscape designers.
In addition to being decorative, exposed aggregate may add robustness to a
concrete.[38]
**** Reinforcement[edit] ****
Main article: Reinforced_concrete
Constructing a rebar cage that will be permanently embedded in a finished
reinforced_concrete structure
Concrete is strong in compression, as the aggregate efficiently carries the
compression load. However, it is weak in tension as the cement holding the
aggregate in place can crack, allowing the structure to fail. Reinforced
concrete adds either steel_reinforcing_bars, steel_fibers, glass fibers, or
plastic fibers to carry tensile_loads.
**** Admixtures[edit] ****
Admixtures are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the
concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete
mixes. Admixtures are defined as additions "made as the concrete mix is being
prepared".[39] The most common admixtures are retarders and accelerators. In
normal use, admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement and are added
to the concrete at the time of batching/mixing.[40] (See Â§ Production below.)
The common types of admixtures[41] are as follows:
    * Accelerators speed up the hydration (hardening) of the concrete. Typical
      materials used are calcium_chloride, calcium_nitrate and sodium_nitrate.
      However, use of chlorides may cause corrosion in steel reinforcing and is
      prohibited in some countries, so that nitrates may be favored, even
      though they are less effective than the chloride salt. Accelerating
      admixtures are especially useful for modifying the properties of concrete
      in cold weather.
    * Air_entraining_agents add and entrain tiny air bubbles in the concrete,
      which reduces damage during freeze-thaw cycles, increasing durability.
      However, entrained air entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of
      air may decrease compressive strength by 5%.[42] If too much air becomes
      trapped in the concrete as a result of the mixing process, Defoamers can
      be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface
      of the wet concrete and then disperse.
    * Bonding agents are used to create a bond between old and new concrete
      (typically a type of polymer) with wide temperature tolerance and
      corrosion resistance.
    * Corrosion_inhibitors are used to minimize the corrosion of steel and
      steel bars in concrete.
    * Crystalline admixtures are typically added during batching of the
      concrete to lower permeability. The reaction takes place when exposed to
      water and un-hydrated cement particles to form insoluble needle-shaped
      crystals, which fill capillary pores and micro-cracks in the concrete to
      block pathways for water and waterborne contaminates. Concrete with
      crystalline admixture can expect to self-seal as constant exposure to
      water will continuously initiate crystallization to ensure permanent
      waterproof protection.
    * Pigments can be used to change the color of concrete, for aesthetics.
    * Plasticizers increase the workability of plastic, or "fresh", concrete,
      allowing it to be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort. A
      typical plasticizer is lignosulfonate. Plasticizers can be used to reduce
      the water content of a concrete while maintaining workability and are
      sometimes called water-reducers due to this use. Such treatment improves
      its strength and durability]] characteristics.
    * Superplasticizers (also called high-range water-reducers) are a class of
      plasticizers that have fewer deleterious effects and can be used to
      increase workability more than is practical with traditional
      plasticizers. Superplasticizers are used to increase compressive
      strength. It increases the workability of the concrete and lowers the
      need for water content by 15â30%. Superplasticizers lead to retarding
      effects.
    * Pumping aids improve pumpability, thicken the paste and reduce separation
      and bleeding.
    * Retarders slow the hydration of concrete and are used in large or
      difficult pours where partial setting before the pour is complete is
      undesirable. Typical polyol retarders are sugar, sucrose, sodium
      gluconate, glucose, citric_acid, and tartaric_acid.

Inorganic materials that have pozzolanic or latent hydraulic properties, these
very fine-grained materials are added to the concrete mix to improve the
properties of concrete (mineral admixtures),[40] or as a replacement for
Portland cement (blended cements).[46] Products which incorporate limestone,
fly ash, blast furnace slag, and other useful materials with pozzolanic
properties into the mix, are being tested and used. This development is due to
cement production being one of the largest producers (at about 5 to 10%) of
global greenhouse gas emissions,[47] as well as lowering costs, improving
concrete properties, and recycling wastes.
    * Fly_ash: A by-product of coal-fired electric_generating_plants, it is
      used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass). The
      properties of fly ash depend on the type of coal burnt. In general,
      siliceous fly ash is pozzolanic, while calcareous fly ash has latent
      hydraulic properties.[48]
    * Ground_granulated_blast_furnace_slag (GGBFS or GGBS): A by-product of
      steel production is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to
      80% by mass). It has latent hydraulic properties.[49]
    * Silica_fume: A byproduct of the production of silicon and ferrosilicon
      alloys. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100
      times smaller. This results in a higher surface-to-volume ratio and a
      much faster pozzolanic reaction. Silica fume is used to increase strength
      and durability of concrete, but generally requires the use of
      superplasticizers for workability.[50]
    * High reactivity Metakaolin (HRM): Metakaolin produces concrete with
      strength and durability similar to concrete made with silica fume. While
      silica fume is usually dark gray or black in color, high-reactivity
      metakaolin is usually bright white in color, making it the preferred
      choice for architectural concrete where appearance is important.
    * Carbon nanofibers can be added to concrete to enhance compressive
      strength and gain a higher Youngâs_modulus, and also to improve the
      electrical properties required for strain monitoring, damage evaluation
      and self-health monitoring of concrete. Carbon fiber has many advantages
      in terms of mechanical and electrical properties (e.g., higher strength)
      and self-monitoring behavior due to the high tensile strength and high
      conductivity.[51]
    * Carbon products have been added to make concrete electrically conductive,
      for deicing purposes.[52]
***** Production[edit] *****

Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various
ingredientsâwater, aggregate, cement, and any additivesâto produce
concrete. Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are
mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern
usage, most concrete production takes place in a large type of industrial
facility called a concrete_plant, or often a batch plant.
In general usage, concrete plants come in two main types, ready mix plants and
central mix plants. A ready-mix plant mixes all the ingredients except water,
while a central mix plant mixes all the ingredients including water. A central-
mix plant offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better
measurements of the amount of water added, but must be placed closer to the
work site where the concrete will be used, since hydration begins at the plant.
A concrete plant consists of large storage hoppers for various reactive
ingredients like cement, storage for bulk ingredients like aggregate and water,
mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments, machinery to
accurately weigh, move, and mix some or all of those ingredients, and
facilities to dispense the mixed concrete, often to a concrete_mixer truck.
Modern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid, so that it may be
poured into forms, which are containers erected in the field to give the
concrete its desired shape. Concrete formwork can be prepared in several ways,
such as slip_forming and steel_plate_construction. Alternatively, concrete can
be mixed into dryer, non-fluid forms and used in factory settings to
manufacture precast_concrete products.
A wide variety of equipment is used for processing concrete, from hand tools to
heavy industrial machinery. Whichever equipment builders use, however, the
objective is to produce the desired building material; ingredients must be
properly mixed, placed, shaped, and retained within time constraints. Any
interruption in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to
begin to set before the next batch is added on top. This creates a horizontal
plane of weakness called a cold joint between the two batches.[53] Once the mix
is where it should be, the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the
concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various
technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product.
**** Mixing[edit] ****
See also: Volumetric_concrete_mixer and Concrete_mixer
Thorough mixing is essential to produce uniform, high-quality concrete.
Separate paste mixing has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a
paste before combining these materials with aggregates can increase the
compressive_strength of the resulting concrete.[54] The paste is generally
mixed in a high-speed, shear-type mixer at a w/cm (water to cement ratio) of
0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as
accelerators or retarders, superplasticizers, pigments, or silica_fume. The
premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water
and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.[55]
**** Workability[edit] ****
Main article: Concrete_slump_test

Pouring and smoothing out concrete at Palisades Park in Washington, DC
Workability is the ability of a fresh (plastic) concrete mix to fill the form/
mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the
concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and
size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration) and can
be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the
water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability.
Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation_of_aggregates (when
the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete
having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable
gradation[56] can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump,
which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of
water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too
large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate
grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little
or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much
cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate
such as pebbles. Any combination of these factors and others may result in a
mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is
difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.
[57]
Workability can be measured by the concrete_slump_test, a simple measure of the
plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the ASTM C 143 or EN 12350-
2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an "Abrams_cone" with a
sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end
down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of
equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the
layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a
certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little,
having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50 mm) out of one foot
(305 mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches.
Workability can also be measured by the flow_table_test.
Slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer
or superplasticizer without changing the water-cement_ratio.[58] Some other
admixtures, especially air-entraining admixture, can increase the slump of a
mix.
High-flow concrete, like self-consolidating_concrete, is tested by other flow-
measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow
end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually
lifted.
After mixing, concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where
needed.
**** Curing[edit] ****
A concrete slab being kept hydrated during water curing by submersion (ponding)
Concrete must be kept moist during curing in order to achieve optimal strength
and durability.[59] During curing hydration occurs, allowing calcium-silicate
hydrate (C-S-H) to form. Over 90% of a mix's final strength is typically
reached within four weeks, with the remaining 10% achieved over years or even
decades.[60] The conversion of calcium_hydroxide in the concrete into calcium
carbonate from absorption of CO2 over several decades further strengthens the
concrete and makes it more resistant to damage. This carbonation reaction,
however, lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can corrode the
reinforcement bars.
Hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical.
Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from
wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it
has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage
cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept
damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes
cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by
increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of
concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section
dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.[61] Addition of
short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during
curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.[62]
Properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and
avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be
taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the exothermic setting of cement.
Improper curing can cause scaling, reduced strength, poor abrasion resistance
and cracking.
*** Techniques[edit] ***
During the curing period, concrete is ideally maintained at controlled
temperature and humidity. To ensure full hydration during curing, concrete
slabs are often sprayed with "curing compounds" that create a water-retaining
film over the concrete. Typical films are made of wax or related hydrophobic
compounds. After the concrete is sufficiently cured, the film is allowed to
abrade from the concrete through normal use.[63]
Traditional conditions for curing involve by spraying or ponding the concrete
surface with water. The adjacent picture shows one of many ways to achieve
this, pondingâsubmerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to
prevent dehydration. Additional common curing methods include wet burlap and
plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete.
For higher-strength applications, accelerated_curing techniques may be applied
to the concrete. A common technique involves heating the poured concrete with
steam, which serves to both keep it damp and raise the temperature, so that the
hydration process proceeds more quickly and more thoroughly.
***** Specialty types[edit] *****
Main article: Types_of_concrete
**** Pervious[edit] ****
Main article: Pervious_concrete
Pervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate, cement, water
and little-to-no fine aggregates. This concrete is also known as "no-fines" or
porous concrete. Mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process
creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles. The hardened
concrete contains interconnected air voids totaling approximately 15 to 25
percent. Water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath.
Air entrainment admixtures are often used in freezeâthaw climates to minimize
the possibility of frost damage.
**** Nanoconcrete[edit] ****
Decorative plate made of Nano concrete with High-Energy Mixing (HEM)
Two-layered pavers, pigmented top layer made of HEM nanoconcrete
Nanoconcrete contains Portland cement particles that are no greater than 100
Î¼m.[64] It is a product of high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water.
To ensure the mixing is thorough enough to create nanoconcrete, the mixer must
apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30â600 watts per kilogram of the
mix. This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific_energy
expended upon the mix of at least 5000 joules per kilogram of the mix.[65]
[irrelevant_citation] and may be increased to 30â80 kJ per kilogram. A
superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be
mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete_mixer. In the HEM process, the
intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation and
absorption of energy by the mixture and increases shear stresses on the surface
of cement particles. As a result, the temperature of the mixture increases by
20â25 degrees Celsius. This intense mixing serves to deepen hydration process
inside the cement particles. The nano-sized colloid Calcium_Silicate_Hydrate
(C-S-H) formation increased several times compared with conventional mixing.
Thus, the ordinary concrete transforms to nanoconcrete. The initial natural
process of cement hydration with formation of colloidal globules about 5 nm in
diameter[66] spreads into the entire volume of cementâwater matrix as the
energy expended upon the mix.[67] The liquid activated high-energy mixture can
be used by itself for casting small architectural details and decorative items,
or foamed (expanded) for lightweight_concrete. HEM Nanoconcrete hardens in low
and subzero temperature conditions because the liquid phase inside the nano-
pores of C-S-H gel doesn't freeze at temperatures from −8 to −42 degrees
Celsius.[68] The increased volume of gel reduces capillarity in solid and
porous materials.
**** Microbial[edit] ****
Bacteria such as Bacillus_pasteurii, Bacillus_pseudofirmus, Bacillus cohnii,
Sporosarcina pasteuri, and Arthrobacter_crystallopoietes increase the
compression strength of concrete through their biomass. Not all bacteria
increase the strength of concrete significantly with their biomass.[69]:143
Bacillus sp. CT-5. can reduce corrosion of reinforcement in reinforced concrete
by up to four times. Sporosarcina pasteurii reduces water and chloride
permeability. B. pasteurii increases resistance to acid.[69]:146 Bacillus
pasteurii and B. sphaericuscan induce calcium carbonate precipitation in the
surface of cracks, adding compression strength.[69]:147
**** Polymer[edit] ****
Main article: Polymer_concrete
Polymer concretes are mixtures of aggregate and any of various polymers and may
be reinforced. The cement is costlier than lime-based cements, but polymer
concretes nevertheless have advantages; they have significant tensile strength
even without reinforcement, and they are largely impervious to water. Polymer
concretes are frequently used for repair and construction of other
applications, such as drains.
***** Safety[edit] *****
Grinding of concrete can produce hazardous_dust. Exposure to cement dust can
lead to issues such as silicosis, kidney disease, skin irritation and similar
effects. The U.S. National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health in the
United States recommends attaching local exhaust ventilation shrouds to
electric concrete grinders to control the spread of this dust.[70] In addition,
the Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration (OSHA) has placed more
stringent regulations on companies whose workers regularly come into contact
with silica dust. An updated silica rule,[71] which OSHA put into effect 23
Sept. 2017 for construction companies, restricted the amount of respirable
crystalline silica workers could legally come into contact with to 50
micrograms per cubic meter of air per 8-hour workday. That same rule went into
effect 23 June 2018 for general industry, hydraulic fracturing and maritime. It
should be noted, however, that the deadline was extended to 23 June 2021 for
engineering controls in the hydraulic fracturing industry. Companies which fail
to meet the tightened safety regulations can face financial charges and
extensive penalties.
***** Properties[edit] *****
Main article: Properties_of_concrete
Concrete has relatively high compressive_strength, but much lower tensile
strength.[72] Therefore, it is usually reinforced with materials that are
strong in tension (often steel). The elasticity of concrete is relatively
constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as
matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low coefficient_of_thermal
expansion and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures crack to some
extent, due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long-
duration forces is prone to creep.
Tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to
specifications for the application.
Compression testing of a concrete cylinder
Different mixes of concrete ingredients produce different strengths. Concrete
strength values are usually specified as the lower-bound compressive strength
of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen as determined by standard test
procedures.
Different strengths of concrete are used for different purposes. Very low-
strengthâ14 MPa (2,000 psi) or lessâconcrete may be used when the concrete
must be lightweight.[73] Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air,
foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is
reduced. For most routine uses, 20 MPa (2,900 psi) to 32 MPa (4,600 psi)
concrete is often used. 40 MPa (5,800 psi) concrete is readily commercially
available as a more durable, although more expensive, option. Higher-strength
concrete is often used for larger civil projects.[74] Strengths above 40 MPa
(5,800 psi) are often used for specific building elements. For example, the
lower floor columns of high-rise concrete buildings may use concrete of 80 MPa
(11,600 psi) or more, to keep the size of the columns small. Bridges may use
long beams of high-strength concrete to lower the number of spans required.[75]
[76] Occasionally, other structural needs may require high-strength concrete.
If a structure must be very rigid, concrete of very high strength may be
specified, even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads.
Strengths as high as 130 MPa (18,900 psi) have been used commercially for these
reasons.[75]
***** In construction[edit] *****
The City_Court_Building in Buffalo,_New_York
Concrete is one of the most durable building materials. It provides superior
fire resistance compared with wooden construction and gains strength over time.
Structures made of concrete can have a long service life. Concrete is used more
than any other artificial material in the world.[77] As of 2006, about 7.5
billion cubic meters of concrete are made each year, more than one cubic meter
for every person on Earth.[78]
**** Mass structures[edit] ****
Main article: Mass_concrete
Aerial photo of reconstruction at Taum_Sauk (Missouri) pumped storage facility
in late November 2009. After the original reservoir failed, the new reservoir
was made of roller-compacted concrete.
Due to cement's exothermic chemical reaction while setting up, large concrete
structures such as dams, navigation_locks, large mat foundations, and large
breakwaters generate excessive heat during hydration and associated expansion.
To mitigate these effects, post-cooling[79] is commonly applied during
construction. An early example at Hoover Dam used a network of pipes between
vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing
process to avoid damaging overheating. Similar systems are still used;
depending on volume of the pour, the concrete mix used, and ambient air
temperature, the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is
placed. Various methods also are used to pre-cool the concrete mix in mass
concrete structures.[79]
Another approach to mass concrete structures that minimizes cement's thermal
byproduct is the use of roller-compacted_concrete, which uses a dry mix which
has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional wet placement. It is
deposited in thick layers as a semi-dry material then roller compacted into a
dense, strong mass.
**** Surface finishes[edit] ****
Main article: Decorative_concrete
Advantage_and_Disadvantage_of_Concrete
Black basalt polished concrete floor
Raw concrete surfaces tend to be porous and have a relatively uninteresting
appearance. Many different finishes can be applied to improve the appearance
and preserve the surface against staining, water penetration, and freezing.
Examples of improved appearance include stamped_concrete where the wet concrete
has a pattern impressed on the surface, to give a paved, cobbled or brick-like
effect, and may be accompanied with coloration. Another popular effect for
flooring and table tops is polished_concrete where the concrete is polished
optically flat with diamond abrasives and sealed with polymers or other
sealants.
Other finishes can be achieved with chiseling, or more conventional techniques
such as painting or covering it with other materials.
The proper treatment of the surface of concrete, and therefore its
characteristics, is an important stage in the construction and renovation of
architectural structures.[80]
**** Prestressed structures[edit] ****
Main article: Prestressed_concrete
Stylized cacti decorate a sound/retaining wall in Scottsdale,_Arizona
Prestressed_concrete is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in
compressive_stresses during construction to oppose tensile stresses experienced
in use. This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs, by better
distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the
reinforcement. For example, a horizontal beam tends to sag. Prestressed
reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this. In pre-tensioned
concrete, the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or
bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-
tensioned concrete, after casting.
More than 55,000 miles (89,000 km) of highways in the United States are paved
with this material. Reinforced_concrete, prestressed_concrete and precast
concrete are the most widely used types_of_concrete functional extensions in
modern days. See Brutalism.
**** Cold weather placement[edit] ****
Extreme_weather conditions (extreme heat or cold; windy condition, and humidity
variations) can significantly alter the quality of concrete. Many precautions
are observed in cold weather placement.[81] Low temperatures significantly slow
the chemical reactions involved in hydration of cement, thus affecting the
strength development. Preventing freezing is the most important precaution, as
formation of ice crystals can cause damage to the crystalline structure of the
hydrated cement paste. If the surface of the concrete pour is insulated from
the outside temperatures, the heat of hydration will prevent freezing.
The American_Concrete_Institute (ACI) definition of cold weather placement, ACI
306,[82] is:
    * A period when for more than three successive days the average daily air
      temperature drops below 40 ËF (~ 4.5 Â°C), and
    * Temperature stays below 50 ËF (10 Â°C) for more than one-half of any 24-
      hour period.
In Canada, where temperatures tend to be much lower during the cold season, the
following criteria are used by CSA A23.1:
    * When the air temperature is â¤ 5 Â°C, and
    * When there is a probability that the temperature may fall below 5 Â°C
      within 24 hours of placing the concrete.
The minimum strength before exposing concrete to extreme cold is 500 psi (3.5
MPa). CSA A 23.1 specified a compressive strength of 7.0 MPa to be considered
safe for exposure to freezing.
**** Roads[edit] ****
Concrete_roads are more fuel efficient to drive on,[83] more reflective and
last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, yet have a much smaller
market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design
practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-
designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs
and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is
that pervious_concrete can be used, which eliminates the need to place storm
drains near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help
rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of
drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise
needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it
no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the
ground.
**** Energy efficiency[edit] ****
Energy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is
produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100
kilometers of the job site. Similarly, relatively little energy is used in
producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO2 are
produced by the chemical reactions in cement_manufacture).[84] The overall
embodied_energy of concrete at roughly 1 to 1.5 megajoules per kilogram is
therefore lower than for most structural and construction materials.[85]
Once in place, concrete offers great energy efficiency over the lifetime of a
building.[86] Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames.
[87] Air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home.
The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both
residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy
needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round
benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and
cooling costs.[88] While insulation reduces energy loss through the building
envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete
wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-
efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or
panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the
shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to
create the structure.
**** Fire safety[edit] ****
Boston_City_Hall (1968) is a Brutalist design constructed largely of precast
and poured in place concrete. It was voted "The World's Ugliest Building" in
2008
Concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using
steel frames, since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can
thus last longer under the same fire conditions. Concrete is sometimes used as
a fire protection for steel frames, for the same effect as above. Concrete as a
fire shield, for example Fondu_fyre, can also be used in extreme environments
like a missile launch pad.
Options for non-combustible construction include floors, ceilings and roofs
made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete
masonry technology and Insulating_Concrete_Forms (ICFs) are additional options.
ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are
stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with
reinforced concrete to create the structure.
Concrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such
as high winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness, which
results in minimal horizontal movement. However, this stiffness can work
against certain types of concrete structures, particularly where a relatively
higher flexing structure is required to resist more extreme forces.
**** Earthquake safety[edit] ****
As discussed above, concrete is very strong in compression, but weak in
tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures.
These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional
loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced
masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced
masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally.[89]
These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings,
(e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey[90]).
***** Degradation[edit] *****
Main article: Concrete_degradation
Concrete spalling caused by the corrosion of rebar
Concrete can be damaged by many processes, such as the expansion of corrosion
products of the steel reinforcement_bars, freezing of trapped water, fire or
radiant heat, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion,
leaching, erosion by fast-flowing water, physical damage and chemical damage
(from carbonatation, chlorides, sulfates and distillate water).[91] The micro
fungi Aspergillus Alternaria and Cladosporium were able to grow on samples of
concrete used as a radioactive waste barrier in the Chernobyl reactor; leaching
aluminum, iron, calcium, and silicon.[92]
The Tunkhannock_Viaduct in northeastern Pennsylvania opened in 1912 and is
still in regular use today
***** Environmental and health[edit] *****
Main article: Environmental_impact_of_concrete
The manufacture and use of concrete produce a wide range of environmental and
social consequences. Some are harmful, some welcome, and some both, depending
on circumstances.
A major component of concrete is cement, which similarly exerts environmental
and_social_effects.[69]:142 The cement industry is one of the three primary
producers of carbon_dioxide, a major greenhouse_gas (the other two being the
energy production and transportation industries). Every tonne of cement
produced releases one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere.[93] As of 2019, the
production of Portland cement contributed eight percent to global anthropogenic
CO2 emissions, largely due to the sintering of limestone and clay at 1,500 Â°C
(2,730 Â°F).[93][94] Researchers have suggested a number of approaches to
improving carbon sequestration relevant to concrete production.[95]
Concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to surface_runoff,
which can cause heavy soil erosion, water pollution, and flooding, but
conversely can be used to divert, dam, and control flooding. Concrete dust
released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of
dangerous air pollution.
Concrete is a contributor to the urban_heat_island effect, though less so than
asphalt.[96]
Workers who cut, grind or polish concrete are at risk of inhaling airborne
silica, which can lead to silicosis.[97] This includes crew members who work in
concrete_chipping. The presence of some substances in concrete, including
useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns due to toxicity and
radioactivity. Fresh concrete (before curing is complete) is highly alkaline
and must be handled with proper protective equipment.
Recycled crushed concrete, to be reused as granular fill, is loaded into a
semi-dump truck
**** Recycling[edit] ****
Main article: Concrete_recycling
Concrete recycling is an increasingly common method for disposing of concrete
structures. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to landfills for
disposal, but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness,
governmental laws and economic benefits.
***** World records[edit] *****
The world record for the largest concrete pour in a single project is the Three
Gorges_Dam in Hubei Province, China by the Three Gorges Corporation. The amount
of concrete used in the construction of the dam is estimated at 16 million
cubic meters over 17 years. The previous record was 12.3 million cubic meters
held by Itaipu_hydropower_station in Brazil.[98][99][99][100]
The world record for concrete pumping was set on 7 August 2009 during the
construction of the Parbati Hydroelectric Project, near the village of Suind,
Himachal_Pradesh, India, when the concrete mix was pumped through a vertical
height of 715 m (2,346 ft).[101][102]
The world record for the largest continuously poured concrete raft was achieved
in August 2007 in Abu Dhabi by contracting firm Al Habtoor-CCC Joint Venture
and the concrete supplier is Unibeton Ready Mix.[103][104] The pour (a part of
the foundation for the Abu Dhabi's Landmark_Tower) was 16,000 cubic meters of
concrete poured within a two-day period.[105] The previous record, 13,200 cubic
meters poured in 54 hours despite a severe tropical storm requiring the site to
be covered with tarpaulins to allow work to continue, was achieved in 1992 by
joint Japanese and South Korean consortiums Hazama_Corporation and the Samsung
C&T_Corporation for the construction of the Petronas_Towers in Kuala_Lumpur,
Malaysia.[106]
The world record for largest continuously poured concrete floor was completed 8
November 1997, in Louisville, Kentucky by design-build firm EXXCEL Project
Management. The monolithic placement consisted of 225,000 square feet
(20,900 m2) of concrete placed in 30 hours, finished to a flatness tolerance of
FF 54.60 and a levelness tolerance of FL 43.83. This surpassed the previous
record by 50% in total volume and 7.5% in total area.[107][108]
The record for the largest continuously placed underwater concrete pour was
completed 18 October 2010, in New Orleans, Louisiana by contractor C. J. Mahan
Construction Company, LLC of Grove City, Ohio. The placement consisted of
10,251 cubic yards of concrete placed in 58.5 hours using two concrete pumps
and two dedicated concrete batch plants. Upon curing, this placement allows the
50,180-square-foot (4,662 m2) cofferdam to be dewatered approximately 26 feet
(7.9 m) below sea level to allow the construction of the Inner_Harbor
Navigation_Canal Sill & Monolith Project to be completed in the dry.[109]
