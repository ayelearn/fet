"First Law" is a science_fiction short_story by American writer Isaac_Asimov,
first published in the October 1956 issue of Fantastic_Universe magazine and
later collected in The_Rest_of_the_Robots (1964) and The_Complete_Robot (1982).
[1] The title of the story is a reference to the first of the Three_Laws_of
Robotics.
***** Background[edit] *****
In 1941 John_W._Campbell of Astounding_Science_Fiction began a new department,
"Probability Zero", for very short stories. He hoped to publish new writers,
but wanted experienced authors early on, including Isaac_Asimov. To Asimov's
surprise, Campbell rejected "Big_Game" and "First Law" in November and December
1941. Having learned that a rejected story might sell elsewhere, he saved
"First Law" until it was published by Fantastic_Universe in October 1956.[2]
***** Plot summary[edit] *****
The story is very short, only three pages in length, and takes the form of Mike
Donovan's account of an incident that occurred on Titan, one of Saturn's moons.
He tells of a malfunctioning robot named Emma that escaped from the base and
was later encountered by Donovan while he was lost during a storm. While
Donovan's life was in danger, Emma chose to protect its offspring, a small
robot that it had built, instead of assisting him. This was a direct violation
of the First Law of Robotics, which states that "a robot may not injure a human
being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm". Apparently,
maternal instincts in the robot took precedence over its programming, an
example of the commonly encountered literary theme of paternalism in Asimov's
work.
While such direct disobedience of the First Law is not described in any other
robot story by Asimov, he points out that the story is told by Donovan, who may
be an unreliable_narrator.[3] Asimov admits that "I was being funny at the
expense of my robots".[3] In The Complete Robot, he also points out that this
story is intended as a parody and is not to be taken seriously.[4]
