Electrical engineering is a technical discipline concerned with the study,
design and application of equipment, devices and systems which use electricity,
electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identified activity in the
latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric
telegraph, the telephone, and electrical_power generation, distribution and
use.
Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of fields including,
computer_engineering, power_engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency
engineering, signal_processing, instrumentation, and electronics. Many of these
disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of
specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics,
electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology,
electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, and electrical materials
science. See glossary_of_electrical_and_electronics_engineering.
Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering or
electronic engineering. Practising engineers may have professional
certification and be members of a professional_body or an international
standards organization. These include the International_Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC), the Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers (IEEE)
and the Institution_of_Engineering_and_Technology (IET) (formerly the IEE). The
IEC prepares international standards for electrical engineering, developed
through consensus, thanks to the work of 20,000 electrotechnical experts,
coming from 172 countries worldwide.
Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills
required are likewise variable. These range from circuit_theory to the
management skills of a project_manager. The tools and equipment that an
individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple
voltmeter to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing
software. [2]

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_electrical_engineering
Electricity has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early
17th_century. William_Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist, and
was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static
electricity. He is credited with establishing the term "electricity".[3] He
also designed the versorium: a device that detects the presence of statically
charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor Johan_Wilcke invented a device later
named electrophorus that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 Alessandro
Volta had developed the voltaic_pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.
**** 19th century[edit] ****
The discoveries of Michael_Faraday formed the foundation of electric motor
technology
In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable
developments in this century include the work of Hans_Christian_Ãrsted who
discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will
deflect a compass needle, of William_Sturgeon who, in 1825 invented the
electromagnet, of Joseph_Henry and Edward_Davy who invented the electrical
relay in 1835, of Georg_Ohm, who in 1827 quantified the relationship between
the electric_current and potential_difference in a conductor,[4] of Michael
Faraday (the discoverer of electromagnetic_induction in 1831), and of James
Clerk_Maxwell, who in 1873 published a unified theory of electricity and
magnetism in his treatise Electricity and Magnetism.[5]
In 1782 Georges-Louis_Le_Sage developed and presented in Berlin probably the
world's first form of electric telegraphy, using 24 different wires, one for
each letter of the alphabet. This telegraph connected two rooms. It was an
electrostatic telegraph that moved gold leafs through electrical conduction.
In 1795, Francisco_Salva_Campillo proposed an electrostatic telegraph system.
Between 1803-1804, he worked on electrical telegraphy and in 1804, he presented
his report at the Royal Academy of Natural Sciences and Arts of Barcelona.
Salvaâs electrolyte telegraph system was very innovative though it was
greatly influenced by and based upon two new discoveries made in Europe in 1800
â Alessandro Voltaâs electric battery for generating an electric current
and William Nicholson and Anthony Carlyleâs electrolysis of water.[6]
Electrical_telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical
engineering. Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th
century. Practitioners had created a global electric_telegraph network and the
first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK
and USA to support the new discipline. Francis_Ronalds created an electric
telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be
transformed by electricity.[7][8] Over 50 years later, he joined the new
Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution_of
Electrical_Engineers) where he was regarded by other members as the first of
their cohort.[9] By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever
changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development
of land-lines, submarine_cables, and, from about 1890, wireless_telegraphy.
Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need
for standardised units_of_measure. They led to the international
standardization of the units volt, ampere, coulomb, ohm, farad, and henry. This
was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.[10] The
publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in
standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions
were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.[11]
During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a
subfield of physics since the early electrical technology was considered
electromechanical in nature. The Technische_UniversitÃ¤t_Darmstadt founded the
world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882. The first
electrical engineering degree program was started at Massachusetts_Institute_of
Technology (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, [12]
though it was Cornell_University to produce the world's first electrical
engineering graduates in 1885.[13] The first course in electrical engineering
was taught in 1883 in Cornellâs Sibley_College_of_Mechanical_Engineering_and
Mechanic_Arts.[14] It was not until about 1885 that Cornell President Andrew
Dickson_White established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the
United States.[15] In the same year, University_College_London founded the
first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain.[16] Professor Mendell
P. Weinbach at University_of_Missouri soon followed suit by establishing the
electrical engineering department in 1886.[17] Afterwards, universities and
institutes_of_technology gradually started to offer electrical engineering
programs to their students all over the world.
    * Thomas_Edison, electric light and (DC) power supply networks
    * KÃ¡roly_Zipernowsky, OttÃ³_BlÃ¡thy, Miksa_DÃ©ri, the ZBD transformer
    * William_Stanley,_Jr., transformers
    * Galileo_Ferraris, electrical theory, induction motor
    * Nikola_Tesla, practical polyphase (AC) and induction motor designs
    * Mikhail_Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed standard 3-phase (AC) systems
    * Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz, AC mathematical theories for engineers
    * Oliver_Heaviside, developed theoretical models for electric circuits
During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In
1882, Thomas_Edison switched on the world's first large-scale electric power
network that provided 110 volts â direct_current (DC) â to 59 customers on
Manhattan_Island in New_York_City. In 1884, Sir_Charles_Parsons invented the
steam_turbine allowing for more efficient electric power generation.
Alternating_current, with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over
long distances via the use of transformers, developed rapidly in the 1880s and
1890s with transformer designs by KÃ¡roly_Zipernowsky, OttÃ³_BlÃ¡thy and Miksa
DÃ©ri (later called ZBD transformers), Lucien_Gaulard, John_Dixon_Gibbs and
William_Stanley,_Jr.. Practical AC_motor designs including induction_motors
were independently invented by Galileo_Ferraris and Nikola_Tesla and further
developed into a practical three-phase form by Mikhail_Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and
Charles_Eugene_Lancelot_Brown.[18] Charles_Steinmetz and Oliver_Heaviside
contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering.[19]
[20] The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been
called the War_of_Currents between a George_Westinghouse backed AC system and a
Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall
standard.[21]
**** Modern developments[edit] ****
Guglielmo_Marconi known for his pioneering work on long distance radio
transmission
During the development_of_radio, many scientists and inventors contributed to
radio_technology and electronics. The mathematical work of James_Clerk_Maxwell
during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of
electromagnetic_radiation including possibility of invisible airborne waves
(later called "radio waves"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888,
Heinrich_Hertz proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting radio_waves with a
spark-gap_transmitter, and detected them by using simple electrical devices.
Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed
devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, Guglielmo_Marconi began
work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these
"Hertzian waves" into a purpose built commercial wireless_telegraphic system.
Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In
December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature
of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the
Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of
2,100 miles (3,400 km).[22]
In 1897, Karl_Ferdinand_Braun introduced the cathode_ray_tube as part of an
oscilloscope, a crucial enabling technology for electronic_television.[23] John
Fleming invented the first radio tube, the diode, in 1904. Two years later,
Robert_von_Lieben and Lee_De_Forest independently developed the amplifier tube,
called the triode.[24]
In 1920, Albert_Hull developed the magnetron which would eventually lead to the
development of the microwave_oven in 1946 by Percy_Spencer.[25][26] In 1934,
the British military began to make strides toward radar (which also uses the
magnetron) under the direction of Dr Wimperis, culminating in the operation of
the first radar station at Bawdsey in August 1936.[27]
In 1941, Konrad_Zuse presented the Z3, the world's first fully functional and
programmable computer using electromechanical parts. In 1943, Tommy_Flowers
designed and built the Colossus, the world's first fully functional,
electronic, digital and programmable computer.[28] In 1946, the ENIAC
(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of John_Presper_Eckert and John
Mauchly followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of
these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and
achieve new objectives, including the Apollo_program which culminated in
landing_astronauts_on_the_Moon.[29]
**** Solid-state electronics[edit] ****
A replica of the first working transistor.
The invention of the transistor in late 1947 by William_Shockley, John_Bardeen,
and Walter_Brattain of the Bell_Telephone_Laboratories opened the door for more
compact devices and led to the development of the integrated_circuit in 1958 by
Jack_Kilby and independently in 1959 by Robert_Noyce.[30]
The microprocessor was introduced with the Intel_4004. It began with the
"Busicom Project"[31] as Masatoshi_Shima's three-chip CPU design in 1968,[32]
[31] before Sharp's Tadashi_Sasaki conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which
he discussed with Busicom and Intel in 1968.[33] The Intel 4004 was then
developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's
Marcian_Hoff and Federico_Faggin and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.[31] The
microprocessor led to the development of microcomputers and personal_computers,
and the microcomputer_revolution.
***** Subfields[edit] *****
Electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are
listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on
one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes
certain fields, such as electronic engineering and computer_engineering, are
considered separate disciplines in their own right.
**** Power[edit] ****
Main article: Power_engineering
Power_pole
Power engineering deals with the generation, transmission, and distribution of
electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices.[34] These
include transformers, electric_generators, electric_motors, high voltage
engineering, and power_electronics. In many regions of the world, governments
maintain an electrical network called a power_grid that connects a variety of
generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical
energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their
own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid
as well as the power systems that connect to it.[35] Such systems are called
on-grid power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power
from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not
connect to the grid, called off-grid power systems, which in some cases are
preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power
systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent
blackouts.
**** Control[edit] ****
Main articles: Control_engineering, Automatic_control, and Control_theory
Control_systems play a critical role in spaceflight.
Control_engineering focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic
systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave
in the desired manner.[36] To implement such controllers, electrical engineers
may use electronic_circuits, digital_signal_processors, microcontrollers, and
programmable_logic_controllers (PLCs). Control_engineering has a wide range of
applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial_airliners to
the cruise_control present in many modern automobiles.[37] It also plays an
important role in industrial_automation.
Control engineers often utilize feedback when designing control_systems. For
example, in an automobile with cruise_control the vehicle's speed is
continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor's
power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, control_theory can
be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.[38]
**** Electronics[edit] ****
Main article: Electronic_engineering
Electronic_components
Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of electronic_circuits
that use the properties of components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors,
diodes, and transistors to achieve a particular functionality.[35] The tuned
circuit, which allows the user of a radio to filter out all but a single
station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is
a pneumatic signal conditioner.
Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as radio
engineering and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and
radar, commercial_radio, and early_television.[35] Later, in post war years, as
consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern
television, audio systems, computers, and microprocessors. In the mid-to-late
1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name electronic
engineering.
Before the invention of the integrated_circuit in 1959,[39] electronic circuits
were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans.
These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in
speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast,
integrated_circuits packed a large numberâoften millionsâof tiny electrical
components, mainly transistors,[40] into a small chip around the size of a
coin. This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices we
see today.
**** Microelectronics and nanoelectronics[edit] ****
Main articles: Microelectronics and Nanoelectronics
Microprocessor
Microelectronics engineering deals with the design and microfabrication of very
small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated_circuit or
sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component.[41] The most
common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all
main electronic components (resistors, capacitors etc.) can be created at a
microscopic level.
Nanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels.
Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100 nm
processing having been standard since around 2002.[42]
Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of
semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, compound_semiconductors
like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of
electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics
involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires
the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working
knowledge of the effects of quantum_mechanics.[43]
**** Signal processing[edit] ****
Main article: Signal_processing
A Bayer_filter on a CCD requires signal processing to get a red, green, and
blue value at each pixel.
Signal_processing deals with the analysis and manipulation of signals.[44]
Signals can be either analog, in which case the signal varies continuously
according to the information, or digital, in which case the signal varies
according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For
analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering
of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of
signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may
involve the compression, error_detection and error_correction of digitally
sampled signals.[45]
Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming
the core of digital_signal_processing and it is rapidly expanding with new
applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications,
control, radar, audio_engineering, broadcast_engineering, power electronics,
and biomedical_engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced
with their digital counterparts. Analog_signal_processing is still important in
the design of many control_systems.
DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as
digital television_sets,[46] radios, Hi-Fi audio equipment, mobile phones,
multimedia_players, camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems,
noise_cancelling headphones, digital spectrum_analyzers, missile guidance
systems, radar systems, and telematics systems. In such products, DSP may be
responsible for noise_reduction, speech_recognition or synthesis, encoding_or
decoding digital media, wirelessly transmitting_or_receiving data,
triangulating position using GPS, and other kinds of image_processing, video
processing, audio_processing, and speech_processing.[47]
**** Telecommunications[edit] ****
Main article: Telecommunications_engineering
Satellite_dishes are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite
information.
Telecommunications_engineering focuses on the transmission of information
across a communication_channel such as a coax_cable, optical_fiber or free
space.[48] Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in
a carrier_signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for
transmission; this is known as modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques
include amplitude_modulation and frequency_modulation.[49] The choice of
modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors
must be balanced carefully by the engineer.
Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined,
telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for
such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication
device known as a transceiver. A key consideration in the design of
transmitters is their power_consumption as this is closely related to their
signal_strength.[50][51] Typically, if the power of the transmitted signal is
insufficient once the signal arrives at the receiver's antenna(s), the
information contained in the signal will be corrupted by noise.
**** Instrumentation[edit] ****
Main article: Instrumentation_engineering
Flight_instruments provide pilots with the tools to control aircraft
analytically.
Instrumentation_engineering deals with the design of devices to measure
physical quantities such as pressure, flow, and temperature.[52] The design of
such instruments requires a good understanding of physics that often extends
beyond electromagnetic_theory. For example, flight_instruments measure
variables such as wind_speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of
aircraft analytically. Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier-Seebeck_effect
to measure the temperature difference between two points.[53]
Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the sensors of
larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help
ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant.[54] For this reason,
instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.
**** Computers[edit] ****
Main article: Computer_engineering
Supercomputers are used in fields as diverse as computational_biology and
geographic_information_systems.
Computer engineering deals with the design of computers and computer_systems.
This may involve the design of new hardware, the design of PDAs, tablets, and
supercomputers, or the use of computers to control an industrial_plant.[55]
Computer engineers may also work on a system's software. However, the design of
complex software systems is often the domain of software_engineering, which is
usually considered a separate discipline.[56] Desktop_computers represent a
tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-
like architectures are now found in a range of devices including video_game
consoles and DVD_players.
***** Related disciplines[edit] *****
The Bird VIP Infant ventilator
Mechatronics is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of
electrical and mechanical systems. Such combined systems are known as
electromechanical systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include
automated_manufacturing_systems,[57] heating,_ventilation_and_air-conditioning
systems,[58] and various subsystems of aircraft and automobiles. [59]
Electronic systems design is the subject within electrical engineering that
deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and
mechanical systems.[60]
The term mechatronics is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems but
futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices.
Already, such small devices, known as Microelectromechanical_systems (MEMS),
are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy,[61] in digital
projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet_printers to create nozzles
for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help
build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical_communication.[62]
Biomedical_engineering is another related discipline, concerned with the design
of medical_equipment. This includes fixed equipment such as ventilators, MRI
scanners,[63] and electrocardiograph_monitors as well as mobile equipment such
as cochlear_implants, artificial_pacemakers, and artificial_hearts.
Aerospace_engineering and robotics an example is the most recent electric
propulsion and ion propulsion.
***** Education[edit] *****
Main article: Education_and_training_of_electrical_and_electronics_engineers
Oscilloscope
Electrical engineers typically possess an academic_degree with a major in
electrical engineering, electronics_engineering, electrical_engineering
technology,[64] or electrical and electronic engineering.[65][66] The same
fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary
according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or
five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science
in Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, Bachelor_of_Engineering,
Bachelor_of_Science, Bachelor_of_Technology, or Bachelor_of_Applied_Science
depending on the university. The bachelor's_degree generally includes units
covering physics, mathematics, computer_science, project_management, and a
variety_of_topics_in_electrical_engineering.[67] Initially such topics cover
most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some
schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines
towards the end of their courses of study.
An example circuit_diagram. It is used as a powerful tool in troubleshooting.
At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical
award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and
Electronic), but in others electrical and electronic engineering are both
considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are
offered.[68]
Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a
Master_of_Engineering/Master_of_Science (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of Engineering
Management, a Doctor_of_Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an Engineering
Doctorate (Eng.D.), or an Engineer's_degree. The master's and engineer's
degrees may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The
Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant
research component and are often viewed as the entry point to academia. In the
United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is
often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than
the Bachelor of Engineering rather than postgraduate.[69]
***** Professional practice[edit] *****

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step
towards professional_certification and the degree program itself is certified
by a professional_body.[70] After completing a certified degree program the
engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience
requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated
the title of Professional_Engineer (in the United States, Canada and South
Africa), Chartered_Engineer or Incorporated_Engineer (in India, Pakistan, the
United Kingdom, Ireland and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in
Australia and New Zealand) or European_Engineer (in much of the European
Union).
The IEEE corporate office is on the 17th floor of 3_Park_Avenue in New_York
City
The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the
United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work
for public and private clients".[71] This requirement is enforced by state and
provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act.[72] In other countries,
no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code
of_ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.[73] In
this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical
standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has
little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract_law. In
cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort_of
negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal_negligence. An
engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations,
such as building_codes and legislation pertaining to environmental_law.
Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the Institute_of
Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution_of_Engineering
and_Technology (IET). The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature
in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over
3,000 conferences annually.[74] The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide
membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional
engineering society in Europe.[75][76] Obsolescence of technical skills is a
serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in
technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of
continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET
(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in
Europe as an Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.[77]
In Australia, Canada, and the United States electrical engineers make up around
0.25% of the labor force.[a]
***** Tools and work[edit] *****
From the Global_Positioning_System to electric_power_generation, electrical
engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies.
They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems
and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of
telecommunication_systems, the operation of electric_power_stations, the
lighting and wiring of buildings, the design of household_appliances, or the
electrical control of industrial machinery.[81]
Satellite_communications is typical of what electrical engineers work on.
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as
these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how
such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of
computers and it is commonplace to use computer-aided_design programs when
designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is
still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.
The Shadow_robot_hand system
Although most electrical engineers will understand basic circuit_theory (that
is the interactions of elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes,
transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers
generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum_mechanics and
solid_state_physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the
design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working
with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit_theory may not be relevant to
a person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components.
Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are
reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong_numerical_skills,
computer_literacy, and the ability to understand the technical_language_and
concepts that relate to electrical engineering.[82]

reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.
A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers. For simple
control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and
resistance may suffice. Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the
oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. In RF_engineering and high
frequency telecommunications, spectrum_analyzers and network_analyzers are
used. In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with
instrumentation. For instance, medical electronics designers must take into
account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes
are directly in contact with internal body fluids.[83] Power transmission
engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used;
although voltmeters may in principle be similar to their low voltage
equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different.[84] Many
disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.
Audio electronics engineers use audio_test_sets consisting of a signal
generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters
such as harmonic_distortion and noise. Likewise, information technology have
their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same
is true of television broadcasting.

For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work
they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals
with clients, preparing budgets and determining project_schedules.[85] Many
senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this
reason project_management skills are important. Most engineering projects
involve some form of documentation and strong_written_communication skills are
therefore very important.
The workplaces of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do.
Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a
fabrication_plant, onboard a Naval_ship, the offices of a consulting_firm or on
site at a mine. During their working life, electrical engineers may find
themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists,
electricians, computer_programmers, and other engineers.[86]
Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences.
For instance, the physicist Lord_Kelvin played a major role in the engineering
of the first transatlantic_telegraph_cable.[87] Conversely, the engineer Oliver
Heaviside produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph
cables.[88] Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects.
For instance, large particle_accelerators such as CERN need electrical
engineers to deal with many aspects of the project: from the power
distribution, to the instrumentation, to the manufacture and installation of
the superconducting_electromagnets.[89][90]

   1. ^ In May 2014 there were around 175,000 people working as electrical
      engineers in the US.[78] In 2012, Australia had around 19,000[79] while
      in Canada, there were around 37,000 (as of 2007[update]), constituting
      about 0.2% of the labour force in each of the three countries. Australia
      and Canada reported that 96% and 88% of their electrical engineers
      respectively are male.[80]
