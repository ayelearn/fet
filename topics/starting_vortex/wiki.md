****** Starting vortex ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
A starting vortex behind a wing profile, made visible by plotting pressure
distribution in a CFD_simulation.
The starting vortex is a vortex which forms in the air adjacent to the trailing
edge of an airfoil as it is accelerated from rest in a fluid.[1] It leaves the
airfoil (which now has an equal but opposite "bound vortex" around it), and
remains (nearly) stationary in the flow.[2][3][4] It rapidly decays through the
action of viscosity.
The initial (and quite brief) presence of a starting vortex as an airfoil
begins to move was predicted by early aerodynamicists, and eventually
photographed.[5][6][7]
Whenever the speed or angle_of_attack of an airfoil changes there is a
corresponding amount of vorticity deposited in the wake behind the airfoil,
joining the two trailing_vortices. This vorticity is a continuum of mini-
starting-vortexes. The wake behind an aircraft is a continuous sheet of weak
vorticity, between the two trailing vortices, and this accounts for the changes
in strength of the trailing vortices as the airspeed of the aircraft and angle
of attack on the wing change during flight.[8] (The strength of a vortex cannot
change within the fluid except by the dissipative action of viscosity. Vortices
either form continuous loops of constant strength, or they terminate at the
boundary of the fluid - usually a solid surface such as the ground.)
The starting vortex is significant to an understanding of the Kutta_condition
and its role in the circulation around any airfoil generating lift.
The starting vortex has certain similarities with the "starting plume" which
forms at the leading edge of a slug of fluid, when one fluid is injected into
another at rest. See plume_(hydrodynamics).
