Self-assembly is a process in which a disordered system of pre-existing
components forms an organized structure or pattern as a consequence of
specific, local interactions among the components themselves, without external
direction. When the constitutive components are molecules, the process is
termed molecular_self-assembly.

Self-assembly can be classified as either static or dynamic. In static self-
assembly, the ordered state forms as a system approaches equilibrium, reducing
its free_energy. However, in dynamic self-assembly, patterns of pre-existing
components organized by specific local interactions are not commonly described
as "self-assembled" by scientists in the associated disciplines. These
structures are better described as "self-organized", although these terms are
often used interchangeably.

***** Self-assembly in chemistry and materials science[edit] *****
The DNA structure at left (schematic shown) will self-assemble into the
structure visualized by atomic_force_microscopy at right.
Self-assembly in the classic sense can be defined as the spontaneous and
reversible organization of molecular units into ordered structures by non-
covalent_interactions. The first property of a self-assembled system that this
definition suggests is the spontaneity of the self-assembly process: the
interactions responsible for the formation of the self-assembled system act on
a strictly local levelâin other words, the nanostructure builds itself.
Although self-assembly typically occurs between weakly-interacting species,
this organizaiton may be transfered into strongly-bound covalent systems. An
example for this may be observed in the self-assembly of polyoxometalates.
Evidence suggests that such molecules assemble via a dense-phase type mechanism
whereby small oxometalate ions first assemble_non-covalently in solution,
followed by a condensation_reaction that covalently binds the assembled units.
[4] This process can be aided by the introduction of templating agents to
control the formed species.[5] In such a way, highly organized covalent
molecules may be formed in a specific manner.
Self-assembled nano-structure is an object that appears as a result of ordering
and aggregation of individual nano-scale objects guided by some physical
principle.
Self-assembled nanostructure arises in the strong non-equilibrium conditions.
The most famous example of self-assembly phenomenon is the occurrence of the
life on Earth. It is plausible to hypothesize that it happens because the sun
generates a strong temperate gradient in its environment. This general idea has
been confirmed in the experiment of self-assembly of carbon_nanotubes.
Another interesting example of self-assembly is the phenomenon of electrostatic
trapping. In this case an electric_field is applied between two metallic nano-
electrodes. The particles present in the environment are polarized by the
applied electric field. Because of dipole interaction with the electric field
gradient the particles are attracted to the gap between the electrodes.[6]
Fabricating a crystal by placing atom after atom is not realistic. However
self-assembly of crystals works well. Similarly fabricating a 3D nano-structure
is not realistic as well. Self-assembly of 3D nano-structure becomes an easy
and inexpensive way to fabricate them.[7][8]
Nano-structures such as nano-vacuum gaps are used for storing energy[9] and
nuclear energy conversion.[10] Self-assembled tunable_materials are promising
candidates for large surface area electrodes in batteries and organic
photovoltaic cells, as well as for microfluidic sensors and filters.[11]
**** Distinctive features[edit] ****
At this point, one may argue that any chemical reaction driving atoms and
molecules to assemble into larger structures, such as precipitation, could fall
into the category of self-assembly. However, there are at least three
distinctive features that make self-assembly a distinct concept.
*** Order[edit] ***
First, the self-assembled structure must have a higher order than the isolated
components, be it a shape or a particular task that the self-assembled entity
may perform. This is generally not true in chemical_reactions, where an ordered
state may proceed towards a disordered state depending on thermodynamic
parameters.
*** Interactions[edit] ***
The second important aspect of self-assembly is the key role of slack
interactions (e.g. Van_der_Waals, capillary, ___&#x03C0;_&#x2212;_&#x03C0;___
{\displaystyle_\pi_-\pi_}__[\pi_-\pi_], hydrogen_bonds) with respect to more
"traditional" covalent, ionic, or metallic_bonds. Although typically less
energetic by a factor of 10, these weak interactions play an important role in
materials synthesis. It can be instructive to note how slack interactions hold
a prominent place in materials, especially in biological systems, although they
are often considered marginal with respect to "strong" (i.e. covalent, etc.)
interactions. For instance, they determine the physical properties of liquids,
the solubility of solids, and the organization of molecules in biological
membranes.
*** Building blocks[edit] ***
The third distinctive feature of self-assembly is that the building blocks are
not only atoms and molecules, but span a wide range of nano- and mesoscopic
structures, with different chemical compositions, shapes and functionalities.
[12] Research into possible three-dimensional shapes of self-assembling
micrites examines Platonic_solids (regular polyhedral). The term âmicriteâ
was created by DARPA to refer to sub-millimeter sized microrobots, whose self-
organizing abilities may be compared with those of slime_mold.[13][14] Recent
examples of novel building blocks include polyhedra and patchy_particles.
Examples also included microparticles with complex geometries, such as
hemispherical,[15] dimer,[16] discs,[17] rods, molecules ,[18] as well as
multimers. These nanoscale building blocks can in turn be synthesized through
conventional chemical routes or by other self-assembly strategies such as
Directional_Entropic_Forces.
**** Thermodynamics and Kinetics[edit] ****
The self-assembly process in the microscopic region usually starts from
diffusion, initialized in nucleation (seeds), progresses to seeds growth, and
ends at Ostwald_ripening. The macroscopic region involves single-crystal growth
and aggregation of different particles, domains, and grains. The thermodynamic
driving free energy can be either enthalpic or entropic or both, i.e. either
bond formation or breaking (enthalpic) or packing order change (entropic). The
kinetics of the self-assembly process is usually related to diffusion, for
which the absorption/adsorption rate often follows a Langmuir_adsorption_model
which in the diffusion controlled concentration (relatively diluted solution)
can be estimated by the Fick's_laws_of_diffusion. The desorption rate is
determined by the bond strength of the surface molecules/atoms with a thermal
activation energy barrier. The growth rate is the competition between these two
processes.
**** Examples[edit] ****
Important examples of self-assembly in materials science include the formation
of molecular crystals, colloids, lipid_bilayers, phase-separated_polymers, and
self-assembled_monolayers.[19][20] The folding of polypeptide chains into
proteins and the folding of nucleic acids into their functional forms are
examples of self-assembled biological structures. Recently, the three-
dimensional macroporous structure was prepared via self-assembly of
diphenylalanine derivative under cryoconditions, the obtained material can find
the application in the field of regenerative medicine or drug delivery system.
[21] P. Chen et al. demonstrated a microscale self-assembly method using the
air-liquid interface established by Faraday_wave as a template. This self-
assembly method can be used for generation of diverse sets of symmetrical and
periodic patterns from microscale materials such as hydrogels, cells, and cell
spheroids.[22]
**** Properties[edit] ****
Self-assembly extends the scope of chemistry aiming at synthesizing products
with order and functionality properties, extending chemical bonds to weak
interactions and encompassing the self-assembly of nanoscale building blocks at
all length scales.[23] In covalent synthesis and polymerization, the scientist
links atoms together in any desired conformation, which does not necessarily
have to be the energetically most favoured position; self-assembling molecules,
on the other hand, adopt a structure at the thermodynamic minimum, finding the
best combination of interactions between subunits but not forming covalent
bonds between them. In self-assembling structures, the scientist must predict
this minimum, not merely place the atoms in the location desired.
Another characteristic common to nearly all self-assembled systems is their
thermodynamic_stability. For self-assembly to take place without intervention
of external forces, the process must lead to a lower Gibbs_free_energy, thus
self-assembled structures are thermodynamically more stable than the single,
unassembled components. A direct consequence is the general tendency of self-
assembled structures to be relatively free of defects. An example is the
formation of two-dimensional superlattices composed of an orderly arrangement
of micrometre-sized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spheres, starting from a
solution containing the microspheres, in which the solvent is allowed to
evaporate slowly in suitable conditions. In this case, the driving force is
capillary interaction, which originates from the deformation of the surface of
a liquid caused by the presence of floating or submerged particles.[24]
These two propertiesâweak interactions and thermodynamic stabilityâcan be
recalled to rationalise another property often found in self-assembled systems:
the sensitivity to perturbations exerted by the external environment. These are
small fluctuations that alter thermodynamic variables that might lead to marked
changes in the structure and even compromise it, either during or after self-
assembly. The weak nature of interactions is responsible for the flexibility of
the architecture and allows for rearrangements of the structure in the
direction determined by thermodynamics. If fluctuations bring the thermodynamic
variables back to the starting condition, the structure is likely to go back to
its initial configuration. This leads us to identify one more property of self-
assembly, which is generally not observed in materials synthesized by other
techniques: reversibility.
Self-assembly is a process which is easily influenced by external parameters.
This feature can make synthesis rather complex because of the need to control
many free parameters. Yet self-assembly has the advantage that a large variety
of shapes and functions on many length scales can be obtained.[25]
The fundamental condition needed for nanoscale building blocks to self-assemble
into an ordered structure is the simultaneous presence of long-range repulsive
and short-range attractive forces.[26]
By choosing precursors with suitable physicochemical properties, it is possible
to exert a fine control on the formation processes that produce complex
structures. Clearly, the most important tool when it comes to designing a
synthesis strategy for a material, is the knowledge of the chemistry of the
building units. For example, it was demonstrated that it was possible to use
diblock_copolymers with different block reactivities in order to selectively
embed maghemite nanoparticles and generate periodic materials with potential
use as waveguides.[27]
In 2008 it was proposed that every self-assembly process presents a co-
assembly, which makes the former term a misnomer. This thesis is built on the
concept of mutual ordering of the self-assembling system and its environment.
[28]
***** Self-assembly at the macroscopic scale[edit] *****
The most common examples of self-assembly at the macroscopic scale can be seen
at interfaces between gases and liquids, where molecules can be confined at the
nanoscale in the vertical direction and spread over long distances laterally.
Examples of self-assembly at gas-liquid interfaces include breath-figures,
self-assembled_monolayers and LangmuirâBlodgett_films, while crystallization
of fullerene whiskers is an example of macroscopic self-assembly in between two
liquids.[7][8] Another remarkable example of macroscopic self-assembly is the
formation of thin quasicrystals at an air-liquid interface, which can be built
up not only by inorganic, but also by organic molecular units.[29][30]
Self-assembly processes can also be observed in systems of macroscopic building
blocks. These building blocks can be externally propelled[31] or self-
propelled.[32] Since the 1950s, scientists have built self-assembly systems
exhibiting centimeter-sized components ranging from passive mechanical parts to
mobile robots.[33] For systems at this scale, the component design can be
precisely controlled. For some systems, the components' interaction preferences
are programmable. The self-assembly processes can be easily monitored and
analyzed by the components themselves or by external observers.[34]
In April 2014, a 3D_printed plastic was combined with a "smart material" that
self-assembles in water,[35] resulting in "4D_printing".[36]
***** Consistent concepts of self-organization and self-assembly[edit] *****
People regularly use the terms "self-organization" and "self-assembly"
interchangeably. As complex_system science becomes more popular though, there
is a higher need to clearly distinguish the differences between the two
mechanisms to understand their significance in physical and biological systems.
Both processes explain how collective order develops from "dynamic small-scale
interactions".[37] Self-organization is a non-equilibrium process where self-
assembly is a spontaneous process that leads toward equilibrium. Self-assembly
requires components to remain essentially unchanged throughout the process.
Besides the thermodynamic difference between the two, there is also a
difference in formation. The first difference is what "encodes the global order
of the whole" in self-assembly whereas in self-organization this initial
encoding is not necessary. Another slight contrast refers to the minimum number
of units needed to make an order. Self-organization appears to have a minimum
number of units whereas self-assembly does not. The concepts may have
particular application in connection with natural_selection.[38] Eventually,
these patterns may form one theory of pattern_formation in nature.[39]

      PMID 18353531. We argue that critical-like dynamics self-organize
      relatively easily in non-equilibrium systems, and that in biological
      systems such dynamics serve as templates upon which natural selection
      builds further elaborations. These critical-like states can be modified
      by natural selection in two fundamental ways, reflecting the selective
      advantage (if any) of heritable variations either among avalanche
      participants or among whole systems.

      possible to integrate these pattern forming mechanisms into the one
      general theory of pattern formation in nature.
