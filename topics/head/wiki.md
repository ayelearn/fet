Anatomical_terminology
[edit_on_Wikidata]
A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain,
forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various
sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste, respectively. Some
very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally_symmetric_forms
do, regardless of size.
Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. In
bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous_tissues concentrate at the anterior
region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through
biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into
the anterior region; these collectively form the head.

***** Human head[edit] *****
Main articles: Human_head and Head_and_neck_anatomy
The human_head is an anatomical unit that consists of the skull, hyoid_bone and
cervical_vertebrae. The term "skull" collectively denotes the mandible (lower
jaw bone) and the cranium (upper portion of the skull that houses the brain).
The skull can also be described as being composed of the cranium, which
encloses the cranial_cavity, and the facial_skeleton (includes the mandible).
There are eight bones in the cranium and fourteen in the facial skeleton.[1]
Sculptures of human heads are generally based on a skeletal structure that
consists of a cranium, jawbone, and cheekbone. Though the number of muscles
making up the face is generally consistent between sculptures, the shape of the
muscles varies widely based on the function, development, and expressions
reflected on the faces of the subjects.[2]
Proponents of identism believe that the mind is identical to the brain.
Philosopher John_Searle asserts his identist beliefs, stating "the brain is the
only thing in the human head". Similarly, Dr. Henry Bennet-Clark has stated
that the head encloses billions of "miniagents and microagents (with no single
Boss)".[3]

***** Other animals[edit] *****
The evolution of a head is associated with the cephalization that occurred in
Bilateria some 555 million years ago.
**** Arthropods[edit] ****
Main article: Cephalon_(arthropod_head)
In some arthropods, especially trilobites (pictured at right), the cephalon, or
cephalic region, is the region of the head which is a collective of "fused
segments".[4]
*** Insects[edit] ***
Head of a Nomada-species bee
A typical insect head is composed of eyes, antennae, and components of mouth.
As these components differ substantially from insect to insect, they form
important identification links. Eyes in the head found, in several types of
insects, are in the form of a pair of compound eyes with multiple faces. In
many other types of insects the compound eyes are seen in a "single facet or
group of single facets". In some case, the eyes may be seen as marks on the
dorsal or located near or toward the head, two or three ocelli (single faceted
organs).[5]
Antennae on the insect's head is found in the form of segmented attachments, in
pairs, that are usually located between the eyes. These are in varying shapes
and sizes, in the form of filaments or in different enlarged or clubbed form.
[5]
Insects have mouth parts in various shapes depending on their feeding habits.
Labrum is the "upper lip" which is in the front area of the head and is the
most exterior part. A pair of mandible is found on backside of the labrum
flanking the side of the mouth, succeeded by a pair of maxillae each of which
is known as maxilliary_palp. At the back side of the mouth is the labium or
lower lip. There is also an extra mouth part in some insects which is termed as
hypopharynx which is usually located between the maxillac.[5]
**** Vertebrates and the "new head hypothesis"[edit] ****
Though invertebrate chordates â such as the tunicate larvae or the lancelets
â have heads, there has been a question of how the vertebrate head,
characterized by a bony skull clearly separated from the main body, might have
evolved from the head structures of these animals.[6]
According to Hyman (1979), the evolution of the head in the vertebrates has
occurred by the fusion of a fixed number of anterior segments, in the same
manner as in other "heteronomously segmented animals". In some cases, segments
or a portion of the segments disappear. The head segments also lose most of its
systems except for the nervous system. With the progressive development of
cephalization, "the head incorporates more and more of the adjacent segments
into its structure, so that in general it may be said that the higher the
degree of cephalization the greater is the number of segments composing the
head".[7]
In the 1980s, the "new head hypothesis" was proposed, suggesting that the
vertebrate head is an evolutionary novelty resulting from the emergence of
neural_crest and cranial placodes.[8][9] In 2014, a transient larva tissue of
the lancelet was found to be virtually indistinguishable from the neural_crest-
derived cartilage which forms the vertebrate skull, suggesting that persistence
of this tissue and expansion into the entire headspace could be a viable
evolutionary route to formation of the vertebrate head.[6]
***** In society and culture[edit] *****
**** Heraldry[edit] ****
Main article: Heads_in_heraldry
The heads of humans and other animals are commonly recurring charges in
heraldry.[10] Heads of humans are sometimes blazoned simply as a "man's head",
but are far more frequently described in greater detail, either characteristic
of a particular race or nationality (such as Moors' heads, Saxons' heads,
Egyptians' heads or Turks' heads), or specifically identified (such as the head
of Moses in the crest of Hilton, or the head of St. John the Baptist in the
crest of the London Company of Tallowchandlers).[10][11] Several varieties of
women's heads also occur, including maidens' heads (often couped under the
bust, with hair disheveled), ladies' heads, nuns' heads (often veiled), and
occasionally queens' heads. The arms of Devaney of Norfolk include "three nun's
heads veiled couped at the shoulders proper," and the bust of a queen occurs in
the arms of Queenborough, Kent.[10] Infants' or children's heads are often
couped at the shoulders with a snake wrapped around the neck (e.g. "Argent, a
boy's head proper, crined or, couped below the shoulders, vested gules,
tarnished gold," in the arms of Boyman).[10]

**** Art[edit] ****
Study on the proportions of head and eyes by Leonardo_da_Vinci
"Head of a young man" â Domenico_Beccafumi
One of the ways of drawing sketches of headsâas Jack_Hamm advisesâis to
develop it in six well-defined steps starting with the shape of the head in the
shape of an egg. Female head, in particular, is sketched in a double circle
design procedure with proportions considered as an ideal of a female head. In
the first circle, the division is made of five sections on the diameter, each
section of five eyes width. It is then developed over a series of ten defined
steps with the smaller circle imposed partially over the larger circle at the
lower end at the fourth stage. Eyes and chins are fitted in various shapes to
form the head.[12]
Leonardo_Da_Vinci was one of the worldâs greatest artists who drew sketches
of human anatomy using grid structures. His image of the face drawn on the grid
structure principle is in perfect proportion.[13] In this genre, using the
technique of pen and ink, Leonardo created a sketch which is a "Study on the
proportions of head and eyes" (pictured).[14]
**** Idiomatic expressions[edit] ****
An idiom is a phrase or a fixed expression that has a figurative, or sometimes
literal, meaning.
    * "To come to a head" â to reach a critical stage and require immediate
      action[15]
    * "To bite someone's head off" â to criticize someone strongly[16]
    * "Can't make head or tail of something" â cannot understand something
      [17]
    * "A head start" â an early start that provides an advantage over others
      [18]
    * "Head and shoulders above someone or something" â better than someone
      or something in some way[19]
    * "To want someone's head on a platter" â to want someone severely
      punished[20]
    * "To bang your head against a brick wall" â to continually try to
      achieve something without success[21]
    * "To have one's head in the clouds" â to not pay attention to what is
      happening around one because one is so absorbed by one's own thoughts[22]
      [23]
**** Engineering and scientific fields[edit] ****
The head's function and appearance play an analogous role in the etymology of
many technical terms. Cylinder_head, pothead, and weatherhead are three such
examples.
