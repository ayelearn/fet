System for uniquely determining the position of a point in a space of dimension
n, by an n-tuplet of scalars
"Coordinate" redirects here. For coordinates of the Earth, see Geographic
coordinate_system. For other uses, see Coordinate_(disambiguation).
For geographical coordinates on Wikipedia, see Template:Coord.
The spherical_coordinate_system is commonly used in physics. It assigns three
numbers (known as coordinates) to every point in Euclidean_space: radial
distance r, polar angle Î¸ (theta), and azimuthal angle Ï (phi). The symbol Ï
(rho) is often used instead of r.
In geometry, a coordinate system is a system that uses one or more numbers, or
coordinates, to uniquely determine the position of the points or other
geometric elements on a manifold such as Euclidean_space.[1][2] The order of
the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their
position in an ordered tuple and sometimes by a letter, as in "the x-
coordinate". The coordinates are taken to be real_numbers in elementary
mathematics, but may be complex_numbers or elements of a more abstract system
such as a commutative_ring. The use of a coordinate system allows problems in
geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and vice versa; this is
the basis of analytic_geometry.[3]

***** Common coordinate systems[edit] *****
**** Number line[edit] ****
Main article: Number_line
The simplest example of a coordinate system is the identification of points on
a line with real numbers using the number_line. In this system, an arbitrary
point O (the origin) is chosen on a given line. The coordinate of a point P is
defined as the signed distance from O to P, where the signed distance is the
distance taken as positive or negative depending on which side of the line P
lies. Each point is given a unique coordinate and each real number is the
coordinate of a unique point.[4]
[The_number_line]
**** Cartesian coordinate system[edit] ****
Main article: Cartesian_coordinate_system
The Cartesian_coordinate_system in the plane.
The prototypical example of a coordinate system is the Cartesian_coordinate
system. In the plane, two perpendicular lines are chosen and the coordinates of
a point are taken to be the signed distances to the lines.
[Rectangular_coordinates.svg]
In three dimensions, three mutually orthogonal planes are chosen and the three
coordinates of a point are the signed distances to each of the planes.[5] This
can be generalized to create n coordinates for any point in n-dimensional
Euclidean_space.
Depending on the direction and order of the coordinate axes, the three-
dimensional system may be a right-handed or a left-handed system. This is one
of many coordinate systems.
**** Polar coordinate system[edit] ****
Main article: Polar_coordinate_system
Another common coordinate system for the plane is the polar coordinate system.
[6] A point is chosen as the pole and a ray from this point is taken as the
polar axis. For a given angle Î¸, there is a single line through the pole whose
angle with the polar axis is Î¸ (measured counterclockwise from the axis to the
line). Then there is a unique point on this line whose signed distance from the
origin is r for given number r. For a given pair of coordinates (r, Î¸) there
is a single point, but any point is represented by many pairs of coordinates.
For example, (r, Î¸), (r, Î¸+2Ï) and (âr, Î¸+Ï) are all polar coordinates
for the same point. The pole is represented by (0, Î¸) for any value of Î¸.
**** Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems[edit] ****
Main articles: Cylindrical_coordinate_system and Spherical_coordinate_system
There are two common methods for extending the polar coordinate system to three
dimensions. In the cylindrical coordinate system, a z-coordinate with the same
meaning as in Cartesian coordinates is added to the r and Î¸ polar coordinates
giving a triple (r, Î¸, z).[7] Spherical coordinates take this a step further
by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (r, z) to polar coordinates
(Ï, Ï) giving a triple (Ï, Î¸, Ï).[8]
**** Homogeneous coordinate system[edit] ****
Main article: Homogeneous_coordinates
A point in the plane may be represented in homogeneous coordinates by a triple
(x, y, z) where x/z and y/z are the Cartesian coordinates of the point.[9] This
introduces an "extra" coordinate since only two are needed to specify a point
on the plane, but this system is useful in that it represents any point on the
projective_plane without the use of infinity. In general, a homogeneous
coordinate system is one where only the ratios of the coordinates are
significant and not the actual values.
**** Other commonly used systems[edit] ****
Some other common coordinate systems are the following:
    * Curvilinear_coordinates are a generalization of coordinate systems
      generally; the system is based on the intersection of curves.
          o Orthogonal_coordinates: coordinate_surfaces meet at right angles
          o Skew_coordinates: coordinate_surfaces are not orthogonal
    * The log-polar_coordinate_system represents a point in the plane by the
      logarithm of the distance from the origin and an angle measured from a
      reference line intersecting the origin.
    * PlÃ¼cker_coordinates are a way of representing lines in 3D Euclidean
      space using a six-tuple of numbers as homogeneous_coordinates.
    * Generalized_coordinates are used in the Lagrangian treatment of
      mechanics.
    * Canonical_coordinates are used in the Hamiltonian treatment of mechanics.
    * Barycentric_coordinate_system as used for ternary_plots and more
      generally in the analysis of triangles.
    * Trilinear_coordinates are used in the context of triangles.
There are ways of describing curves without coordinates, using intrinsic
equations that use invariant quantities such as curvature and arc_length. These
include:
    * The Whewell_equation relates arc length and the tangential_angle.
    * The CesÃ ro_equation relates arc length and curvature.
***** Coordinates of geometric objects[edit] *****
Coordinates systems are often used to specify the position of a point, but they
may also be used to specify the position of more complex figures such as lines,
planes, circles or spheres. For example, PlÃ¼cker_coordinates are used to
determine the position of a line in space.[10] When there is a need, the type
of figure being described is used to distinguish the type of coordinate system,
for example the term line_coordinates is used for any coordinate system that
specifies the position of a line.
It may occur that systems of coordinates for two different sets of geometric
figures are equivalent in terms of their analysis. An example of this is the
systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective
plane. The two systems in a case like this are said to be dualistic. Dualistic
systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to
the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same
analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.[11]
***** Transformations[edit] *****
See also: Active_and_passive_transformation
Main article: List_of_common_coordinate_transformations
Because there are often many different possible coordinate systems for
describing geometrical figures, it is important to understand how they are
related. Such relations are described by coordinate transformations which give
formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in
another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and
polar coordinates (r, Î¸) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the
positive x axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian
coordinates is given by x = r cosÎ¸ and y = r sinÎ¸.
With every bijection from the space to itself two coordinate transformations
can be associated:
    * such that the new coordinates of the image of each point are the same as
      the old coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping
      are the inverse of those for the coordinate transformation)
    * such that the old coordinates of the image of each point are the same as
      the new coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping
      are the same as those for the coordinate transformation)
For example, in 1D, if the mapping is a translation of 3 to the right, the
first moves the origin from 0 to 3, so that the coordinate of each point
becomes 3 less, while the second moves the origin from 0 to â3, so that the
coordinate of each point becomes 3 more.
***** Coordinate lines/curves and planes/surfaces[edit] *****
"Coordinate line" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Line
coordinates.
"Coordinate plane" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Plane
coordinates.
In two dimensions, if one of the coordinates in a point coordinate system is
held constant and the other coordinate is allowed to vary, then the resulting
curve is called a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system the
coordinate curves are, in fact, straight_lines, thus coordinate lines.
Specifically, they are the lines parallel to one of the coordinate axes. For
other coordinate systems the coordinates curves may be general curves. For
example, the coordinate curves in polar coordinates obtained by holding r
constant are the circles with center at the origin. Coordinates systems for
Euclidean space other than the Cartesian coordinate system are called
curvilinear_coordinate_systems.[12] This procedure does not always make sense,
for example there are no coordinate curves in a homogeneous_coordinate_system.
Coordinate surfaces of the three-dimensional paraboloidal coordinates.
In three-dimensional space, if one coordinate is held constant and the other
two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a coordinate
surface. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding Ï constant
in the spherical_coordinate_system are the spheres with center at the origin.
In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a
coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system we may speak of coordinate
planes.
Similarly, coordinate hypersurfaces are the (n â 1)-dimensional spaces
resulting from fixing a single coordinate of an n-dimensional coordinate
system.[13]
***** Coordinate maps[edit] *****
Main article: Coordinate_map
Further information: Manifold
The concept of a coordinate map, or coordinate chart is central to the theory
of manifolds. A coordinate map is essentially a coordinate system for a subset
of a given space with the property that each point has exactly one set of
coordinates. More precisely, a coordinate map is a homeomorphism from an open
subset of a space X to an open subset of Rn.[14] It is often not possible to
provide one consistent coordinate system for an entire space. In this case, a
collection of coordinate maps are put together to form an atlas covering the
space. A space equipped with such an atlas is called a manifold and additional
structure can be defined on a manifold if the structure is consistent where the
coordinate maps overlap. For example, a differentiable_manifold is a manifold
where the change of coordinates from one coordinate map to another is always a
differentiable function.
***** Orientation-based coordinates[edit] *****
In geometry and kinematics, coordinate systems are used to describe the
(linear) position of points and the angular_position of axes, planes, and rigid
bodies.[15] In the latter case, the orientation of a second (typically referred
to as "local") coordinate system, fixed to the node, is defined based on the
first (typically referred to as "global" or "world" coordinate system). For
instance, the orientation of a rigid body can be represented by an orientation
matrix, which includes, in its three columns, the Cartesian_coordinates of
three points. These points are used to define the orientation of the axes of
the local system; they are the tips of three unit_vectors aligned with those
axes.
