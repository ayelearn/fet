Turning a bar of metal on a lathe
Metalworking is the process of working with metals to create individual parts,
assemblies, or large-scale structures. The term covers a wide range of work
from large ships and bridges to precise engine parts and delicate jewelry. It
therefore includes a correspondingly wide range of skills, processes, and
tools.
Metalworking is a science, art,[1][2] hobby, industry and trade. Its historical
roots span cultures, civilizations, and millennia. Metalworking has evolved
from the discovery of smelting various ores, producing malleable and ductile
metal useful tools and adornments. Modern metalworking processes, though
diverse and specialized, can be categorized as forming, cutting, or joining
processes. Today's machine_shop includes a number of machine_tools capable of
creating a precise, useful workpiece.

***** Prehistory[edit] *****
The oldest archaeological evidence of copper mining and working was the
discovery of a copper pendant in northern_Iraq from 8,700 BCE.[3] The earliest
substantiated and dated evidence of metalworking in the Americas was the
processing of copper in Wisconsin, near Lake_Michigan. Copper was hammered
until brittle then heated so it could be worked some more. This technology is
dated to about 4000-5000 BCE.[4] The oldest gold artifacts in the world come
from the Bulgarian Varna_Necropolis and date from 4450 BCE.
Not all metal required fire to obtain it or work it. Isaac_Asimov speculated
that gold was the "first metal".[5] His reasoning is that by its chemistry it
is found in nature as nuggets of pure gold. In other words, gold, as rare as it
is, is sometimes found in nature as the metal that it is. There are a few other
metals that sometimes occur natively, and as a result of meteors. Almost all
other metals are found in ores, a mineral-bearing rock, that require heat or
some other process to liberate the metal. Another feature of gold is that it is
workable as it is found, meaning that no technology beyond a stone hammer and
anvil to work the metal is needed. This is a result of gold's properties of
malleability and ductility. The earliest tools were stone, bone, wood, and
sinew, all of which sufficed to work gold.
At some unknown point the connection between heat and the liberation of metals
from rock became clear, and rocks rich in copper, tin, and lead came into
demand. These ores were mined wherever they were recognized. Remnants of such
ancient mines have been found all over Southwestern_Asia.[6] Metalworking was
being carried out by the South_Asian inhabitants of Mehrgarh between
7000â3300 BCE.[7] The end of the beginning of metalworking occurs sometime
around 6000 BCE when copper smelting became common in Southwestern Asia.
Ancient civilisations knew of seven metals. Here they are arranged in order of
their oxidation_potential (in volts):
    * Iron +0.44 V,
    * Tin +0.14 V
    * Lead +0.13 V
    * Copper â0.34 V
    * Mercury â0.79 V
    * Silver â0.80 V
    * Gold â1.50 V.
The oxidation potential is important because it is one indicator of how tightly
bound to the ore the metal is likely to be. As can be seen, iron is
significantly higher than the other six metals while gold is dramatically lower
than the six above it. Gold's low oxidation is one of the main reasons that
gold is found in nuggets. These nuggets are relatively pure gold and are
workable as they are found.
Copper ore, being relatively abundant, and tin ore became the next important
players in the story of metalworking. Using heat to smelt copper from ore, a
great deal of copper was produced. It was used for both jewelry and simple
tools. However, copper by itself was too soft for tools requiring edges and
stiffness. At some point tin was added into the molten copper and bronze was
born. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Bronze was an important advance
because it had the edge-durability and stiffness that pure copper lacked. Until
the advent of iron, bronze was the most advanced metal for tools and weapons in
common use (see Bronze_Age for more detail).
Outside Southwestern Asia, these same advances and materials were being
discovered and used around the world. China and Great_Britain jumped into the
use of bronze with little time being devoted to copper. Japan began the use of
bronze and iron almost simultaneously. In the Americas things were different.
Although the peoples of the Americas knew of metals, it was not until the
European_colonisation that metalworking for tools and weapons became common.
Jewelry and art were the principal uses of metals in the Americas prior to
European influence.
Around 2700 BCE, production of bronze was common in locales where the necessary
materials could be assembled for smelting, heating, and working the metal. Iron
was beginning to be smelted and began its emergence as an important metal for
tools and weapons. The period that followed became known as the Iron_Age.
***** History[edit] *****

By the historical periods of the Pharaohs in Egypt, the Vedic Kings in India,
the Tribes_of_Israel, and the Maya_civilization in North_America, among other
ancient populations, precious_metals began to have value attached to them. In
some cases rules for ownership, distribution, and trade were created, enforced,
and agreed upon by the respective peoples. By the above periods metalworkers
were very skilled at creating objects of adornment, religious artifacts, and
trade instruments of precious_metals (non-ferrous), as well as weaponry usually
of ferrous metals and/or alloys. These skills were finely honed and well
executed. The techniques were practiced by artisans, blacksmiths, atharvavedic
practitioners, alchemists, and other categories of metalworkers around the
globe. For example, the granulation technique was employed by numerous ancient
cultures before the historic record shows people traveled to far regions to
share this process. This and many other ancient techniques are still used by
metalsmiths today.
As time progressed metal objects became more common, and ever more complex. The
need to further acquire and work metals grew in importance. Skills related to
extracting metal ores from the earth began to evolve, and metalsmiths became
more knowledgeable. Metalsmiths became important members of society. Fates and
economies of entire civilizations were greatly affected by the availability of
metals and metalsmiths. The metalworker depends on the extraction of precious
metals to make jewelry, build more efficient electronics, and for industrial
and technological applications from construction to shipping containers to
rail, and air_transport. Without metals, goods and services would cease to move
around the globe on the scale we know today.
***** General processes[edit] *****
A combination_square used for transferring designs.
A caliper is used to precisely measure a short length.
Metalworking generally is divided into the following categories, forming,
cutting, and, joining. Most metal cutting is done by high speed steel tools or
carbide tools.[8] Each of these categories contain various processes.
Prior to most operations, the metal must be marked out and/or measured,
depending on the desired finished product.
Marking_out (also known as layout) is the process of transferring a design or
pattern to a workpiece and is the first step in the handcraft of metalworking.
It is performed in many industries or hobbies, although in industry, the
repetition eliminates the need to mark out every individual piece. In the metal
trades area, marking out consists of transferring the engineer's plan to the
workpiece in preparation for the next step, machining or manufacture.
Calipers are hand tools designed to precisely measure the distance between two
points. Most calipers have two sets of flat, parallel edges used for inner or
outer diameter measurements. These calipers can be accurate to within one-
thousandth of an inch (25.4 Î¼m). Different types of calipers have different
mechanisms for displaying the distance measured. Where larger objects need to
be measured with less precision, a tape_measure is often used.

***** Casting[edit] *****
A sand casting mold
Main article: Metal_casting
Casting achieves a specific form by pouring molten metal into a mold and
allowing it to cool, with no mechanical force. Forms of casting include:
    * Investment_casting (called lost_wax_casting in art)
    * Centrifugal_casting
    * Die_casting
    * Sand_casting
    * Shell_casting
    * Spin_casting
***** Forming processes[edit] *****
These forming processes modify metal or workpiece by deforming the object, that
is, without removing any material. Forming is done with a system of mechanical
forces and, especially for bulk metal forming, with heat.
**** Bulk forming processes[edit] ****
A red-hot metal workpiece is inserted into a forging press.
Plastic deformation involves using heat or pressure to make a workpiece more
conductive to mechanical force. Historically, this and casting were done by
blacksmiths, though today the process has been industrialized. In bulk metal
forming, the workpiece is generally heated up.

These types of forming process involve the application of mechanical force at
room temperature. However, some recent developments involve the heating of dies
and/or parts. Advancements in automated metalworking technology have made
progressive die stamping possible which is a method that can encompass
punching, coining, bending and several other ways below that modify metal at
less cost while resulting in less scrap.[11]

***** Cutting processes[edit] *****
A CNC plasma_cutting machine.
Main article: Cutting
Cutting is a collection of processes wherein material is brought to a specified
geometry by removing excess material using various kinds of tooling to leave a
finished part that meets specifications. The net result of cutting is two
products, the waste or excess material, and the finished part. In woodworking,
the waste would be sawdust and excess wood. In cutting metals the waste is
chips or swarf and excess metal.
Cutting processes fall into one of three major categories:
    * Chip producing processes most commonly known as machining
    * Burning, a set of processes wherein the metal is cut by oxidizing a kerf
      to separate pieces of metal
    * Miscellaneous specialty process, not falling easily into either of the
      above categories
Drilling a hole in a metal part is the most common example of a chip producing
process. Using an oxy-fuel_cutting_torch to separate a plate of steel into
smaller pieces is an example of burning. Chemical milling is an example of a
specialty process that removes excess material by the use of etching chemicals
and masking chemicals.
There are many technologies available to cut metal, including:
    * Manual technologies: saw, chisel, shear_or_snips
    * Machine technologies: turning, milling, drilling, grinding, sawing
    * Welding/burning technologies: burning by laser, oxy-fuel_burning, and
      plasma
    * Erosion technologies: by water_jet, electric_discharge, or abrasive_flow
      machining.
    * Chemical technologies: Photochemical_machining
Cutting_fluid or coolant is used where there is significant friction and heat
at the cutting interface between a cutter such as a drill or an end mill and
the workpiece. Coolant is generally introduced by a spray across the face of
the tool and workpiece to decrease friction and temperature at the cutting
tool/workpiece interface to prevent excessive tool wear. In practice there are
many methods of delivering coolant.
**** Milling[edit] ****
A milling machine in operation, including coolant hoses.
Main article: Milling_(machining)
Milling is the complex shaping of metal or other materials by removing material
to form the final shape. It is generally done on a milling_machine, a power-
driven machine that in its basic form consists of a milling_cutter that rotates
about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in
multiple directions (usually two dimensions [x and y axis] relative to the
workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. It is possible to raise
the table (where the workpiece rests). Milling machines may be operated
manually or under computer_numerical_control (CNC), and can perform a vast
number of complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling_and
threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the
horizontal mill and vertical mill.
The pieces produced are usually complex 3D objects that are converted into x,
y, and z coordinates that are then fed into the CNC machine and allow it to
complete the tasks required. The milling machine can produce most parts in 3D,
but some require the objects to be rotated around the x, y, or z coordinate
axis (depending on the need). Tolerances come in a variety of standards,
depending on the locale. In countries still using the imperial system, this is
usually in the thousandths of an inch (Unit known as Thou), depending on the
specific machine. In many other European countries, standards following the ISO
are used instead.
In order to keep both the bit and material cool, a high temperature coolant is
used. In most cases the coolant is sprayed from a hose directly onto the bit
and material. This coolant can either be machine or user controlled, depending
on the machine.
Materials that can be milled range from aluminum to stainless steel and almost
everything in between. Each material requires a different speed on the milling
tool and varies in the amount of material that can be removed in one pass of
the tool. Harder materials are usually milled at slower speeds with small
amounts of material removed. Softer materials vary, but usually are milled with
a high bit speed.
The use of a milling machine adds costs that are factored into the
manufacturing process. Each time the machine is used coolant is also used,
which must be periodically added in order to prevent breaking bits. A milling
bit must also be changed as needed in order to prevent damage to the material.
Time is the biggest factor for costs. Complex parts can require hours to
complete, while very simple parts take only minutes. This in turn varies the
production time as well, as each part will require different amounts of time.
Safety is key with these machines. The bits are traveling at high speeds and
removing pieces of usually scalding hot metal. The advantage of having a CNC
milling machine is that it protects the machine operator.
**** Turning[edit] ****
A lathe cutting material from a workpiece.
Main article: Turning
Turning is a metal cutting process for producing a cylindrical surface with a
single point tool. The workpiece is rotated on a spindle and the cutting tool
is fed into it radially, axially or both. Producing surfaces perpendicular to
the workpiece axis is called facing. Producing surfaces using both radial and
axial feeds is called profiling.[13]
A lathe is a machine tool which spins a block or cylinder of material so that
when abrasive, cutting, or deformation_tools are applied to the workpiece, it
can be shaped to produce an object which has rotational_symmetry about an axis
of_rotation. Examples of objects that can be produced on a lathe include
candlestick holders, crankshafts, camshafts, and bearing mounts.
Lathes have four main components: the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the
tailstock. The bed is a precise & very strong base which all of the other
components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's spindle secures the
workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around
the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the
material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a line_shaft,
modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle
along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that
can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the
axis of rotation. A hardened cutting_tool is held at the desired height
(usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then
moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes
material from the workpiece. The tailstock can be slid along the axis of
rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further
secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.
Other operations that can be performed with a single point tool on a lathe are:
[13]
Chamfering: Cutting an angle on the corner of a cylinder.
Parting: The tool is fed radially into the workpiece to cut off the end of a
part.
Threading: A tool is fed along and across the outside or inside surface of
rotating parts to produce external or internal threads.
Boring: A single-point tool is fed linearly and parallel to the axis of
rotation to create a round hole.
Drilling: Feeding the drill into the workpiece axially.
Knurling: Uses a tool to produce a rough surface texture on the work piece.
Frequently used to allow grip by hand on a metal part.
Modern computer numerical control (CNC) lathes and (CNC) machining centres can
do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools. When driven tools
are used the work piece stops rotating and the driven tool executes the
machining operation with a rotating cutting tool. The CNC machines use x, y,
and z coordinates in order to control the turning tools and produce the
product. Most modern day CNC lathes are able to produce most turned objects in
3D.
Nearly all types of metal can be turned, although more time & specialist
cutting tools are needed for harder workpieces.
**** Threading[edit] ****
Three different types and sizes of taps.
Main article: Threading_(manufacturing)
There are many threading processes including: cutting threads with a tap_or
die, thread milling, single-point thread cutting, thread rolling, cold root
rolling and forming, and thread grinding. A tap is used to cut a female thread
on the inside surface of a pre-drilled hole, while a die cuts a male thread on
a preformed cylindrical rod.
**** Grinding[edit] ****
A surface grinder
Main article: Grinding_(abrasive_cutting)
Grinding uses an abrasive process to remove material from the workpiece. A
grinding machine is a machine tool used for producing very fine finishes,
making very light cuts, or high precision forms using an abrasive_wheel as the
cutting device. This wheel can be made up of various sizes and types of stones,
diamonds or inorganic materials.
The simplest grinder is a bench grinder or a hand-held angle grinder, for
deburring parts or cutting metal with a zip-disc.
Grinders have increased in size and complexity with advances in time and
technology. From the old days of a manual toolroom grinder sharpening endmills
for a production shop, to today's 30000 RPM CNC auto-loading manufacturing cell
producing jet turbines, grinding processes vary greatly.
Grinders need to be very rigid machines to produce the required finish. Some
grinders are even used to produce glass scales for positioning CNC machine
axis. The common rule is the machines used to produce scales be 10 times more
accurate than the machines the parts are produced for.
In the past grinders were used for finishing operations only because of
limitations of tooling. Modern grinding wheel materials and the use of
industrial diamonds or other man-made coatings (cubic boron nitride) on wheel
forms have allowed grinders to achieve excellent results in production
environments instead of being relegated to the back of the shop.
Modern technology has advanced grinding operations to include CNC controls,
high material removal rates with high precision, lending itself well to
aerospace applications and high volume production runs of precision components.
**** Filing[edit] ****
Main article: Filing_(metalworking)
A file is an abrasive surface like this one that allows machinists to remove
small, imprecise amounts of metal.
Filing is combination of grinding and saw tooth cutting using a file. Prior to
the development of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate
means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces.
The skilled use of a file allowed a machinist to work to fine tolerances and
was the hallmark of the craft. Files can vary in shape, coarseness, and whether
the teeth or single cut or double cut depending on what application the file is
to be used for.[14] Today filing is rarely used as a production technique in
industry, though it remains as a common method of deburring.
**** Other[edit] ****
Broaching is a machining operation used to cut keyways into shafts. Electron
beam_machining (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are
directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material.
Ultrasonic_machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or brittle
materials.
***** Joining processes[edit] *****
Mig welding
**** Welding[edit] ****
Main article: Welding
Welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or
thermoplastics, by causing coalescence. This is often done by melting the
workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material that
cools to become a strong joint, but sometimes pressure is used in conjunction
with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld.
Many different energy sources can be used for welding, including a gas flame,
an electric_arc, a laser, an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound. While
often an industrial process, welding can be done in many different
environments, including open air, underwater and in space. Regardless of
location, however, welding remains dangerous, and precautions must be taken to
avoid burns, electric_shock, poisonous fumes, and overexposure to ultraviolet
light.
**** Brazing[edit] ****
Main article: Brazing
Brazing is a joining process in which a filler metal is melted and drawn into a
capillary formed by the assembly of two or more work pieces. The filler metal
reacts metallurgically with the workpiece(s) and solidifies in the capillary,
forming a strong joint. Unlike welding, the work piece is not melted. Brazing
is similar to soldering, but occurs at temperatures in excess of 450 Â°C
(842 Â°F). Brazing has the advantage of producing less thermal stresses than
welding, and brazed assemblies tend to be more ductile than weldments because
alloying elements can not segregate and precipitate.
Brazing techniques include, flame brazing, resistance brazing, furnace brazing,
diffusion brazing, inductive brazing and vacuum brazing.
**** Soldering[edit] ****
Main article: Soldering
Soldering a printed circuit board.
Soldering is a joining process that occurs at temperatures below 450 Â°C
(842 Â°F). It is similar to brazing in the way that a filler is melted and
drawn into a capillary to form a join, although at a lower temperature. Because
of this lower temperature and different alloys used as fillers, the
metallurgical reaction between filler and work piece is minimal, resulting in a
weaker joint.
**** Riveting[edit] ****
Main article: Rivet
Riveting is one of the most ancient metalwork joining processes. Its use
declined markedly during the second half of the 20th century, but it still
retains important uses in industry and construction, and in artisan crafts such
as jewellery, medieval_armouring and metal_couture in the early 21st century.
The earlier use of rivets is being superseded by improvements in welding and
component fabrication techniques.
A rivet is essentially a two-headed and unthreaded bolt which holds two other
pieces of metal together. Holes are drilled or punched through the two pieces
of metal to be joined. The holes being aligned, a rivet is passed through the
holes and permanent heads are formed onto the ends of the rivet utilizing
hammers and forming dies (by either coldworking or hotworking). Rivets are
commonly purchased with one head already formed.
When it is necessary to remove rivets, one of the rivet's heads is sheared off
with a cold_chisel. The rivet is then driven out with a hammer and punch.
***** Associated processes[edit] *****
While these processes are not primary metalworking processes, they are often
performed before or after metalworking processes.
**** Heat treatment[edit] ****
Main article: Heat_treatment
Metals can be heat treated to alter the properties of strength, ductility,
toughness, hardness or resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes
include annealing, precipitation_hardening, quenching, and tempering. The
annealing process softens the metal by allowing recovery of cold work and grain
growth. Quenching can be used to harden alloy steels, or in precipitation
hardenable alloys, to trap dissolved solute atoms in solution. Tempering will
cause the dissolved alloying elements to precipitate, or in the case of
quenched steels, improve impact strength and ductile properties.
Often, mechanical and thermal treatments are combined in what is known as
thermo-mechanical treatments for better properties and more efficient
processing of materials. These processes are common to high alloy special
steels, super alloys and titanium alloys.
**** Plating[edit] ****
Main article: Plating
Electroplating is a common surface-treatment technique. It involves bonding a
thin layer of another metal such as gold, silver, chromium or zinc to the
surface of the product by hydrolysis. It is used to reduce corrosion, create
abrasion resistance and improve the product's aesthetic appearance. Plating can
even change the properties of the original part including conductivity, heat
dissipation or structural integrity. There are four main electroplating methods
to ensure proper coating and cost effectiveness per product: mass plating, rack
plating, continuous plating and line plating.[15]
**** Thermal spraying[edit] ****
Main article: Thermal_spraying
Thermal spraying techniques are another popular finishing option, and often
have better high temperature properties than electroplated coatings due to the
thicker coating. The four main thermal spray processes include electric wire
arc spray, flame (oxy acetylene combustion) spray, plasma spray and high
velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) spray.[16]
