All of the people born and living at about the same time, regarded
collectively.
This article is about the social sciences concepts. For generation of
electricity, see Electricity_generation. For biological life stages, see
Biological_life_cycle. For other uses, see Generation_(disambiguation).
A generation is "all of the people born and living at about the same time,
regarded collectively." It can also be described as, "the average period,
generally considered to be about thirty years, during which children are born
and grow_up, become adults, and begin to have children of their own".[1] In
kinship terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child
relationship. It is also known as biogenesis, reproduction, or procreation in
the biological_sciences.
Generation is also often used synonymously with cohort in social_science; under
this formulation it means "people within a delineated population who experience
the same significant events within a given period of time".[2] Generations in
this sense of birth cohort, also known as "social generations", are widely used
in popular culture, and have been the basis for sociological analysis. Serious
analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an
increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea
of youthful rebellion against the established social order. Some analysts
believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a
society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other
factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word generate comes from the Latin generÄre, meaning "to beget".[3] The
word generation as a Group_or_cohort in social_science signifies the entire
body of individuals born and living at about the same time, most of whom are
approximately the same age and have similar ideas, problems, and attitudes
(e.g., Beat_Generation and Lost_Generation).[4]
***** Familial generation[edit] *****
Five generations of one Armenian familyâa child with her mother, grandmother,
great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother. (photograph dated from book
published in 1901)
A familial generation is a group of living beings constituting a single step in
the line of descent from an ancestor.[5] In developed nations the average
familial_generation_length is in the high 20s and has even reached 30 years in
some nations.[6] Factors such as greater industrialisation and demand for cheap
female labour, urbanisation, delayed first pregnancy and a greater uncertainty
in relationship stability have all contributed to the increase of the
generation length from the late 18th century to the present. These changes can
be attributed to social factors, such as GDP and state policy, and related
individual-level variables, particularly a woman's educational attainment.[7]
Conversely, generation length has changed little and remains in the low 20s in
less developed nations.[6][8]
An intergenerational_rift in the nuclear_family, between the parents and two_or
more_of_their_children, is one of several possible dynamics_of_a_dysfunctional
family. Coalitions in families are subsystems within families with more rigid
boundaries and are thought to be a sign of family dysfunction.[9]
***** Social generation[edit] *****
Social generations are cohorts of people born in the same date range and who
share similar cultural experiences.[10] The idea of a social generation, in the
sense that it is used today, gained currency in the 19th century. Prior to that
the concept "generation" had generally referred to family relationships and not
broader social groupings. In 1863, French lexicographer Emile_LittrÃ© had
defined a generation as, "all people coexisting in society at any given time".
[11]:19
Several trends promoted a new idea of generations, as the 19th century wore on,
of a society divided into different categories of people based on age. These
trends were all related to the processes of modernisation, industrialisation,
or westernisation, which had been changing the face of Europe since the mid-
18th century. One was a change in mentality about time and social change. The
increasing prevalence of enlightenment ideas encouraged the idea that society
and life were changeable, and that civilization could progress. This encouraged
the equation of youth with social renewal and change. Political rhetoric in the
19th century often focused on the renewing power of youth influenced by
movements such as Young_Italy, Young_Germany, Sturm_und_Drang, the German_Youth
Movement, and other romantic_movements. By the end of the 19th century,
European intellectuals were disposed toward thinking of the world in
generational termsâin terms of youth rebellion and emancipation.[11]
Two important contributing factors to the change in mentality were the change
in the economic structure of society. Because of the rapid social and economic
change, young men particularly were less beholden to their fathers and family
authority than they had been. Greater social and economic mobility allowed them
to flout their authority to a much greater extent than had traditionally been
possible. Additionally, the skills and wisdom of fathers were often less
valuable than they had been due to technological and social change.[11] During
this time, the period between childhood and adulthood, usually spent at
university or in military service, was also increased for many people entering
white-collar jobs. This category of people was very influential in spreading
the ideas of youthful renewal.[11]
Another important factor was the breakdown of traditional social and regional
identifications. The spread of nationalism and many of the factors that created
it (a national press, linguistic homogenisation, public_education, suppression
of local particularities) encouraged a broader sense of belonging beyond local
affiliations. People thought of themselves increasingly as part of a society,
and this encouraged identification with groups beyond the local.[11]Auguste
Comte was the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to systematically
study generations. In Cours de philosophie positive Comte suggested that social
change is determined by generational change and in particular conflict between
successive generations.[12] As the members of a given generation age, their
"instinct of social conservation" becomes stronger, which inevitably and
necessarily brings them into conflict with the "normal attribute of
youth"âinnovation. Other important theorists of the 19th century were John
Stuart_Mill and Wilhelm_Dilthey.
Sociologist Karl_Mannheim was a seminal figure in the study of generations. He
elaborated a theory_of_generations in his 1923 essay The Problem of
Generations.[2] He suggested that there had been a division into two primary
schools of study of generations until that time. Firstly, positivists such as
Comte measured social change in designated life spans. Mannheim argued that
this reduced history to "a chronological table". The other school, the
"romantic-historical" was represented by Dilthey and Martin_Heidegger. This
school focused on the individual qualitative experience at the expense of
social context. Mannheim emphasised that the rapidity of social change in youth
was crucial to the formation of generations, and that not every generation
would come to see itself as distinct. In periods of rapid social change a
generation would be much more likely to develop a cohesive character. He also
believed that a number of distinct sub-generations could exist.[2]
According to Gilleard and Higgs, Mannheim identified three commonalities that a
generation shares:[13]
    * Shared temporal location â generational site or birth cohort
    * Shared historical location â generation as actuality or exposure to a
      common era
    * Shared sociocultural location â generational consciousness or
      "entelechy"
Authors William_Strauss and Neil_Howe developed the Strauss-Howe_generational
theory outlining what they saw as a pattern of generations repeating throughout
American history. This theory became quite influential with the public and
reignited an interest in the sociology of generations. This led to the creation
of an industry of consulting, publishing, and marketing in the field.[14] The
theory has alternatively been criticized by social scientists and journalists
who argue it is non-falsifiable, deterministic, and unsupported by rigorous
evidence.[15][16][17]
***** Generational theory[edit] *****
Birth dates of generations of the western world
While the concept of a generation has a long history and can be found in
ancient literature,[18] there are also psychological and sociological
dimensions in the sense of belonging and identity which may define a
generation. The concept of a generation can be used to locate particular birth
cohorts in specific historical and cultural circumstances, such as the "Baby
boomers".[18]
Historian Hans Jaeger shows that, during this long history, two schools of
thought coalesced regarding how generations form: the "pulse-rate hypothesis"
and the "imprint hypothesis."[19] According to the pulse-rate hypothesis, a
society's entire population can be divided into a series of non-overlapping
cohorts, each of which develops a unique "peer personality" because of the time
period in which each cohort came of age.[20] The movement of these cohorts from
one life-stage to the next creates a repeating cycle that shapes the history of
that society. Currently, the most prominent example of pulse-rate generational
theory is the Strauss-Howe_generational_theory; however, Jose_Ortega_y_Gasset
and Julian_Marias followed this approach before them.
Social scientists tend to reject the pulse-rate hypothesis because, as Jaeger
explains, "the concrete results of the theory of the universal pulse rate of
history are, of course, very modest. With a few exceptions, the same goes for
the partial pulse-rate theories. Since they generally gather data without any
knowledge of statistical principles, the authors are often least likely to
notice to what extent the jungle of names and numbers which they present lacks
any convincing organization according to generations."[21]
Social scientists follow the "imprint hypothesis" of generations, which can be
traced to Karl_Mannheim's theory_of_generations. According to the imprint
hypothesis, generations are only produced by specific historical events that
cause young people to perceive the world differently than their elders. Thus,
not everyone may be part of a generation; only those who share a unique social
and biographical experience of an important historical moment will become part
of a "generation as an actuality."[22] When following the imprint hypothesis,
social scientists face a number of challenges. They cannot accept the labels
and chronological boundaries of generations that come from the pulse-rate
hypothesis (like Generation X or Millennial); instead, the chronological
boundaries of generations must be determined inductively and who is part of the
generation must be determined through historical, quantitative, and qualitative
analysis.[23]
While all generations have similarities, there are differences among them as
well. A 2007 Pew_Research_Center report called "Millennials: Confident.
Connected. Open to Change" noted the challenge of studying generations:
"Generational analysis has a long and distinguished place in social science,
and we cast our lot with those scholars who believe it is not only possible,
but often highly illuminating, to search for the unique and distinctive
characteristics of any given age group of Americans. But we also know this is
not an exact science. We are mindful that there are as many differences in
attitudes, values, behaviors, and lifestyles within a generation as there are
between generations. But we believe this reality does not diminish the value of
generational analysis; it merely adds to its richness and complexity."[24]
Another element of generational theory is recognizing how youth experience
their generation, and how that changes based on where they reside in the world.
"Analyzing young people's experiences in place contributes to a deeper
understanding of the processes of individualization, inequality, and of
generation."[25] Being able to take a closer looks at youth cultures and
subcultures in different times and places adds an extra element to
understanding the everyday lives of youth. This allows a better understanding
of youth and the way generation and place play in their development.[26]
It is not where the birth cohort boundaries are drawn that is important, but
how individuals and societies interpret the boundaries and how divisions may
shape processes and outcomes. However, the practice of categorizing age cohorts
is useful to researchers for the purpose of constructing boundaries in their
work.[27]
***** Generational tension[edit] *****
Norman Ryder, writing in American_Sociological_Review in 1965, shed light on
the sociology of the discord between generations by suggesting that society
"persists despite the mortality of its individual members, through processes of
demographic metabolism and particularly the annual infusion of birth cohorts".
He argued that generations may sometimes be a "threat to stability" but at the
same time they represent "the opportunity for social transformation".[28] Ryder
attempted to understand the dynamics at play between generations.
Amanda Grenier, in a 2007 essay published in Journal_of_Social_Issues, offered
another source of explanation for why generational tensions exist. Grenier
asserted that generations develop their own linguistic models that contribute
to misunderstanding between age cohorts, "Different ways of speaking exercised
by older and younger people exist, and may be partially explained by social
historical reference points, culturally determined experiences, and individual
interpretations".[29]
Karl_Mannheim, in his 1952 book Essays_on_the_Sociology_of_Knowledge asserted
the belief that people are shaped through lived experiences as a result of
social change. Howe and Strauss also have written on the similarities of people
within a generation being attributed to social change. Based on the way these
lived experiences shape a generation in regard to values, the result is that
the new generation will challenge the older generation's values, resulting in
tension. This challenge between generations and the tension that arises is a
defining point for understanding generations and what separates them.[30]
***** List of generations[edit] *****
**** Western world[edit] ****
This photograph depicts four generations of one family: a baby boy, his mother,
his maternal grandmother, and his maternal great-grandmother. (2008)
"Western_world" can be taken to include Europe, America, Australia and New
Zealand. Many variations may exist within these regions, both geographically
and culturally, which means that the list is broadly indicative, but very
general. The contemporary characterization of these cohorts used in media and
advertising borrows, in part, from the StraussâHowe_generational_theory
[citation_needed] and generally follows the logic of the pulse-rate hypothesis.
[31]
    * The Lost_Generation, also known as the Generation of 1914 in Europe,[32]
      is a term originating with Gertrude_Stein to describe those who fought in
      World_War_I. The members of the lost generation were typically born
      between 1883 and 1900. All known members of this generation are now
      deceased.
    * The Greatest_Generation, also known as the "G.I. Generation,"[33] are
      those who include the veterans who fought in World_War_II. They were born
      from around 1901 to 1927[34] and came of age during the Great_Depression.
      Journalist Tom_Brokaw wrote about American members of this cohort in his
      book, The_Greatest_Generation, which popularized the term.[35]
    * The Silent_Generation, also known as the Lucky Few, were born from
      approximately 1925 to 1942.[36] It includes some who fought in World_War
      II, most of those who fought the Korean_War and many during the Vietnam
      War.
    * Baby_boomers, also known as Generation W[37] or the Me_Generation, are
      the generation that were born mostly following World_War_II, typically
      born from 1946 to 1964. Increased birth rates were observed during the
      postâWorld_War_II_baby_boom making them a relatively large demographic
      cohort.[38][39]
    * Generation_X, commonly abbreviated to Gen X, is the generation following
      the baby boomers. Demographers and researchers typically use starting
      birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960s and ending birth years in
      the early 1980s. The term has also been used in different times and
      places for a number of different subcultures or countercultures since the
      1950s.
          o In the U.S., some called Xers the "baby bust" generation because of
            a drop in birth rates following the baby boom.[40] The drop in
            fertility rates in America began in the late 1950s. But according
            to authors William Strauss and Neil Howe (who use a twenty year
            span from 1961 to 1981 for their birth years), by 1991 there were
            approximately 88.5 million Xers in the U.S.[41]
    * Millennials, also known as Generation Y,[42] are the cohort of people
      following Generation X. Demographers and researchers typically use the
      early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid 1990s to early 2000s as
      ending birth years. According to Pew_Research, the Millennials will
      surpass the Baby Boomers in numbers in the U.S. in 2019, with an
      anticipated 72 million Boomers and 73 million Millennials.[43]
    * Generation_Z is the cohort of people born after the Millennials.
      Demographers and researchers typically use the mid-1990s to early-2000s
      as starting birth years.[44] There is little consensus regarding ending
      birth years.
**** Other areas[edit] ****
    * In Armenia, people born after the country's independence from the Soviet
      Union in 1991 are known as the "Independence generation".
    * In the Czech_Republic and Slovakia, the generation of people born in
      Czechoslovakia during the baby_boom which started in the early 1970s,
      during the period of "normalization" are called "HusÃ¡k's_children". The
      generation was named after the President and long-term Communist leader
      of Czechoslovakia, GustÃ¡v_HusÃ¡k. [45]
    * In the People's_Republic_of_China, the "Post-80s" (Chinese:
      å«é¶åä¸ä»£ or å«é¶å) (born-after-1980 generation) are those who
      were born in the 1980s in urban areas of Mainland China. Growing up in
      modern China, the Post-80s has been characterised by its optimism for the
      future, newfound excitement for consumerism and entrepreneurship and
      acceptance of its historic role in transforming modern China into an
      economic power.[46] There is also the similarly named Post-90s (Chinese:
      ä¹é¶å), referring to modern teenagers and college students.[citation
      needed] A broader generational classification would be the "one-child
      generation" born between the introduction of the one-child_policy in 1980
      and its softening into a "two-child policy" in 2013. The lack of siblings
      has had profound psychological effects on this generation, such as egoism
      due to always being at the centre of parents' attention as well as the
      stress of having to be the sole provider once the parents retire.
    * People born post-1980s in Hong_Kong are for the most part different from
      the same generation in mainland China.[47] The term "Post-80s"
      (å«åå¾) came into use in Hong_Kong between 2009 and 2010,
      particularly during the opposition_to_the_Guangzhou-Hong_Kong_Express
      Rail_Link, during which a group of young activists came to the forefront
      of Hong Kong's political scene.[48] They are said to be "post-
      materialist" in outlook, and they are particularly vocal in issues such
      as urban development, culture and heritage, and political reform. Their
      campaigns include the fight for the preservation of Lee_Tung_Street, the
      Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier, Choi Yuen Tsuen Village, real
      political reform (on 23 June), and a citizen-oriented Kowloon West Art
      district. Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as anti-
      colonialism, sustainable_development, and democracy.
    * In Israel, where most Ashkenazi_Jews born before the end of World_War_II
      were Holocaust_survivors, children of survivors and people who survived
      as babies are sometimes referred to as the "second generation (of
      Holocaust survivors)" (Hebrew: ×××¨ ×©× × ×× ××¦××× ×©×××, dor
      sheni lenitsolei shoah; or more often just ×××¨ ×©× × ××©×××, dor
      sheni lashoah, literally "second generation to the Holocaust"). This term
      is particularly common in the context of mental, social, and political
      implications of the individual and national transgenerational_trauma
      caused by the_Holocaust. Some researchers have also found signs of trauma
      in third-generation Holocaust survivors.[49]
    * In Germany, generations widely follow the Western world pattern but have
      many aspects of different VergangenheitsbewÃ¤ltigung. In German history
      the start and abolition of Gleichschaltung in mass_movements (Nazi
      Hitlerjugend and later communist Free_German_Youth) also shaped
      generations.[citation_needed] The baby boomer generation was heavily
      challenging their parents and relatives with their past in Nazi_Germany
      and in World_War_II as well as their (individual) responsibility_for_the
      Holocaust but also the survival of the Third Reich in (West) German
      administration, science, legislation and culture due to claimed
      unsuccessful denazification. It formed German_student_movement which
      translated West Germany in some aspects. Later, Generation Golf (named
      after the VW_Golf) is very similar to Generation X describing the
      generation that was raised in late West_Germany with the specific
      background of the German separation, then deadlocked German_question and
      cold-war_threats.[citation_needed] The East German generation which was
      born in the mid-eighties and later was little influenced and
      indoctrinated by East_German Communist education system and not captured
      by Free_German_Youth. Children in the New_states_of_Germany who were not
      older than seven years during German_Reunification are often in a
      stronger cultural contrast to their parents and relatives while those who
      were slightly older saw a massive change in their school system, syllabi
      and breakdown of the youth welfare but also unexpected opportunities and
      chances in modern_Germany.[citation_needed]
    * In Poland, two important groups with a shared generational identity are
      recognized: the Generation_of_Columbuses, who were born during the brief
      period of Polish independence in the interbellum and survived World War
      II, and the "generation of free Poland", born after the dissolution of
      communism in 1989.[citation_needed]
    * In Romania, all people who were born in 1989 are called the Revolution
      Generation because communism fell that year and Romania experienced a
      violent_revolution that ended the communist regime of Nicolae_CeauÈescu
      and brought democracy to Romania.[citation_needed] There was also a
      demographic called "DecreÈeii", representing those that were born during
      the effect of the communism regime applied Decree 770, which lasted
      between 1967 and 1989.
    * In Singapore, people born between 1950 and 1986 are referred to as the
      "Pioneer Generation"
    * In South_Africa, people born after the first_democratic_election held
      after apartheid are often referred to in media as the "born-free
      generation".[50][51][52]
    * In South_Korea, generational cohorts are often defined around the
      democratization of the country, with various schemes suggested including
      names such as the "democratization generation", 386_generation[53][54]
      (named after Intel_386 computer in the 1990s to describe people in their
      late 30s and early 40s who were born in the 1960s, and attended
      university/college in the 1980s, also called the "June 3, 1987
      generation"), that witnessed the June uprising, the "April 19 generation"
      (that struggled against the Syngman_Rhee regime in 1960), the "June 3
      generation" (that struggled against the normalization treaty with Japan
      in 1964), the "1969 generation" (that struggled against the
      constitutional revision allowing three presidential terms), and the shin-
      se-dae ("new") generation.[54][55][56] The term Shin-se-dae generation
      refers to the generation following Millennials in the Korean language.
      The Shin-se-dae generation are mostly free from ideological or political
      bias.[57]
    * In India, generations tend to follow a pattern similar to the broad
      Western model, although there are still major differences, especially in
      the older generations.[58] One interpretation sees India's_independence
      in 1947 as India's major generational shift. People born in the 1930s and
      1940s tended to be loyal to the new state and tended to adhere to
      "traditional" divisions of society. Indian "boomers", those born after
      independence and into the early 1960s, witnessed events like the Indian
      Emergency between 1975 and 1977 which made a number of them somewhat
      skeptical of government. Gen Xers experienced India's economic ascendance
      and are more comfortable with diverse perspectives. Generation Y
      continues this pattern.[citation_needed]
    * In the Philippines, people also identify with Western terms such as
      "Generation X" and "Millennials", with Filipinos born before or during
      the Second_World_War (as well as those living as adults in that period)
      constituting an unofficial generation. "Martial Law Babies" are generally
      defined as people born in the time period between the imposition of
      Martial_Law by President Ferdinand_Marcos on 21 September 1972 and its
      formal lifting in January 1981.[59] The term is sometimes extended to
      anyone born within Marcos' entire 21-year_rule, while those born after
      the 1986_People_Power_Revolution that toppled the regime are sometimes
      termed "EDSA Babies".[60]
    * In Taiwan, the term Strawberry_generation refers to Taiwanese people born
      after 1981 who "bruise easily" like strawberries â meaning they can not
      withstand social pressure or work hard like their parents' generation;
      the term refers to people who are insubordinate, spoiled, selfish,
      arrogant, and sluggish in work.
    * 9X_Generation is a Vietnamese term for people born during the 1990s.
    * In Russia characteristics of Russian generations are determined by
      fateful historical event that significantly changes either the
      foundations of the life of the country as a whole or the rules of life in
      a certain period of time. Are named and given descriptions of Russian
      generations: the Generation of Winners,[61] the generation of the Cold
      War, the generation of Perestroika, the first non-Soviet generation (the
      children of Perestroika, the Witnesses_of_Perestroika), the digital
      generation.[62]
***** Other terminology[edit] *****
The term generation is sometimes applied to a cultural movement, or more
narrowly defined group than an entire demographic. Some examples include:
    * The Stolen_Generations, refers to children of Aboriginal_Australians and
      Torres_Strait_Islander (AATSI) descent, who were removed from their
      families by the Australian Federal and State government agencies and
      church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments between
      approximately 1869 and 1969.
    * The Beat_Generation, refers to a popular American cultural movement
      widely cited by social scholars as having laid the foundation of the pro-
      active American counterculture_of_the_1960s. It consisted of Americans
      born between the two world wars who came of age in the rise of the
      automobile era, and the surrounding accessibility they brought to the
      culturally diverse, yet geographically broad and separated nation.[63]
    * Generation_Jones is a term coined by Jonathan_Pontell to describe the
      cohort of people born between 1954 and 1965. The term is used primarily
      in English-speaking_countries.[64][65] Pontell defined Generation Jones
      as referring to the second half of the postâWorld_War_II_baby_boom.[66]
      The term also includes first-wave Generation_X.
    * MTV_Generation, a term referring to the adolescents and young adults of
      the 1980s and early 1990s who were heavily influenced by the MTV
      television channel. It is often used synonymously with Generation_X.[67]

    * In Europe, a variety of terms have emerged in different countries
      particularly hard hit following the financial_crisis_of_2007â2008 to
      designate young people with limited employment and career prospects.[70]
      The Generation of 500 is a term popularized by the Greek_mass_media and
      refers to educated Greek twixters of urban centers who generally fail to
      establish a career. Young adults are usually forced into underemployment
      in temporary and occasional jobs, unrelated to their educational
      background, and receive the minimum allowable base salary of â¬500. This
      generation evolved in circumstances leading to the Greek_debt_crisis and
      participated in the 2010â2011_Greek_protests.[71] In Spain, they are
      referred to as the mileurista (for â¬1,000),[72] in France "The
      Precarious Generation", and in Italy also the generation of 1,000 euros.
    * Xennials, Oregon Trail Generation (based on a_pioneering_video_game that
      only members of the generation can recall), and Generation Catalano are
      terms used to describe individuals born during Generation X/Millennial
      cusp years, typically late 1970s to early 1980s.[73][74][75][76][77]
