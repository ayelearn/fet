Subsidence is the sudden sinking or gradual downward settling of the ground's
surface with little or no horizontal motion. The definition of subsidence is
not restricted by the rate, magnitude, or area involved in the downward
movement. It may be caused by natural processes or by human activities. The
former include various karst phenomena, thawing of permafrost, consolidation,
oxidation of organic soils, slow crustal warping (isostatic_adjustment), normal
faulting, caldera subsidence, or withdrawal of fluid lava from beneath a solid
crust. The human activities include sub-surface mining or extraction of
underground fluids, e. g. petroleum, natural_gas, or groundwater.[1][2] Ground
subsidence is of global concern to geologists, geotechnical_engineers,
surveyors, engineers, urban_planners, landowners, and the public in general.[3]

***** Dissolution of limestone[edit] *****
Subsidence frequently causes major problems in karst terrains, where
dissolution of limestone by fluid flow in the subsurface creates voids (i.e.,
caves). If the roof of a void becomes too weak, it can collapse and the
overlying rock and earth will fall into the space, causing subsidence at the
surface. This type of subsidence can cause sinkholes which can be many hundreds
of meters deep.
***** Mining[edit] *****
Several types of sub-surface_mining, and specifically methods which
intentionally cause the extracted void to collapse (such as pillar extraction,
longwall_mining and any metalliferous_mining method which uses "caving" such as
"block caving" or "sub-level caving") will result in surface subsidence.
Mining-induced subsidence is relatively predictable in its magnitude,
manifestation and extent, except where a sudden pillar or near-surface
underground tunnel collapse occurs (usually very old workings[4]). Mining-
induced subsidence is nearly always very localized to the surface above the
mined area, plus a margin around the outside.[5] The vertical magnitude of the
subsidence itself typically does not cause problems, except in the case of
drainage (including natural drainage)ârather, it is the associated surface
compressive and tensile strains, curvature, tilts and horizontal displacement
that are the cause of the worst damage to the natural environment, buildings
and infrastructure.[6]
Where mining activity is planned, mining-induced subsidence can be successfully
managed if there is co-operation from all of the stakeholders. This is
accomplished through a combination of careful mine planning, the taking of
preventive measures, and the carrying out of repairs post-mining.
Types of ground subsidence
***** Extraction of natural gas[edit] *****
If natural_gas is extracted from a natural_gas_field the initial pressure (up
to 60 MPa (600 bar)) in the field will drop over the years. The pressure helps
support the soil layers above the field. If the gas is extracted, the
overburden_pressure sediment compacts and may lead to earthquakes and
subsidence at the ground level.
Since exploitation of the Slochteren (Netherlands) gas field started in the
late 1960s the ground level over a 250 kmÂ² area has dropped by a current
maximum of 30 cm.[7]
***** Earthquake[edit] *****
Land subsidence can occur in various ways during an earthquake. Large areas of
land can subside drastically during an earthquake because of offset along fault
lines. Land subsidence can also occur as a result of settling and compacting of
unconsolidated sediment from the shaking of an earthquake.[8]
The Geospatial_Information_Authority_of_Japan reported immediate subsidence
caused by the 2011_TÅhoku_earthquake.[9] In Northern Japan, subsidence of
0.50 m (1.64 ft) was observed on the coast of the Pacific_Ocean in Miyako,
TÅhoku, while Rikuzentakata,_Iwate measured 0.84 m (2.75 ft). In the south at
SÅma,_Fukushima, 0.29 m (0.95 ft) was observed. The maximum amount of
subsidence was 1.2 m (3.93 ft), coupled with horizontal diastrophism of up to
5.3 m (17.3 ft) on the Oshika_Peninsula in Miyagi_Prefecture.[10]
***** Groundwater-related subsidence[edit] *****
San_Joaquin_Valley subsidence
Main article: Groundwater-related_subsidence
Groundwater-related subsidence is the subsidence (or the sinking) of land
resulting from groundwater extraction. It is a growing problem in the
developing world as cities increase in population and water use, without
adequate pumping regulation and enforcement. One estimate has 80% of serious
land subsidence problems associated with the excessive extraction of
groundwater,[11] making it a growing problem throughout the world.
Groundwater fluctuations can also indirectly affect the decay of organic
material. The habitation of lowlands, such as coastal or delta plains, requires
drainage. The resulting aeration of the soil leads to the oxidation of its
organic components, such as peat, and this decomposition process may cause
significant land subsidence. This applies especially when groundwater levels
are periodically adapted to subsidence, in order to maintain desired
unsaturated_zone depths, exposing more and more peat to oxygen. In addition to
this, drained soils consolidate as a result of increased effective_stress.[12]
[13] In this way, land subsidence has the potential of becoming self-
perpetuating, having rates up to 5 cm/yr. Water_management used to be tuned
primarily to factors such as crop optimization but, to varying extents,
avoiding subsidence has come to be taken into account as well.
***** Faulting induced[edit] *****
When differential stresses exist in the Earth, these can be accommodated either
by geological_faulting in the brittle crust, or by ductile flow in the hotter
and more fluid mantle. Where faults occur, absolute subsidence may occur in the
hanging wall of normal faults. In reverse, or thrust, faults, relative
subsidence may be measured in the footwall.
***** Isostatic subsidence[edit] *****
The crust floats buoyantly in the asthenosphere, with a ratio of mass below the
"surface" in proportion to its own density and the density of the
asthenosphere. If mass is added to a local area of the crust (e.g., through
deposition), the crust subsides to compensate and maintain isostatic_balance.
The opposite of isostatic subsidence is known as isostatic reboundâthe action
of the crust returning (sometimes over periods of thousands of years) to a
state of isostacy, such as after the melting of large ice sheets or the drying-
up of large lakes after the last ice age. Lake Bonneville is a famous example
of isostatic rebound. Due to the weight of the water once held in the lake, the
earth's crust subsided nearly 200 feet (61 m) to maintain equilibrium. When the
lake dried up, the crust rebounded. Today at Lake_Bonneville, the center of the
former lake is about 200 feet (61 m) higher than the former lake edges.
***** Seasonal effects[edit] *****
See also: Expansive_clay
Many soils contain significant proportions of clay. Because of the very small
particle size, they are affected by changes in soil moisture content. Seasonal
drying of the soil results in a lowering of both the volume and the surface of
the soil. If building foundations are above the level reached by seasonal
drying, they move, possibly resulting in damage to the building in the form of
tapering cracks.
Trees and other vegetation can have a significant local effect on seasonal
drying of soils. Over a number of years, a cumulative drying occurs as the tree
grows. That can lead to the opposite of subsidence, known as heave or swelling
of the soil, when the tree declines or is felled. As the cumulative moisture
deficit is reversed, which can last up to 25 years, the surface level around
the tree will rise and expand laterally. That often damages buildings unless
the foundations have been strengthened or designed to cope with the effect.
