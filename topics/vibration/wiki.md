Vibration is a mechanical phenomenon whereby oscillations occur about an
equilibrium_point. The word comes from Latin vibrationem ("shaking,
brandishing"). The oscillations may be periodic, such as the motion of a
pendulumâor random, such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.
Vibration can be desirable: for example, the motion of a tuning_fork, the reed
in a woodwind_instrument or harmonica, a mobile_phone, or the cone of a
loudspeaker.
In many cases, however, vibration is undesirable, wasting energy and creating
unwanted sound. For example, the vibrational motions of engines, electric
motors, or any mechanical_device in operation are typically unwanted. Such
vibrations could be caused by imbalances in the rotating parts, uneven
friction, or the meshing of gear teeth. Careful designs usually minimize
unwanted vibrations.
The studies of sound and vibration are closely related. Sound, or pressure
waves, are generated by vibrating structures (e.g. vocal_cords); these pressure
waves can also induce the vibration of structures (e.g. ear_drum). Hence,
attempts to reduce noise are often related to issues of vibration.

***** Types of vibration[edit] *****
Free vibration occurs when a mechanical system is set in motion with an initial
input and allowed to vibrate freely. Examples of this type of vibration are
pulling a child back on a swing and letting it go, or hitting a tuning fork and
letting it ring. The mechanical system vibrates at one or more of its natural
frequencies and damps down to motionlessness.
Forced vibration is when a time-varying disturbance (load, displacement or
velocity) is applied to a mechanical system. The disturbance can be a periodic
and steady-state input, a transient input, or a random input. The periodic
input can be a harmonic or a non-harmonic disturbance. Examples of these types
of vibration include a washing machine shaking due to an imbalance,
transportation vibration caused by an engine or uneven road, or the vibration
of a building during an earthquake. For linear systems, the frequency of the
steady-state vibration response resulting from the application of a periodic,
harmonic input is equal to the frequency of the applied force or motion, with
the response magnitude being dependent on the actual mechanical system.
Damped vibration: When the energy of a vibrating system is gradually dissipated
by friction and other resistances, the vibrations are said to be damped. The
vibrations gradually reduce or change in frequency or intensity or cease and
the system rests in its equilibrium position. An example of this type of
vibration is the vehicular_suspension dampened by the shock_absorber.
***** Vibration testing[edit] *****
Vibration testing is accomplished by introducing a forcing function into a
structure, usually with some type of shaker. Alternately, a DUT (device under
test) is attached to the "table" of a shaker. Vibration testing is performed to
examine the response of a device under test (DUT) to a defined vibration
environment. The measured response may be fatigue life, resonant frequencies or
squeak and rattle sound output (NVH). Squeak and rattle testing is performed
with a special type of quiet shaker that produces very low sound levels while
under operation.
For relatively low frequency forcing, servohydraulic (electrohydraulic) shakers
are used. For higher frequencies, electrodynamic shakers are used. Generally,
one or more "input" or "control" points located on the DUT-side of a fixture is
kept at a specified acceleration.[1] Other "response" points experience maximum
vibration level (resonance) or minimum vibration level (anti-resonance). It is
often desirable to achieve anti-resonance to keep a system from becoming too
noisy, or to reduce strain on certain parts due to vibration modes caused by
specific vibration frequencies .[2]
The most common types of vibration testing services conducted by vibration test
labs are Sinusoidal and Random. Sine (one-frequency-at-a-time) tests are
performed to survey the structural response of the device under test (DUT). A
random (all frequencies at once) test is generally considered to more closely
replicate a real world environment, such as road inputs to a moving automobile.
Most vibration testing is conducted in a 'single DUT axis' at a time, even
though most real-world vibration occurs in various axes simultaneously. MIL-
STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple exciter
testing. The vibration test fixture used to attach the DUT to the shaker table
must be designed for the frequency range of the vibration test spectrum.
Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets
a fixture design that is free of resonances in the test frequency range. This
becomes more difficult as the DUT gets larger and as the test frequency
increases. In these cases multi-point control strategies can mitigate some of
the resonances that may be present in the future. Devices specifically designed
to trace or record vibrations are called vibroscopes.

Vibration Analysis (VA), applied in an industrial or maintenance environment
aims to reduce maintenance costs and equipment downtime by detecting equipment
faults.[3][4] VA is a key component of a condition_monitoring (CM) program, and
is often referred to as predictive_maintenance (PdM).[5] Most commonly VA is
used to detect faults in rotating equipment (Fans, Motors, Pumps, and Gearboxes
etc.) such as Unbalance, Misalignment, rolling element bearing faults and
resonance conditions.
VA can use the units of Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration displayed as a
time_waveform (TWF), but most commonly the spectrum is used, derived from a
fast_Fourier_transform of the TWF. The vibration spectrum provides important
frequency information that can pinpoint the faulty component.
The fundamentals of vibration analysis can be understood by studying the simple
Mass-spring-damper model. Indeed, even a complex structure such as an
automobile body can be modeled as a "summation" of simple mass–spring–damper
models. The mass–spring–damper model is an example of a simple_harmonic
oscillator. The mathematics used to describe its behavior is identical to other
simple harmonic oscillators such as the RLC_circuit.
Note: This article does not include the step-by-step mathematical derivations,
but focuses on major vibration analysis equations and concepts. Please refer to
the references at the end of the article for detailed derivations.
**** Free vibration without damping[edit] ****
[Simple_Mass_Spring_Model]
To start the investigation of the massâspringâdamper assume the damping is
negligible and that there is no external force applied to the mass (i.e. free
vibration). The force applied to the mass by the spring is proportional to the
amount the spring is stretched "x" (assuming the spring is already compressed
due to the weight of the mass). The proportionality constant, k, is the
stiffness of the spring and has units of force/distance (e.g. lbf/in or N/m).
The negative sign indicates that the force is always opposing the motion of the
mass attached to it:
          F  s   = &#x2212; k x .    {\displaystyle F_{s}=-kx.\!}  [
      F_s=- k x. \!
      ]
The force generated by the mass is proportional to the acceleration of the mass
as given by Newton's_second_law_of_motion:
         &#x03A3; &#xA0; F = m a = m    x &#x00A8;    = m     d  2   x   d  t
      2      .   {\displaystyle \Sigma \ F=ma=m{\ddot {x}}=m{\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^
      {2}}}.}  [
      \Sigma\ F = ma = m \ddot{x} = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}.
      ]
The sum of the forces on the mass then generates this ordinary_differential
equation:     &#xA0; m    x &#x00A8;    + k x = 0.   {\displaystyle \ m{\ddot
{x}}+kx=0.}  [  \ m \ddot{x} + k x = 0.]
Simple harmonic motion of the massâspring system
Assuming that the initiation of vibration begins by stretching the spring by
the distance of A and releasing, the solution to the above equation that
describes the motion of mass is:
         x ( t ) = A cos &#x2061; ( 2 &#x03C0;  f  n   t ) .    {\displaystyle
      x(t)=A\cos(2\pi f_{n}t).\!}  [
      x(t) =  A \cos (2 \pi f_n  t). \!
      ]
This solution says that it will oscillate with simple_harmonic_motion that has
an amplitude of A and a frequency of fn. The number fn is called the undamped
natural frequency. For the simple massâspring system, fn is defined as:
          f  n   =   1  2 &#x03C0;       k m    .    {\displaystyle f_{n}={1
      \over {2\pi }}{\sqrt {k \over m}}.\!}  [
      f_n = {1\over {2 \pi}} \sqrt{k \over m}. \!
      ]
Note: angular_frequency Ï (Ï=2 Ï f) with the units of radians per second is
often used in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally
converted to ordinary_frequency (units of Hz or equivalently cycles per second)
when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness of the system
is known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system
vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system
has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This
simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more
complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula
explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels
â³softerâ³ than unloadedâthe mass has increased, reducing the natural
frequency of the system.
*** What causes the system to vibrate: from conservation of energy point of
view[edit] ***
Vibrational motion could be understood in terms of conservation_of_energy. In
the above example the spring has been extended by a value of x and therefore
some potential_energy (       1 2    k  x  2     {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}
{2}}kx^{2}}  [\tfrac {1}{2} k x^2]) is stored in the spring. Once released, the
spring tends to return to its un-stretched state (which is the minimum
potential energy state) and in the process accelerates the mass. At the point
where the spring has reached its un-stretched state all the potential energy
that we supplied by stretching it has been transformed into kinetic_energy
(       1 2    m  v  2     {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}  [\tfrac {1}
{2} m v^2]). The mass then begins to decelerate because it is now compressing
the spring and in the process transferring the kinetic energy back to its
potential. Thus oscillation of the spring amounts to the transferring back and
forth of the kinetic energy into potential energy. In this simple model the
mass continues to oscillate forever at the same magnitudeâbut in a real
system, damping always dissipates the energy, eventually bringing the spring to
rest.
**** Free vibration with damping[edit] ****
Massâspringâdamper model
When a "viscous" damper is added to the model this outputs a force that is
proportional to the velocity of the mass. The damping is called viscous because
it models the effects of a fluid within an object. The proportionality constant
c is called the damping coefficient and has units of Force over velocity
(lbfâs/in or Nâs/m).
          F  d   = &#x2212; c v = &#x2212; c    x &#x02D9;    = &#x2212; c    d
      x   d t    .   {\displaystyle F_{\text{d}}=-cv=-c{\dot {x}}=-c{\frac {dx}
      {dt}}.}  [{\displaystyle F_{\text{d}}=-cv=-c{\dot {x}}=-c{\frac {dx}
      {dt}}.}]
Summing the forces on the mass results in the following ordinary differential
equation:
         m    x &#x00A8;    + c    x &#x02D9;    + k x = 0.   {\displaystyle m
      {\ddot {x}}+c{\dot {x}}+kx=0.}  [{\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+c{\dot
      {x}}+kx=0.}]
The solution to this equation depends on the amount of damping. If the damping
is small enough, the system still vibratesâbut eventually, over time, stops
vibrating. This case is called underdamping, which is important in vibration
analysis. If damping is increased just to the point where the system no longer
oscillates, the system has reached the point of critical_damping. If the
damping is increased past critical damping, the system is overdamped. The value
that the damping coefficient must reach for critical damping in the mass-
spring-damper_model is:
          c  c   = 2   km   .   {\displaystyle c_{\text{c}}=2{\sqrt {\text
      {km}}}.}  [{\displaystyle c_{\text{c}}=2{\sqrt {\text{km}}}.}]
To characterize the amount of damping in a system a ratio called the damping
ratio (also known as damping factor and % critical damping) is used. This
damping ratio is just a ratio of the actual damping over the amount of damping
required to reach critical damping. The formula for the damping ratio
(    &#x03B6;   {\displaystyle \zeta }  [\zeta ]) of the mass-spring-damper
model is:
         &#x03B6; =   c  2   km      .   {\displaystyle \zeta ={c \over 2{\sqrt
      {\text{km}}}}.}  [{\displaystyle \zeta ={c \over 2{\sqrt {\text{km}}}}.}]
For example, metal structures (e.g., airplane fuselages, engine crankshafts)
have damping factors less than 0.05, while automotive suspensions are in the
range of 0.2–0.3. The solution to the underdamped_system for the mass-spring-
damper model is the following:
         x ( t ) = X  e  &#x2212; &#x03B6;  &#x03C9;  n   t   cos &#x2061;
      (    1 &#x2212;  &#x03B6;  2      &#x03C9;  n   t &#x2212; &#x03D5;  )  ,
      &#x03C9;  n   = 2 &#x03C0;  f  n   .   {\displaystyle x(t)=Xe^{-\zeta
      \omega _{n}t}\cos \left({\sqrt {1-\zeta ^{2}}}\omega _{n}t-\phi
      \right),\qquad \omega _{n}=2\pi f_{n}.}  [{\displaystyle x(t)=Xe^{-\zeta
      \omega _{n}t}\cos \left({\sqrt {1-\zeta ^{2}}}\omega _{n}t-\phi
      \right),\qquad \omega _{n}=2\pi f_{n}.}]
Free vibration with 0.1 and 0.3 damping ratio
The value of X, the initial magnitude, and     &#x03D5; ,   {\displaystyle \phi
,}  [ \phi, ] the phase_shift, are determined by the amount the spring is
stretched. The formulas for these values can be found in the references.
*** Damped and undamped natural frequencies[edit] ***
The major points to note from the solution are the exponential term and the
cosine function. The exponential term defines how quickly the system
âdampsâ down â the larger the damping ratio, the quicker it damps to
zero. The cosine function is the oscillating portion of the solution, but the
frequency of the oscillations is different from the undamped case.
The frequency in this case is called the "damped natural frequency",      f  d
,   {\displaystyle f_{\text{d}},}  [{\displaystyle f_{\text{d}},}] and is
related to the undamped natural frequency by the following formula:
          f  d   =  f  n     1 &#x2212;  &#x03B6;  2     .   {\displaystyle f_
      {\text{d}}=f_{n}{\sqrt {1-\zeta ^{2}}}.}  [{\displaystyle f_{\text{d}}=f_
      {n}{\sqrt {1-\zeta ^{2}}}.}]
The damped natural frequency is less than the undamped natural frequency, but
for many practical cases the damping ratio is relatively small and hence the
difference is negligible. Therefore, the damped and undamped description are
often dropped when stating the natural frequency (e.g. with 0.1 damping ratio,
the damped natural frequency is only 1% less than the undamped).
The plots to the side present how 0.1 and 0.3 damping ratios effect how the
system âringsâ down over time. What is often done in practice is to
experimentally measure the free vibration after an impact (for example by a
hammer) and then determine the natural frequency of the system by measuring the
rate of oscillation, as well as the damping ratio by measuring the rate of
decay. The natural frequency and damping ratio are not only important in free
vibration, but also characterize how a system behaves under forced vibration.

**** Forced vibration with damping[edit] ****
The behavior of the spring mass damper model varies with the addition of a
harmonic force. A force of this type could, for example, be generated by a
rotating imbalance.
         F =  F  0   sin &#x2061; ( 2 &#x03C0; f t ) .    {\displaystyle F=F_
      {0}\sin(2\pi ft).\!}  [{\displaystyle F=F_{0}\sin(2\pi ft).\!}]
Summing the forces on the mass results in the following ordinary differential
equation:
         m    x &#x00A8;    + c    x &#x02D9;    + k x =  F  0   sin &#x2061;
      ( 2 &#x03C0; f t ) .   {\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+c{\dot {x}}+kx=F_
      {0}\sin(2\pi ft).}  [{\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+c{\dot {x}}+kx=F_{0}\sin
      (2\pi ft).}]
The steady_state solution of this problem can be written as:
         x ( t ) = X sin &#x2061; ( 2 &#x03C0; f t + &#x03D5; ) .
      {\displaystyle x(t)=X\sin(2\pi ft+\phi ).\!}  [{\displaystyle x(t)=X\sin
      (2\pi ft+\phi ).\!}]
The result states that the mass will oscillate at the same frequency, f, of the
applied force, but with a phase shift     &#x03D5; .   {\displaystyle \phi .}
[ \phi. ]
The amplitude of the vibration âXâ is defined by the following formula.
         X =    F  0   k     1   ( 1 &#x2212;  r  2    )  2   + ( 2 &#x03B6; r
      )  2       .   {\displaystyle X={F_{0} \over k}{1 \over {\sqrt {(1-r^
      {2})^{2}+(2\zeta r)^{2}}}}.}  [X= {F_0 \over k} {1 \over \sqrt{(1-r^2)^2
      + (2 \zeta r)^2}}.]
Where ârâ is defined as the ratio of the harmonic force frequency over the
undamped natural frequency of the mass–spring–damper model.
         r =   f  f  n     .   {\displaystyle r={\frac {f}{f_{n}}}.}  [r=\frac
      {f}{f_n}.]
The phase shift,     &#x03D5; ,   {\displaystyle \phi ,}  [\phi,] is defined by
the following formula.
         &#x03D5; = arctan &#x2061;  (    &#x2212; 2 &#x03B6; r   1 &#x2212;  r
      2      )  .   {\displaystyle \phi =\arctan \left({\frac {-2\zeta r}{1-r^
      {2}}}\right).}  [{\displaystyle \phi =\arctan \left({\frac {-2\zeta r}{1-
      r^{2}}}\right).}]
[Forced_Vibration_Response]
The plot of these functions, called "the frequency response of the system",
presents one of the most important features in forced vibration. In a lightly
damped system when the forcing frequency nears the natural frequency (    r
&#x2248; 1   {\displaystyle r\approx 1}  [r \approx 1 ]) the amplitude of the
vibration can get extremely high. This phenomenon is called resonance
(subsequently the natural frequency of a system is often referred to as the
resonant frequency). In rotor bearing systems any rotational speed that excites
a resonant frequency is referred to as a critical_speed.
If resonance occurs in a mechanical system it can be very harmful â leading
to eventual failure of the system. Consequently, one of the major reasons for
vibration analysis is to predict when this type of resonance may occur and then
to determine what steps to take to prevent it from occurring. As the amplitude
plot shows, adding damping can significantly reduce the magnitude of the
vibration. Also, the magnitude can be reduced if the natural frequency can be
shifted away from the forcing frequency by changing the stiffness or mass of
the system. If the system cannot be changed, perhaps the forcing frequency can
be shifted (for example, changing the speed of the machine generating the
force).
The following are some other points in regards to the forced vibration shown in
the frequency response plots.
    * At a given frequency ratio, the amplitude of the vibration, X, is
      directly proportional to the amplitude of the force      F  0
      {\displaystyle F_{0}}  [F_0 ] (e.g. if you double the force, the
      vibration doubles)
    * With little or no damping, the vibration is in phase with the forcing
      frequency when the frequency ratio r < 1 and 180 degrees out of phase
      when the frequency ratio r > 1
    * When r âª 1 the amplitude is just the deflection of the spring under the
      static force      F  0   .   {\displaystyle F_{0}.}  [F_0. ] This
      deflection is called the static deflection      &#x03B4;  s t   .
      {\displaystyle \delta _{st}.}  [\delta_{st}.] Hence, when r âª 1 the
      effects of the damper and the mass are minimal.
    * When r â« 1 the amplitude of the vibration is actually less than the
      static deflection      &#x03B4;  s t   .   {\displaystyle \delta _{st}.}
      [\delta_{st}.] In this region the force generated by the mass (F = ma) is
      dominating because the acceleration seen by the mass increases with the
      frequency. Since the deflection seen in the spring, X, is reduced in this
      region, the force transmitted by the spring (F = kx) to the base is
      reduced. Therefore, the mass–spring–damper system is isolating the
      harmonic force from the mounting base â referred to as vibration
      isolation. More damping actually reduces the effects of vibration
      isolation when r â« 1 because the damping force (F = cv) is also
      transmitted to the base.
    * whatever the damping is, the vibration is 90 degrees out of phase with
      the forcing frequency when the frequency ratio r = 1, which is very
      helpful when it comes to determining the natural frequency of the system.
    * whatever the damping is, when r â« 1, the vibration is 180 degrees out
      of phase with the forcing frequency
    * whatever the damping is, when r âª 1, the vibration is in phase with the
      forcing frequency
*** Resonance causes[edit] ***
Resonance is simple to understand if the spring and mass are viewed as energy
storage elements â with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring
storing potential energy. As discussed earlier, when the mass and spring have
no external force acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate
equal to the natural frequency. In other words, to efficiently pump energy into
both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a
rate equal to the natural frequency. Applying a force to the mass and spring is
similar to pushing a child on swing, a push is needed at the correct moment to
make the swing get higher and higher. As in the case of the swing, the force
applied need not be high to get large motions, but must just add energy to the
system.
The damper, instead of storing energy, dissipates energy. Since the damping
force is proportional to the velocity, the more the motion, the more the damper
dissipates the energy. Therefore, there is a point when the energy dissipated
by the damper equals the energy added by the force. At this point, the system
has reached its maximum amplitude and will continue to vibrate at this level as
long as the force applied stays the same. If no damping exists, there is
nothing to dissipate the energy and, theoretically, the motion will continue to
grow into infinity.
*** Applying "complex" forces to the mass–spring–damper model[edit] ***
In a previous section only a simple harmonic force was applied to the model,
but this can be extended considerably using two powerful mathematical tools.
The first is the Fourier_transform that takes a signal as a function of time
(time_domain) and breaks it down into its harmonic components as a function of
frequency (frequency_domain). For example, by applying a force to the
mass–spring–damper model that repeats the following cycle â a force equal to
1 newton for 0.5 second and then no force for 0.5 second. This type of force
has the shape of a 1 Hz square_wave.
How a 1 Hz square wave can be represented as a summation of sine waves
(harmonics) and the corresponding frequency spectrum. Click and go to full
resolution for an animation
The Fourier transform of the square wave generates a frequency_spectrum that
presents the magnitude of the harmonics that make up the square wave (the phase
is also generated, but is typically of less concern and therefore is often not
plotted). The Fourier transform can also be used to analyze non-periodic
functions such as transients (e.g. impulses) and random functions. The Fourier
transform is almost always computed using the fast_Fourier_transform (FFT)
computer algorithm in combination with a window_function.
In the case of our square wave force, the first component is actually a
constant force of 0.5 newton and is represented by a value at 0 Hz in the
frequency spectrum. The next component is a 1 Hz sine wave with an amplitude of
0.64. This is shown by the line at 1 Hz. The remaining components are at odd
frequencies and it takes an infinite amount of sine waves to generate the
perfect square wave. Hence, the Fourier transform allows you to interpret the
force as a sum of sinusoidal forces being applied instead of a more "complex"
force (e.g. a square wave).
In the previous section, the vibration solution was given for a single harmonic
force, but the Fourier transform in general gives multiple harmonic forces. The
second mathematical tool, "the principle of superposition", allows the
summation of the solutions from multiple forces if the system is linear. In the
case of the springâmassâdamper model, the system is linear if the spring
force is proportional to the displacement and the damping is proportional to
the velocity over the range of motion of interest. Hence, the solution to the
problem with a square wave is summing the predicted vibration from each one of
the harmonic forces found in the frequency spectrum of the square wave.
*** Frequency response model[edit] ***
The solution of a vibration problem can be viewed as an input/output relation
â where the force is the input and the output is the vibration. Representing
the force and vibration in the frequency domain (magnitude and phase) allows
the following relation:
         X ( i &#x03C9; ) = H ( i &#x03C9; ) &#x22C5; F ( i &#x03C9; )
      &#xA0;or&#xA0;  H ( i &#x03C9; ) =    X ( i &#x03C9; )   F ( i &#x03C9; )
      .   {\displaystyle X(i\omega )=H(i\omega )\cdot F(i\omega ){\text{ or }}H
      (i\omega )={X(i\omega ) \over F(i\omega )}.}  [{\displaystyle X(i\omega
      )=H(i\omega )\cdot F(i\omega ){\text{ or }}H(i\omega )={X(i\omega ) \over
      F(i\omega )}.}]
   H ( i &#x03C9; )   {\displaystyle H(i\omega )}  [H(i\omega)] is called the
frequency_response function (also referred to as the transfer_function, but not
technically as accurate) and has both a magnitude and phase component (if
represented as a complex_number, a real and imaginary component). The magnitude
of the frequency response function (FRF) was presented earlier for the
mass–spring–damper system.
          |  H ( i &#x03C9; )  |  =  |    X ( i &#x03C9; )   F ( i &#x03C9; )
      |  =   1 k     1   ( 1 &#x2212;  r  2    )  2   + ( 2 &#x03B6; r  )  2
      ,  &#xA0;where&#xA0;  r =   f  f  n     =   &#x03C9;  &#x03C9;  n     .
      {\displaystyle |H(i\omega )|=\left|{X(i\omega ) \over F(i\omega
      )}\right|={1 \over k}{1 \over {\sqrt {(1-r^{2})^{2}+(2\zeta r)^{2}}}},
      {\text{ where }}r={\frac {f}{f_{n}}}={\frac {\omega }{\omega _{n}}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle |H(i\omega )|=\left|{X(i\omega ) \over F(i\omega
      )}\right|={1 \over k}{1 \over {\sqrt {(1-r^{2})^{2}+(2\zeta r)^{2}}}},
      {\text{ where }}r={\frac {f}{f_{n}}}={\frac {\omega }{\omega _{n}}}.}]
The phase of the FRF was also presented earlier as:
         &#x2220; H ( i &#x03C9; ) = &#x2212; arctan &#x2061;  (    2 &#x03B6;
      r   1 &#x2212;  r  2      )  .   {\displaystyle \angle H(i\omega )=-
      \arctan \left({\frac {2\zeta r}{1-r^{2}}}\right).}  [{\displaystyle
      \angle H(i\omega )=-\arctan \left({\frac {2\zeta r}{1-r^{2}}}\right).}]
For example, calculating the FRF for a mass–spring–damper system with a mass of
1 kg, spring stiffness of 1.93 N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of
the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7 Hz for this specific system.
Applying the 1 Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the
predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting
vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square
wave falls at 7 Hz. The frequency response of the mass–spring–damper therefore
outputs a high 7 Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low
7 Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is
dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied
to.
Frequency response model
The figure also shows the time domain representation of the resulting
vibration. This is done by performing an inverse Fourier Transform that
converts frequency domain data to time domain. In practice, this is rarely done
because the frequency spectrum provides all the necessary information.
The frequency response function (FRF) does not necessarily have to be
calculated from the knowledge of the mass, damping, and stiffness of the
systemâbut can be measured experimentally. For example, if a known force over
a range of frequencies is applied, and if the associated vibrations are
measured, the frequency response function can be calculated, thereby
characterizing the system. This technique is used in the field of experimental
modal_analysis to determine the vibration characteristics of a structure.
***** Multiple degrees of freedom systems and mode shapes[edit] *****
The simple mass–spring–damper model is the foundation of vibration analysis,
but what about more complex systems? The mass–spring–damper model described
above is called a single degree_of_freedom (SDOF) model since the mass is
assumed to only move up and down. In more complex systems, the system must be
discretized into more masses that move in more than one direction, adding
degrees of freedom. The major concepts of multiple degrees of freedom (MDOF)
can be understood by looking at just a 2 degree of freedom model as shown in
the figure.
2 degree of freedom model
The equations of motion of the 2DOF system are found to be:
          m  1       x  1   &#x00A8;    + (  c  1   +  c  2   )     x  1
      &#x02D9;    &#x2212;  c  2       x  2   &#x02D9;    + (  k  1   +  k  2
      )  x  1   &#x2212;  k  2    x  2   =  f  1   ,   {\displaystyle m_{1}
      {\ddot {x_{1}}}+(c_{1}+c_{2}){\dot {x_{1}}}-c_{2}{\dot {x_{2}}}+(k_{1}+k_
      {2})x_{1}-k_{2}x_{2}=f_{1},}  [{\displaystyle m_{1}{\ddot {x_{1}}}+(c_
      {1}+c_{2}){\dot {x_{1}}}-c_{2}{\dot {x_{2}}}+(k_{1}+k_{2})x_{1}-k_{2}x_
      {2}=f_{1},}]
          m  2       x  2   &#x00A8;    &#x2212;  c  2       x  1   &#x02D9;
      + (  c  2   +  c  3   )     x  2   &#x02D9;    &#x2212;  k  2    x  1   +
      (  k  2   +  k  3   )  x  2   =  f  2   .    {\displaystyle m_{2}{\ddot
      {x_{2}}}-c_{2}{\dot {x_{1}}}+(c_{2}+c_{3}){\dot {x_{2}}}-k_{2}x_{1}+(k_
      {2}+k_{3})x_{2}=f_{2}.\!}  [{\displaystyle m_{2}{\ddot {x_{2}}}-c_{2}
      {\dot {x_{1}}}+(c_{2}+c_{3}){\dot {x_{2}}}-k_{2}x_{1}+(k_{2}+k_{3})x_
      {2}=f_{2}.\!}]
This can be rewritten in matrix format:
           [     m  1     0     0    m  2      ]     {        x  1   &#x00A8;
      x  2   &#x00A8;       }   +   [     c  1   +  c  2     &#x2212;  c  2
      &#x2212;  c  2      c  2   +  c  3      ]     {        x  1   &#x02D9;
      x  2   &#x02D9;       }   +   [     k  1   +  k  2     &#x2212;  k  2
      &#x2212;  k  2      k  2   +  k  3      ]     {     x  1        x  2
      }   =   {     f  1        f  2      }   .   {\displaystyle {\begin
      {bmatrix}m_{1}&0\\0&m_{2}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}{\ddot {x_{1}}}\\
      {\ddot {x_{2}}}\end{Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}c_{1}+c_{2}&-c_{2}\\-c_
      {2}&c_{2}+c_{3}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}{\dot {x_{1}}}\\{\dot {x_
      {2}}}\end{Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}k_{1}+k_{2}&-k_{2}\\-k_{2}&k_{2}+k_
      {3}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}x_{1}\\x_{2}\end{Bmatrix}}={\begin
      {Bmatrix}f_{1}\\f_{2}\end{Bmatrix}}.}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}m_
      {1}&0\\0&m_{2}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}{\ddot {x_{1}}}\\{\ddot {x_
      {2}}}\end{Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}c_{1}+c_{2}&-c_{2}\\-c_{2}&c_{2}+c_
      {3}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}{\dot {x_{1}}}\\{\dot {x_{2}}}\end
      {Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}k_{1}+k_{2}&-k_{2}\\-k_{2}&k_{2}+k_{3}\end
      {bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}x_{1}\\x_{2}\end{Bmatrix}}={\begin{Bmatrix}f_
      {1}\\f_{2}\end{Bmatrix}}.}]
A more compact form of this matrix equation can be written as:
           [    M    ]     {       x &#x00A8;       }   +   [    C    ]
      {       x &#x02D9;       }   +   [    K    ]     {    x    }   =   {    f
      }     {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}
      {\ddot {x}}\end{Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}
      {\dot {x}}\end{Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {Bmatrix}x\end{Bmatrix}}={\begin{Bmatrix}f\end{Bmatrix}}}  [
      \begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin
      {bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\dot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin
      {bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{Bmatrix} f
      \end{Bmatrix}
      ]
where       [    M    ]   ,   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}},}
[\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix},]       [    C    ]   ,   {\displaystyle {\begin
{bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix}},}  [\begin{bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix},] and       [    K
]     {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}}  [\begin{bmatrix}K\end
{bmatrix}] are symmetric_matrices referred respectively as the mass, damping,
and stiffness matrices. The matrices are NxN square matrices where N is the
number of degrees of freedom of the system.
The following analysis involves the case where there is no damping and no
applied forces (i.e. free vibration). The solution of a viscously damped system
is somewhat more complicated.[7]
           [    M    ]     {       x &#x00A8;       }   +   [    K    ]
      {    x    }   = 0.   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}
      {\begin{Bmatrix}{\ddot {x}}\end{Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}
      {\begin{Bmatrix}x\end{Bmatrix}}=0.}  [\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin
      {Bmatrix}\ddot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin
      {Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=0.]
This differential equation can be solved by assuming the following type of
solution:
           {    x    }   =   {    X    }    e  i &#x03C9; t   .
      {\displaystyle {\begin{Bmatrix}x\end{Bmatrix}}={\begin{Bmatrix}X\end
      {Bmatrix}}e^{i\omega t}.}  [
      \begin{Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{Bmatrix} X\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\omega
      t}.
      ]
Note: Using the exponential solution of       {    X    }    e  i &#x03C9; t
{\displaystyle {\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}}e^{i\omega t}}  [ \begin{Bmatrix}
X\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\omega t}] is a mathematical trick used to solve linear
differential equations. Using Euler's_formula and taking only the real part of
the solution it is the same cosine solution for the 1 DOF system. The
exponential solution is only used because it is easier to manipulate
mathematically.
The equation then becomes:
           [    &#x2212;  &#x03C9;  2     [    M    ]   +   [    K    ]      ]
      {    X    }    e  i &#x03C9; t   = 0.   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}-
      \omega ^{2}{\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}K\end
      {bmatrix}}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}}e^{i\omega t}=0.}
      [{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}-\omega ^{2}{\begin{bmatrix}M\end
      {bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}}e^{i\omega t}=0.}]
Since      e  i &#x03C9; t     {\displaystyle e^{i\omega t}}  [e^{i\omega t}]
cannot equal zero the equation reduces to the following.
           [      [    K    ]   &#x2212;  &#x03C9;  2     [    M    ]      ]
      {    X    }   = 0.   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}{\begin{bmatrix}K\end
      {bmatrix}}-\omega ^{2}{\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}\end{bmatrix}}
      {\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}}=0.}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}
      {\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}-\omega ^{2}{\begin{bmatrix}M\end
      {bmatrix}}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}}=0.}]
**** Eigenvalue problem[edit] ****
This is referred to an eigenvalue problem in mathematics and can be put in the
standard format by pre-multiplying the equation by        [    M    ]

and if:        [    M    ]    &#x2212; 1     [    K    ]   =   [    A    ]

      {Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}=0.]
The solution to the problem results in N eigenvalues (i.e.      &#x03C9;  1   2
,  &#x03C9;  2   2   , &#x22EF;  &#x03C9;  N   2     {\displaystyle \omega _
{1}^{2},\omega _{2}^{2},\cdots \omega _{N}^{2}}
[\omega_1^2,\omega_2^2,\cdots\omega_N^2]), where N corresponds to the number of
degrees of freedom. The eigenvalues provide the natural frequencies of the
system. When these eigenvalues are substituted back into the original set of
equations, the values of       {    X    }     {\displaystyle {\begin
{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}}}  [\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}] that correspond to
each eigenvalue are called the eigenvectors. These eigenvectors represent the
mode_shapes of the system. The solution of an eigenvalue problem can be quite
cumbersome (especially for problems with many degrees of freedom), but
fortunately most math analysis programs have eigenvalue routines.
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are often written in the following matrix
format and describe the modal model of the system:

A simple example using the 2 DOF model can help illustrate the concepts. Let
both masses have a mass of 1 kg and the stiffness of all three springs equal
1000 N/m. The mass and stiffness matrix for this problem are then:
           [    M    ]   =   [    1   0     0   1    ]     {\displaystyle
      {\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}}}
      [\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}]
      and       [    K    ]   =   [    2000   &#x2212; 1000     &#x2212; 1000
      2000    ]   .   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}={\begin

      {bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2000 & -1000\\ -1000 & 2000\end{bmatrix}.]
Then       [    A    ]   =   [    2000   &#x2212; 1000     &#x2212; 1000   2000
]   .   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}2000&-
1000\\-1000&2000\end{bmatrix}}.}  [\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}=\begin
{bmatrix}2000 & -1000\\ -1000 & 2000\end{bmatrix}.]
The eigenvalues for this problem given by an eigenvalue routine is:
           [       &#x2572;    &#x03C9;  r &#x2572;   2      ]   =   [    1000
      0     0   3000    ]   .   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}^{\diagdown
      }\omega _{r\diagdown }^{2}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin
      {bmatrix}1000&0\\0&3000\end{bmatrix}}.}  [\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown
      \omega_{r\diagdown}^2 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1000 &  0 \\ 0 & 3000
      \end{bmatrix}.]
The natural frequencies in the units of hertz are then (remembering
&#x03C9; = 2 &#x03C0; f    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \omega =2\pi f}
[\scriptstyle \omega=2 \pi f])       f  1   = 5.033  &#xA0; H z
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle f_{1}=5.033\mathrm {\ Hz} }  [\scriptstyle
f_1=5.033 \mathrm {\ Hz}] and       f  2   = 8.717  &#xA0;Hz  .
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle f_{2}=8.717{\text{ Hz}}.}  [{\displaystyle
\scriptstyle f_{2}=8.717{\text{ Hz}}.}]
The two mode shapes for the respective natural frequencies are given as:
           [    &#x03A8;    ]   =   [      {     &#x03C8;  1      }
      {     &#x03C8;  2      }      ]   =   [       {    &#x2212; 0.707
      &#x2212; 0.707    }    1      {    0.707     &#x2212; 0.707    }    2
      ]   .   {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}={\begin
      {bmatrix}{\begin{Bmatrix}\psi _{1}\end{Bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}\psi _
      {2}\end{Bmatrix}}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}{\begin{Bmatrix}-0.707\\-
      0.707\end{Bmatrix}}_{1}{\begin{Bmatrix}0.707\\-0.707\end{Bmatrix}}_
      {2}\end{bmatrix}}.}  [\begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
      \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_1 \end{Bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_2 \end{Bmatrix}
      \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} -0.707 \\ -0.707 \end
      {Bmatrix}_1 \begin{Bmatrix} 0.707  \\ -0.707  \end{Bmatrix}_2 \end
      {bmatrix}. ]
Since the system is a 2 DOF system, there are two modes with their respective
natural frequencies and shapes. The mode shape vectors are not the absolute
motion, but just describe relative motion of the degrees of freedom. In our
case the first mode shape vector is saying that the masses are moving together
in phase since they have the same value and sign. In the case of the second
mode shape vector, each mass is moving in opposite direction at the same rate.
**** Illustration of a multiple DOF problem[edit] ****
When there are many degrees of freedom, one method of visualizing the mode
shapes is by animating them using structural analysis software such as Femap,
ANSYS or VA One by ESI_Group. An example of animating mode shapes is shown in
the figure below for a cantilevered I-beam as demonstrated using modal_analysis
on ANSYS. In this case, the finite_element_method was used to generate an
approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the object of
interest in order to solve a discrete_eigenvalue_problem. Note that, in this
case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface
(for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies).
Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom
and hence as many natural frequencies and mode shapes, provides a good
approximation for the first natural frequencies and modesâ . Generally, only
the first few modes are important for practical applications.
 In this table the first and second (top and bottom respectively) horizontal
 bending (left), torsional (middle), and vertical bending (right) vibrational
 modes of an I-beam are visualized. There also exist other kinds of
 vibrational modes in which the beam gets compressed/stretched out in the
 height, width and length directions respectively.

^ Note that when performing a numerical approximation of any mathematical
model, convergence of the parameters of interest must be ascertained.
**** Multiple DOF problem converted to a single DOF problem[edit] ****
The eigenvectors have very important properties called orthogonality
properties. These properties can be used to greatly simplify the solution of
multi-degree of freedom models. It can be shown that the eigenvectors have the
following properties:
            [    &#x03A8;    ]    T     [    M    ]     [    &#x03A8;    ]   =
      [       &#x2572;    m  r &#x2572;      ]   ,   {\displaystyle {\begin
      {bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}^{T}{\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}^{\diagdown }m_{r\diagdown
      }\end{bmatrix}},}  [\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin
      {bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
      ^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix},]
            [    &#x03A8;    ]    T     [    K    ]     [    &#x03A8;    ]   =
      [       &#x2572;    k  r &#x2572;      ]   .   {\displaystyle {\begin
      {bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}^{T}{\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}^{\diagdown }k_{r\diagdown
      }\end{bmatrix}}.}  [\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin
      {bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
      ^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}.]
     [       &#x2572;    m  r &#x2572;      ]     {\displaystyle {\begin
{bmatrix}^{\diagdown }m_{r\diagdown }\end{bmatrix}}}  [\begin{bmatrix}
^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}] and       [       &#x2572;    k  r
&#x2572;      ]     {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}^{\diagdown }k_{r\diagdown
}\end{bmatrix}}}  [\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}] are
diagonal_matrices that contain the modal mass and stiffness values for each one
of the modes. (Note: Since the eigenvectors (mode shapes) can be arbitrarily
scaled, the orthogonality properties are often used to scale the eigenvectors
so the modal mass value for each mode is equal to 1. The modal mass matrix is
therefore an identity_matrix)
These properties can be used to greatly simplify the solution of multi-degree
of freedom models by making the following coordinate transformation.
           {    x    }   =   [    &#x03A8;    ]     {    q    }   .
      {\displaystyle {\begin{Bmatrix}x\end{Bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\Psi \end
      {bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}q\end{Bmatrix}}.}  [\begin{Bmatrix} x \end
      {Bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q \end
      {Bmatrix}. ]
Using this coordinate transformation in the original free vibration
differential equation results in the following equation.
           [    M    ]     [    &#x03A8;    ]     {       q &#x00A8;       }
      +   [    K    ]     [    &#x03A8;    ]     {    q    }   = 0.
      {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\Psi \end
      {bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}{\ddot {q}}\end{Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}K\end
      {bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}q\end
      {Bmatrix}}=0.}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}{\ddot {q}}\end{Bmatrix}}+
      {\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {Bmatrix}q\end{Bmatrix}}=0.}]
Taking advantage of the orthogonality properties by premultiplying this
equation by        [    &#x03A8;    ]    T     {\displaystyle {\begin
{bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}^{T}}  [\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}]
            [    &#x03A8;    ]    T     [    M    ]     [    &#x03A8;    ]
      {       q &#x00A8;       }   +    [    &#x03A8;    ]    T     [    K    ]
      [    &#x03A8;    ]     {    q    }   = 0.   {\displaystyle {\begin
      {bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}^{T}{\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}{\ddot {q}}\end{Bmatrix}}+
      {\begin{bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}^{T}{\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}}
      {\begin{bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}q\end{Bmatrix}}=0.}
      [\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin
      {bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{q}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin
      {bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix} \begin
      {bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q\end{Bmatrix}=0.]
The orthogonality properties then simplify this equation to:
           [       &#x2572;    m  r &#x2572;      ]     {       q &#x00A8;
      }   +   [       &#x2572;    k  r &#x2572;      ]     {    q    }   = 0.
      {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}^{\diagdown }m_{r\diagdown }\end{bmatrix}}
      {\begin{Bmatrix}{\ddot {q}}\end{Bmatrix}}+{\begin{bmatrix}^{\diagdown }k_
      {r\diagdown }\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}q\end{Bmatrix}}=0.}  [\begin
      {bmatrix} ^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix}\ddot
      {q}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown}\end{bmatrix}
      \begin{Bmatrix} q\end{Bmatrix}=0.]
This equation is the foundation of vibration analysis for multiple degree of
freedom systems. A similar type of result can be derived for damped systems.[7]
The key is that the modal mass and stiffness matrices are diagonal matrices and
therefore the equations have been "decoupled". In other words, the problem has
been transformed from a large unwieldy multiple degree of freedom problem into
many single degree of freedom problems that can be solved using the same
methods outlined above.
Solving for x is replaced by solving for q, referred to as the modal
coordinates or modal participation factors.
It may be clearer to understand if       {    x    }   =   [    &#x03A8;    ]
{    q    }     {\displaystyle {\begin{Bmatrix}x\end{Bmatrix}}={\begin
{bmatrix}\Psi \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{Bmatrix}q\end{Bmatrix}}}  [\begin{Bmatrix}
x \end{Bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q \end
{Bmatrix} ] is written as:
           {     x  n      }   =  q  1      {    &#x03C8;    }    1   +  q  2
      {    &#x03C8;    }    2   +  q  3      {    &#x03C8;    }    3   +
      &#x22EF; +  q  N      {    &#x03C8;    }    N   .   {\displaystyle
      {\begin{Bmatrix}x_{n}\end{Bmatrix}}=q_{1}{\begin{Bmatrix}\psi \end
      {Bmatrix}}_{1}+q_{2}{\begin{Bmatrix}\psi \end{Bmatrix}}_{2}+q_{3}{\begin
      {Bmatrix}\psi \end{Bmatrix}}_{3}+\cdots +q_{N}{\begin{Bmatrix}\psi \end
      {Bmatrix}}_{N}.}  [\begin{Bmatrix} x_n \end{Bmatrix}= q_1\begin{Bmatrix}
      \psi \end{Bmatrix}_1  +q_2\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_2
      +q_3\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_3 +\cdots +  q_N\begin{Bmatrix}
      \psi \end{Bmatrix}_N.]
Written in this form it can be seen that the vibration at each of the degrees
of freedom is just a linear sum of the mode shapes. Furthermore, how much each
mode "participates" in the final vibration is defined by q, its modal
participation factor.
**** Rigid-body mode[edit] ****
An unrestrained multi-degree of freedom system experiences both rigid-body
translation and/or rotation and vibration. The existence of a rigid-body mode
results in a zero natural frequency. The corresponding mode shape is called the
rigid-body mode.
