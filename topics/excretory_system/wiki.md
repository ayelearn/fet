Excretory system
Anatomical_terminology
[edit_on_Wikidata]
The excretory system is a passive biological system that removes excess,
unnecessary materials from the body_fluids of an organism, so as to help
maintain internal chemical homeostasis and prevent damage to the body. The dual
function of excretory systems is the elimination of the waste_products of
metabolism and to drain the body of used up and broken down components in a
liquid and gaseous state. In humans and other amniotes (mammals, birds and
reptiles) most of these substances leave the body as urine and to some degree
exhalation, mammals also expel them through sweating.
Only the organs specifically used for the excretion are considered a part of
the excretory system. In the narrow sense, the term refer to the urinary
system. However, as excretion involves several functions that are only
superficially related, it is not usually used in more formal classifications of
anatomy or function.
As most healthy functioning organs produce metabolic and other wastes, the
entire organism depends on the function of the system. Breaking down of one of
more of the systems is a serious health condition, for example renal_failure.

***** Systems *****
**** Urinary system ****
Main article: Urinary_system
The kidneys are bean-shaped organs which are present on each side of the
vertebral_column in the abdominal_cavity. Humans have two kidneys and each
kidney is supplied with blood from the renal_artery. The kidneys remove from
the blood the nitrogenous wastes such as urea, as well as salts and excess
water, and excrete them in the form of urine. This is done with the help of
millions of nephrons present in the kidney. The filtrated blood is carried away
from the kidneys by the renal_vein (or kidney vein). The urine from the kidney
is collected by the ureter (or excretory tubes), one from each kidney, and is
passed to the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder collects and stores the
urine until urination. The urine collected in the bladder is passed into the
external environment from the body through an opening called the urethra.
*** Kidneys ***
Main article: Kidneys
The kidney's primary function is the elimination of waste from the bloodstream
by production of urine. They perform several homeostatic functions such as:-
   1. Maintain volume of extracellular fluid
   2. Maintain ionic balance in extracellular fluid
   3. Maintain pH and osmotic concentration of the extracellular fluid.
   4. Excrete toxic metabolic by-products such as urea, ammonia, and uric acid.
The way the kidneys do this is with nephrons. There are over 1 million nephrons
in each kidney; these nephrons act as filters inside the kidneys. The kidneys
filter needed materials and waste, the needed materials go back into the
bloodstream, and unneeded materials becomes urine and is gotten rid of.
In some cases, excess wastes crystallize as kidney stones. They grow and can
become painful irritants that may require surgery or ultrasound treatments.
Some stones are small enough to be forced into the urethra.
*** Ureter ***
Main article: Ureters
The ureters are muscular ducts that propel urine from the kidneys to the
urinary_bladder. In the human adult, the ureters are usually 25â30 cm
(10â12 in) long. In humans, the ureters arise from the renal pelvis on the
medial aspect of each kidney before descending towards the bladder on the front
of the psoas_major muscle. The ureters cross the pelvic brim near the
bifurcation of the iliac arteries (which they run over). This "pelviureteric
junction" is a common site for the impaction of kidney_stones (the other being
the uteterovesical valve). The ureters run posteriorly on the lateral walls of
the pelvis. They then curve anteriormedially to enter the bladder through the
back, at the vesicoureteric junction, running within the wall of the bladder
for a few centimeters. The backflow of urine is prevented by valves known as
ureterovesical valves. In the female, the ureters pass through the mesometrium
on the way to the bladder.
*** Urinary bladder ***
The urinary_bladder is the organ that collects waste excreted by the kidneys
prior to disposal by urination. It is a hollow muscular, and distensible (or
elastic) organ, and sits on the pelvic_floor. Urine enters the bladder via the
ureters and exits via the urethra.
Embryologically, the bladder is derived from the urogenital_sinus, and it is
initially continuous with the allantois. In human males, the base of the
bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic symphysis. It is superior to the
prostate, and separated from the rectum by the rectovesical_excavation. In
females, the bladder sits inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina. It
is separated from the uterus by the vesicouterine_excavation. In infants and
young children, the urinary bladder is in the abdomen even when empty.
*** Urethra ***
In anatomy, the (from Greek â ourethra) is a tube which connects the urinary
bladder to the outside of the body. In humans, the urethra has an excretory
function in both genders to pass.
**** Respiratory system ****
Main article: Respiratory_system
One of the main functions of the lungs is to diffuse gaseous wastes, such as
carbon dioxide, from the bloodstream as a normal part of respiration.
**** Gastrointestinal tract ****
Main article: Gastrointestinal_tract
The large intestine's main function is to transport food particles through the
body and expel the indigestible parts at the other end, but it also collects
waste from throughout the body. The typical brown colour of mammal waste is due
to bilirubin, a breakdown product of normal heme catabolism.[1] The lower part
of the large intestine also extracts any remaining usable water and then
removes solid waste. At about 10 feet long in humans, it transports the wastes
through the tubes to be excreted.
**** Biliary system ****
Main article: Biliary_system
The liver detoxifies and breaks down chemicals, poisons and other toxins that
enter the body. For example, the liver transforms ammonia (which is poisonous)
into urea in fish, amphibians and mammals, and into uric_acid in birds and
reptiles. Urea is filtered by the kidney into urine or through the gills in
fish and tadpoles. Uric acid is paste-like and expelled as a semi-solid waste
(the "white" in bird excrements). The liver also produces bile, and the body
uses bile to break down fats into usable fats and unusable waste.
Invertebrates lack a liver, but most terrestrial groups, like insects,
possesses a number of blind guts that serve the similar functions. Marine
invertebrates do not need the ammonia conversion of the liver, as they can
usually expel ammonia directly by diffusion through the skin.
**** Integumentary system ****
Main article: Integumentary_system
*** Skin ***
Sweat_glands in the skin secrete a fluid waste called sweat or perspiration;
however, its primary functions are temperature control and pheromone release.
Therefore, its role as a part of the excretory system is minimal. Sweating also
maintains the level of salt in the body.
In mammals, the skin excretes sweat through sweat glands throughout the body.
The sweat, helped by salt, evaporates and helps to keep the body cool when it
is warm. In amphibians, the lungs are very simple, and they lack the necessary
means to the exhale like other tetrapods can. The moist, scale-less skin is
therefore essential in helping to rid the blood of carbon_dioxide, and also
allows for urea to be expelled through diffusion when submerged.[2]
In small-bodied marine invertebrates, the skin is the most important excretory
organ. That is particularly true for acoelomate groups like cnidarians,
flatworms and nemerteans, who have no body cavities and hence no body fluid
that can be drained or purified by nephrons, which is the reason acoelomate
animals are thread-like (nemertans), flat (flatworms) or only consist of a thin
layer of cells around a gelatinous non-cellular interior (cnidarians).[3]
*** Eccrine ***
Like sweat glands, eccrine glands allow excess water to leave the body. The
majority of eccrine glands are located mainly on the forehead, the bottoms of
the feet, and the palms, although the glands are everywhere throughout the
body. They help the body to maintain temperature control. Eccrine glands in the
skin are unique to mammals.[citation_needed]
Secretions of sweat from the eccrine glands play a large role in controlling
the body temperature of humans. Regulation of body temperature, also known as
thermoregulation, is very important when it comes to instances that bring the
bodyâs temperature outside of the homeostatic temperature such as with a
fever or even exercise.[4] Together these glands make up the size of about one
kidney and in one day a human can perspire amounts as much as 10 liters. The
two functions consist of secretion of a filtrate in response to acetylcholine
and reabsorption of sodium near the duct when there is water in excess so that
a sweat can be surfacing the skin.[5]
There are three parts to the eccrine sweat gland and these are the pore, the
duct, and the gland. The pore is the portion that goes through the outermost
layer of the skin and is typically 5-10 microns in diameter. The duct is the
part of the sweat gland that connects dermis cells to the epidermis. It is
composed by two layers of cells and is between 10 and 20 microns in diameter.
The gland does the actual secretion and it lies deep within the dermis. The
cells that make up the gland are larger in size than the duct cells and its
lumen is around 20 microns in diameter.[6]
***** Substances *****
**** Bile ****
Main article: Bile
After bile is produced in the liver, it is stored in the gall bladder. It is
then secreted within the small intestine where it helps to emulsify fats in the
same manner as a soap. Bile also contains bilirubin, which is a waste product.
Bile salts can be considered waste that is useful for the body given that they
have a role in fat absorption from the stomach. They are excreted from the
liver and along with blood flow they help to form the shape of the liver where
they are excreted. For instance, if biliary drainage is impaired than that part
of the liver will end up wasting away.
Biliary obstruction is typically due to masses blocking the ducts of the system
such as tumors. The consequences of this depend on the site of blockage and how
long it goes on for. There is inflammation of the ducts due to the irritation
from the bile acids and this can cause infections. If rupture of the duct takes
place it is very traumatic and even fatal.[7]
**** Urine ****
Main article: Urine
Within the kidney, blood first passes through the afferent artery to the
capillary formation called a glomerulus and is collected in the Bowman's
capsule, which filters the blood from its contentsâprimarily food and wastes.
After the filtration process, the blood then returns to collect the food
nutrients it needs, while the wastes pass into the collecting duct, to the
renal pelvis, and to the ureter, and are then secreted out of the body via the
urinary bladder.

***** Clinical signifiance *****
**** Kidney Stones ****
Main article: Kidney_stone_disease
Scientifically, masses referred to as a renal calculus or nephrolith, or more
commonly, âkidney stones,â are solid masses of crystals that may be a
variety of shapes, sizes, and textures, that can reside within one or both of
the kidneys.[8] Kidney stones form when the balance is off between the
concentration of substances that pass through urine, and the substances that
are supposed to dissolve them. When substances are not properly dissolved, they
have the ability to build up, and form these kidney stones. These stones are
most commonly made up of substances such as calcium, cystine, oxalate, and uric
acid, as these are the substances that normally would dissolve within the
urine. When they do not dissolve correctly and further build up, they will
commonly lodge themselves in the urinary tract and in this case, are usually
small enough to pass through urine. In extreme situations, however, these
stones may lodge themselves within the tube that connects the kidney and the
bladder, called the ureter. In this case, they become very large in size and
will most likely cause great pain, bleeding, and possibly even block the flow
of urine.[9] These can occur in both men and women, and studies show that
around 12% of men, and 8% of women in America will develop kidney stones within
their lifetime.[10]
*** Treatment ***
In those extreme situations, in which kidney stones are too large to pass on
their own, patients may seek removal. Most of these treatments involving kidney
stone removal are done by a urologist; a physician who specializes in the
organs of the Urinary_system.[11] A common way of removal is shock wave
lithotripsy, in which the urologist will shock the kidney stone into smaller
pieces via laser, allowing these pieces to further pass through the urine on
their own, as a normal case of kidney stones. Larger, more serious cases may
demand Cystoscopy, Ureteroscopy, or Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy, in which the
doctor will use a viewing tool or camera to locate the stone, and based on the
size or situation, may either chose to continue with surgical removal, or use
the shock wave lithotripsy treatment. Once the kidney stone(s) are successfully
eliminated, the urologist will commonly suggest medication to prevent future
recurrences.[8]
**** Pyelonephritis ****
Main article: Pyelonephritis
Pyelonephritis is a type of urinary_tract_infection that occurs when bacteria
enters the body through the urinary tract. It causes an inflammation of the
renal parenchyma, calyces, and pelvis.[12] There are three main classifications
of pyelonephritis: acute, chronic and xanthogranulomatous.
*** Acute Pyelonephritis ***
In acute pyelonephritis, the patient experiences high fever, abdominal pain and
pain while passing urine. Treatment for acute pyelonephritis is provided via
antibiotics and an extensive urological investigation is conducted to find any
abnormalities and prevent recurrence.[13]
*** Chronic Pyelonephritis ***
In chronic pyelonephritis, patients experience persistent abdominal and flank
pain, high fever, decreased appetite, weight loss, urinary tract symptoms and
blood in the urine. Chronic pyelonephritis can also lead to scarring of the
renal parenchyma caused by recurrent kidney infections.[14]
*** Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis ***
Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an unusual form of chronic
pyelonephritis. It results in severe destruction of the kidney and causes
granulomatous abscess formation. Patients infected with Xanthogranulomatous
pyelonephritis experience recurrent fevers, anemia, kidney stones and loss of
function in the affected kidney.[14]
*** Treatment ***
A urine culture and antibiotics sensitivity test is issued for patients who are
believed to have pyelonephritis. Since most cases of pyelonephritis are caused
from bacterial infections, antibiotics are a common treatment option. Depending
on the species of the infecting organism and the antibiotics sensitivity
profile of the organism, treatments may include fluoroquinolones,
cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or trimethoprim individually or in
combination.[15] For patients with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis,
treatment might include antibiotics as well as surgery. Nephrectomy is the most
common surgical treatment for a majority of cases involving xanthogranulomatous
pyelonephritis.[14]
*** Epidemiology ***
In men, roughly 2-3 cases per 10,000 are treated as outpatients and 1 in 10,000
cases require admission to the hospital. In women, approximately 12-13 in
10,000 cases are treated as outpatients and 3-4 cases are admitted to a
hospital.[16] The most common age group affected by Xanthogranulomatous
pyelonephritis is middle-aged women.[17] Infants and elderly are also at an
increased risk because of hormonal and anatomical changes.[18]
