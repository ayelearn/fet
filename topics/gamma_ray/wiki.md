Energetic electromagnetic radiation arising from radioactive decay of atomic

(disambiguation).

rays and gamma rays
A gamma ray, or gamma radiation (symbol ÃÂ³ or     &#x03B3;   {\displaystyle
\gamma }  [\gamma ]), is a penetrating electromagnetic_radiation arising from
the radioactive_decay of atomic_nuclei. It consists of the shortest wavelength
electromagnetic waves and so imparts the highest photon_energy. Paul_Villard, a
French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying
radiation emitted by radium. In 1903, Ernest_Rutherford named this radiation
gamma rays based on their relatively strong penetration of matter; he had
previously discovered two less penetrating types of decay radiation, which he
named alpha_rays and beta_rays in ascending order of penetrating power.
Gamma rays from radioactive decay are in the energy range from a few
kiloelectron volts (keV) to approximately 8 megaelectronvolts (~8Â MeV),
corresponding to the typical energy levels in nuclei with reasonably long
lifetimes. The energy spectrum of gamma rays can be used to identify the
decaying radionuclides using gamma_spectroscopy. Very-high-energy_gamma_rays in
the 100Ã¢Â€Â“1000 teraelectron volt (TeV) range have been observed from sources
such as the Cygnus_X-3 microquasar.
Natural sources of gamma rays originating on Earth are mostly as a result of
radioactive decay and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with
cosmic_ray particles. However, there are other rare natural sources, such as
terrestrial_gamma-ray_flashes, which produce gamma rays from electron action
upon the nucleus. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include fission,
such as that which occurs in nuclear_reactors, and high_energy_physics
experiments, such as neutral_pion_decay and nuclear_fusion.
Gamma rays and X-rays are both electromagnetic radiation, and since they
overlap in the electromagnetic_spectrum, the terminology varies between
scientific disciplines. In some fields of physics, they are distinguished by
their origin: Gamma rays are created by nuclear decay, while in the case of X-
rays, the origin is outside the nucleus. In astrophysics, gamma rays are
conventionally defined as having photon_energies above 100Â keV and are the
subject of gamma_ray_astronomy, while radiation below 100Â keV is classified as
X-rays and is the subject of X-ray_astronomy. This convention stems from the
early man-made X-rays, which had energies only up to 100 keV, whereas many
gamma rays could go to higher energies. A large fraction of astronomical gamma
rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere.
Gamma rays are ionizing_radiation and are thus biologically hazardous. Due to
their high penetration power, they can damage bone marrow and internal organs.
Unlike alpha and beta rays, they pass easily through the body and thus pose a
formidable radiation_protection challenge, requiring shielding made from dense
materials such as lead or concrete.

***** History of discovery[edit] *****
The first gamma ray source to be discovered was the radioactive_decay process
called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an excited nucleus emits a gamma ray
almost immediately upon formation.[note_1] Paul_Villard, a French chemist and
physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted
from radium. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than
previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first
noted as "radioactivity" by Henri_Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered
as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However,
Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type.[1][2]
Later, in 1903, Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type
fundamentally different from previously named rays by Ernest_Rutherford, who
named Villard's rays "gamma rays" by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that
Rutherford had differentiated in 1899.[3] The "rays" emitted by radioactive
elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials,
using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least
penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most
penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at
least, not easily deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them
unlike alpha and beta rays.
Gamma rays were first thought to be particles with mass, like alpha and beta
rays. Rutherford initially believed that they might be extremely fast beta
particles, but their failure to be deflected by a magnetic field indicated that
they had no charge.[4] In 1914, gamma rays were observed to be reflected from
crystal surfaces, proving that they were electromagnetic radiation.[4]
Rutherford and his co-worker Edward_Andrade measured the wavelengths of gamma
rays from radium, and found that they were similar to X-rays, but with shorter
wavelengths and (thus) higher frequency. This was eventually recognized as
giving them more energy per photon, as soon as the latter term became generally
accepted. A gamma decay was then understood to usually emit a gamma photon.
***** Sources[edit] *****
[File:NASA's Fermi Explores the Early Universe.ogv]Play_media
This animation tracks several gamma rays through space and time, from their
emission in the jet of a distant blazar to their arrival in Fermi's Large Area
Telescope (LAT).
Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally
occurring radioisotopes such as potassium-40, and also as a secondary radiation
from various atmospheric interactions with cosmic_ray particles. Some rare
terrestrial natural sources that produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear
origin, are lightning_strikes and terrestrial_gamma-ray_flashes, which produce
high energy emissions from natural high-energy voltages. Gamma rays are
produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy
electrons are produced. Such electrons produce secondary gamma rays by the
mechanisms of bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton_scattering and synchrotron
radiation. A large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by
Earth's atmosphere. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include fission,
such as occurs in nuclear_reactors, as well as high_energy_physics experiments,
such as neutral_pion_decay and nuclear_fusion.
A sample of gamma ray-emitting material that is used for irradiating or imaging
is known as a gamma source. It is also called a radioactive_source, isotope
source, or radiation source, though these more general terms also apply to
alpha- and beta-emitting devices. Gamma sources are usually sealed to prevent
radioactive contamination, and transported in heavy shielding.
**** Radioactive decay (gamma decay)[edit] ****
Main article: Nuclear_isomer
Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay, which normally occurs after other
forms of decay occur, such as alpha or beta decay. An excited nucleus can decay
by the emission of an

Î±
 or

Î²
 particle. The daughter_nucleus that results is usually left in an excited
state. It can then decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray
photon, in a process called gamma decay.
The emission of a gamma ray from an excited nucleus typically requires only
10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’12 seconds. Gamma decay may also follow nuclear_reactions such as neutron
capture, nuclear_fission, or nuclear_fusion. Gamma decay is also a mode of
relaxation of many excited states of atomic nuclei following other types of
radioactive decay, such as beta_decay, so long as these states possess the
necessary component of nuclear spin. When high-energy gamma rays, electrons, or
protons bombard materials, the excited atoms emit characteristic "secondary"
gamma rays, which are products of the creation of excited nuclear states in the
bombarded atoms. Such transitions, a form of nuclear gamma fluorescence, form a
topic in nuclear_physics called gamma_spectroscopy. Formation of fluorescent
gamma rays are a rapid subtype of radioactive gamma decay.
In certain cases, the excited nuclear state that follows the emission of a beta
particle or other type of excitation, may be more stable than average, and is
termed a metastable excited state, if its decay takes (at least) 100 to 1000
times longer than the average 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’12 seconds. Such relatively long-lived
excited nuclei are termed nuclear_isomers, and their decays are termed isomeric
transitions. Such nuclei have half-lifes that are more easily measurable, and
rare nuclear isomers are able to stay in their excited state for minutes,
hours, days, or occasionally far longer, before emitting a gamma ray. The
process of isomeric transition is therefore similar to any gamma emission, but
differs in that it involves the intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the
nuclei. Metastable states are often characterized by high nuclear_spin,
requiring a change in spin of several units or more with gamma decay, instead
of a single unit transition that occurs in only 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’12 seconds. The rate of
gamma decay is also slowed when the energy of excitation of the nucleus is
small.[5]
An emitted gamma ray from any type of excited state may transfer its energy
directly to any electrons, but most probably to one of the K shell electrons of
the atom, causing it to be ejected from that atom, in a process generally
termed the photoelectric_effect (external gamma rays and ultraviolet rays may
also cause this effect). The photoelectric effect should not be confused with
the internal_conversion process, in which a gamma ray photon is not produced as
an intermediate particle (rather, a "virtual gamma ray" may be thought to
mediate the process).
*** Decay schemes[edit] ***
Radioactive decay scheme of 60
Co
Gamma emission spectrum of cobalt-60
One example of gamma ray production due to radionuclide decay is the decay
scheme for cobalt-60, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram. First,
60
Co
 decays to excited
60
Ni
 by beta_decay emission of an electron of 0.31 MeV. Then the excited 60
Ni
 decays to the ground state (see nuclear_shell_model) by emitting gamma rays in
succession of 1.17 MeV followed by 1.33 MeV. This path is followed 99.88% of
the time:
      60         60
      27Co  Ã¢Â†Â28Ni* +Â eâˆ’ +Â Î½ +Â Î³ +Â 1.17Â MeV
      Â          Â        Â       e     Â 
                                  Â 
      60         60

      Â          Â                      Â 
Another example is the alpha decay of
241
Am
 to form
237
Np
; which is followed by gamma emission. In some cases, the gamma emission
spectrum of the daughter nucleus is quite simple, (e.g. 60
Co
/60
Ni
) while in other cases, such as with (241
Am
/237
Np
 and
192
Ir
/192
Pt
), the gamma emission spectrum is complex, revealing that a series of nuclear
energy levels exist.
**** Particle physics[edit] ****
Gamma rays are produced in many processes of particle_physics. Typically, gamma
rays are the products of neutral systems which decay through electromagnetic
interactions (rather than a weak or strong interaction). For example, in an
electronÃ¢Â€Â“positron_annihilation, the usual products are two gamma ray photons.
If the annihilating electron and positron are at rest, each of the resulting
gamma rays has an energy of ~ 511 keV and frequency of ~ 1.24ÃƒÂ—1020Â Hz.
Similarly, a neutral pion most often decays into two photons. Many other
hadrons and massive bosons also decay electromagnetically. High energy physics
experiments, such as the Large_Hadron_Collider, accordingly employ substantial
radiation shielding.[6] Because subatomic_particles mostly have far shorter
wavelengths than atomic nuclei, particle physics gamma rays are generally
several orders of magnitude more energetic than nuclear decay gamma rays. Since
gamma rays are at the top of the electromagnetic spectrum in terms of energy,
all extremely high-energy photons are gamma rays; for example, a photon having
the Planck_energy would be a gamma ray.
**** Gamma rays from sources other than radioactive decay[edit] ****
Main article: Gamma-ray_astronomy
A few gamma rays in astronomy are known to arise from gamma decay (see
discussion of SN1987A), but most do not.
Photons from astrophysical sources that carry energy in the gamma radiation
range are often explicitly called gamma-radiation. In addition to nuclear
emissions, they are often produced by sub-atomic particle and particle-photon
interactions. Those include electron-positron_annihilation, neutral_pion_decay,
bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton_scattering, and synchrotron_radiation.

Flight Center.
*** Laboratory sources[edit] ***
In October 2017, scientists from various European universities proposed a means
for sources of GeV photons using lasers as exciters through a controlled
interplay between the cascade and anomalous radiative_trapping.[7]
*** Terrestrial thunderstorms[edit] ***
Thunderstorms can produce a brief pulse of gamma radiation called a terrestrial
gamma-ray_flash. These gamma rays are thought to be produced by high intensity
static electric fields accelerating electrons, which then produce gamma rays by
bremsstrahlung as they collide with and are slowed by atoms in the atmosphere.
Gamma rays up to 100 MeV can be emitted by terrestrial thunderstorms, and were
discovered by space-borne observatories. This raises the possibility of health
risks to passengers and crew on aircraft flying in or near thunderclouds.[8]
*** Solar flares[edit] ***
The most effusive solar_flares emit across the entire EM spectrum, including
ÃÂ³-rays. The first confident observation occurred in 1972.[9]
*** Cosmic rays[edit] ***
Extraterrestrial, high energy gamma rays include the gamma ray background
produced when cosmic_rays (either high speed electrons or protons) collide with
ordinary matter, producing pair-production gamma rays at 511 keV.
Alternatively, bremsstrahlung are produced at energies of tens of MeV or more
when cosmic ray electrons interact with nuclei of sufficiently high atomic
number (see gamma ray image of the Moon at the beginning of this article, for
illustration).
Image of entire sky in 100 MeV or greater gamma rays as seen by the EGRET
instrument aboard the CGRO spacecraft. Bright spots within the galactic plane
are pulsars while those above and below the plane are thought to be quasars.
*** Pulsars and magnetars[edit] ***
The gamma ray sky (see illustration at right) is dominated by the more common
and longer-term production of gamma rays that emanate from pulsars within the
Milky Way. Sources from the rest of the sky are mostly quasars. Pulsars are
thought to be neutron stars with magnetic fields that produce focused beams of
radiation, and are far less energetic, more common, and much nearer sources
(typically seen only in our own galaxy) than are quasars or the rarer gamma-ray
burst sources of gamma rays. Pulsars have relatively long-lived magnetic fields
that produce focused beams of relativistic speed charged particles, which emit
gamma rays (bremsstrahlung) when those strike gas or dust in their nearby
medium, and are decelerated. This is a similar mechanism to the production of
high-energy photons in megavoltage radiation_therapy machines (see
bremsstrahlung). Inverse_Compton_scattering, in which charged particles
(usually electrons) impart energy to low-energy photons boosting them to higher
energy photons. Such impacts of photons on relativistic charged particle beams
is another possible mechanism of gamma ray production. Neutron stars with a
very high magnetic field (magnetars), thought to produce astronomical soft
gamma_repeaters, are another relatively long-lived star-powered source of gamma
radiation.
*** Quasars and active galaxies[edit] ***
More powerful gamma rays from very distant quasars and closer active galaxies
are thought to have a gamma ray production source similar to a particle
accelerator. High energy electrons produced by the quasar, and subjected to
inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron_radiation, or bremsstrahlung, are the
likely source of the gamma rays from those objects. It is thought that a
supermassive_black_hole at the center of such galaxies provides the power
source that intermittently destroys stars and focuses the resulting charged
particles into beams that emerge from their rotational poles. When those beams
interact with gas, dust, and lower energy photons they produce X-rays and gamma
rays. These sources are known to fluctuate with durations of a few weeks,
suggesting their relatively small size (less than a few light-weeks across).
Such sources of gamma and X-rays are the most commonly visible high intensity
sources outside our galaxy. They shine not in bursts (see illustration), but
relatively continuously when viewed with gamma ray telescopes. The power of a
typical quasar is about 1040 watts, a small fraction of which is gamma
radiation. Much of the rest is emitted as electromagnetic waves of all
frequencies, including radio waves.
A hypernova. Artist's illustration showing the life of a massive_star as
nuclear_fusion converts lighter elements into heavier ones. When fusion no
longer generates enough pressure to counteract gravity, the star rapidly
collapses to form a black_hole. Theoretically, energy may be released during
the collapse along the axis of rotation to form a long duration gamma-ray
burst.
*** Gamma-ray bursts[edit] ***
See also: Gamma-ray_burst
The most intense sources of gamma rays, are also the most intense sources of
any type of electromagnetic radiation presently known. They are the "long
duration burst" sources of gamma rays in astronomy ("long" in this context,
meaning a few tens of seconds), and they are rare compared with the sources
discussed above. By contrast, "short" gamma-ray_bursts of two seconds or less,
which are not associated with supernovae, are thought to produce gamma rays
during the collision of pairs of neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black
hole.[10]
The so-called long-duration gamma-ray bursts produce a total energy output of
about 1044 joules (as much energy as our Sun will produce in its entire life-
time) but in a period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately
50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of
production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse
Compton_scattering and synchrotron_radiation from high-energy charged
particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the
region of the event horizon of a newly formed black_hole created during
supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are
focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding
hypernova. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the
process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth,
it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected
even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is close to the edge
of the visible_universe.
***** Properties[edit] *****
**** Penetration of matter[edit] ****
See also: Radiation_protection_Ã‚Â§Â Electromagnetic_radiation
Alpha_radiation consists of helium nuclei and is readily stopped by a sheet of
paper. Beta_radiation, consisting of electrons or positrons, is stopped by an
aluminum plate, but gamma radiation requires shielding by dense material such
as lead or concrete.
Due to their penetrating nature, gamma rays require large amounts of shielding
mass to reduce them to levels which are not harmful to living cells, in
contrast to alpha_particles, which can be stopped by paper or skin, and beta
particles, which can be shielded by thin aluminium. Gamma rays are best
absorbed by materials with high atomic_numbers and high density, which
contribute to the total stopping power. Because of this, a lead (high Z) shield
is 20Ã¢Â€Â“30% better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another low-
Z shielding material, such as aluminium, concrete, water, or soil; lead's major
advantage is not in lower weight, but rather its compactness due to its higher
density. Protective clothing, goggles and respirators can protect from internal
contact with or ingestion of alpha or beta emitting particles, but provide no
protection from gamma radiation from external sources.
The higher the energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the shielding made from
the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are
typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the
gamma rays by one half (the half_value_layer or HVL). For example, gamma rays
that require 1 cm (0.4Ã¢Â€Â³) of lead to reduce their intensity by 50% will also
have their intensity reduced in half by 4.1 cm of granite rock, 6Â cm (2Ã‚Â½Ã¢Â€Â³)
of concrete, or 9Â cm (3Ã‚Â½Ã¢Â€Â³) of packed soil. However, the mass of this much
concrete or soil is only 20Ã¢Â€Â“30% greater than that of lead with the same
absorption capability. Depleted_uranium is used for shielding in portable_gamma
ray_sources, but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, as a portable
source is very small relative to the required shielding, so the shielding
resembles a sphere to some extent. The volume of a sphere is dependent on the
cube of the radius; so a source with its radius cut in half will have its
volume (and weight) reduced by a factor of eight, which will more than
compensate for uranium's greater density (as well as reducing bulk).
[clarification_needed] In a nuclear power plant, shielding can be provided by
steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while water
provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into
the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a "hot" fuel assembly into
the air would result in much higher radiation levels than when kept under
water.
**** Matter interaction[edit] ****
The total absorption coefficient of aluminium (atomic number 13) for gamma
rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects.
As is usual, the photoelectric effect is largest at low energies, Compton
scattering dominates at intermediate energies, and pair production dominates at
high energies.
The total absorption coefficient of lead (atomic number 82) for gamma rays,
plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. Here,
the photoelectric effect dominates at low energy. Above 5 MeV, pair production
starts to dominate.
When a gamma ray passes through matter, the probability for absorption is
proportional to the thickness of the layer, the density of the material, and
the absorption cross section of the material. The total absorption shows an
exponential_decrease of intensity with distance from the incident surface:
         I ( x ) =  I  0   &#x22C5;  e  &#x2212; &#x03BC; x     {\displaystyle
      I(x)=I_{0}\cdot e^{-\mu x}}  [{\displaystyle I(x)=I_{0}\cdot e^{-\mu x}}]
where x is the thickness of the material from the incident surface, ÃÂ¼= nÃÂƒ is
the absorption coefficient, measured in cmÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1, n the number of atoms per cm3
of the material (atomic density) and ÃÂƒ the absorption cross_section in cm2.
As it passes through matter, gamma radiation ionizes via three processes: the
photoelectric_effect, Compton_scattering, and pair_production.
    * Photoelectric_effect: This describes the case in which a gamma photon
      interacts with and transfers its energy to an atomic electron, causing
      the ejection of that electron from the atom. The kinetic energy of the
      resulting photoelectron is equal to the energy of the incident gamma
      photon minus the energy that originally bound the electron to the atom
      (binding energy). The photoelectric effect is the dominant energy
      transfer mechanism for X-ray and gamma ray photons with energies below 50
      keV (thousand electron volts), but it is much less important at higher
      energies.
    * Compton_scattering: This is an interaction in which an incident gamma
      photon loses enough energy to an atomic electron to cause its ejection,
      with the remainder of the original photon's energy emitted as a new,
      lower energy gamma photon whose emission direction is different from that
      of the incident gamma photon, hence the term "scattering". The
      probability of Compton scattering decreases with increasing photon
      energy. Compton scattering is thought to be the principal absorption
      mechanism for gamma rays in the intermediate energy range 100 keV to 10
      MeV. Compton scattering is relatively independent of the atomic_number of
      the absorbing material, which is why very dense materials like lead are
      only modestly better shields, on a per weight basis, than are less dense
      materials.
    * Pair_production: This becomes possible with gamma energies exceeding 1.02
      MeV, and becomes important as an absorption mechanism at energies over 5
      MeV (see illustration at right, for lead). By interaction with the
      electric_field of a nucleus, the energy of the incident photon is
      converted into the mass of an electron-positron pair. Any gamma energy in
      excess of the equivalent rest mass of the two particles (totaling at
      least 1.02 MeV) appears as the kinetic energy of the pair and in the
      recoil of the emitting nucleus. At the end of the positron's range, it
      combines with a free electron, and the two annihilate, and the entire
      mass of these two is then converted into two gamma photons of at least
      0.51 MeV energy each (or higher according to the kinetic energy of the
      annihilated particles).
The secondary electrons (and/or positrons) produced in any of these three
processes frequently have enough energy to produce much ionization themselves.
Additionally, gamma rays, particularly high energy ones, can interact with
atomic nuclei resulting in ejection of particles in photodisintegration, or in
some cases, even nuclear fission (photofission).
**** Light interaction[edit] ****
High-energy (from 80 GeV to ~10 TeV) gamma rays arriving from far-distant
quasars are used to estimate the extragalactic_background_light in the
universe: The highest-energy rays interact more readily with the background
light photons and thus the density of the background light may be estimated by
analyzing the incoming gamma ray spectra.[11][12]
**** Gamma spectroscopy[edit] ****
Main article: Gamma_spectroscopy
Gamma_spectroscopy is the study of the energetic transitions in atomic nuclei,
which are generally associated with the absorption or emission of gamma rays.
As in optical spectroscopy (see FranckÃ¢Â€Â“Condon effect) the absorption of gamma
rays by a nucleus is especially likely (i.e., peaks in a "resonance") when the
energy of the gamma ray is the same as that of an energy transition in the
nucleus. In the case of gamma rays, such a resonance is seen in the technique
of MÃƒÂ¶ssbauer_spectroscopy. In the MÃƒÂ¶ssbauer_effect the narrow resonance
absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by
physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of
nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no
gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the
emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes
gamma ray resonance absorption to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry
essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces
them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a
second immobilized nucleus of the same type.
***** Uses[edit] *****

container imaging system)
Gamma rays provide information about some of the most energetic phenomena in
the universe; however, they are largely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.
Instruments aboard high-altitude balloons and satellites missions, such as the
Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope, provide our only view of the universe in gamma
rays.
Gamma-induced molecular changes can also be used to alter the properties of
semi-precious_stones, and is often used to change white topaz into blue_topaz.
Non-contact industrial sensors commonly use sources of gamma radiation in
refining, mining, chemicals, food, soaps and detergents, and pulp and paper
industries, for the measurement of levels, density, and thicknesses [13].
Gamma-ray sensors are also used for measuring the fluid levels in water and oil
industries [14]. Typically, these use Co-60 or Cs-137 isotopes as the radiation
source.
In the US, gamma ray detectors are beginning to be used as part of the
Container_Security_Initiative (CSI). These machines are advertised to be able
to scan 30 containers per hour.
Gamma radiation is often used to kill living organisms, in a process called
irradiation. Applications of this include the sterilization of medical
equipment (as an alternative to autoclaves or chemical means), the removal of
decay-causing bacteria from many foods and the prevention of the sprouting of
fruit and vegetables to maintain freshness and flavor.
Despite their cancer-causing properties, gamma rays are also used to treat some
types of cancer, since the rays also kill cancer cells. In the procedure called
gamma-knife surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma rays are directed to
the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells. The beams are aimed from
different angles to concentrate the radiation on the growth while minimizing
damage to surrounding tissues.
Gamma rays are also used for diagnostic purposes in nuclear_medicine in imaging
techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes are used. For
example, in a PET_scan a radiolabeled sugar called fludeoxyglucose emits
positrons that are annihilated by electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays that
highlight cancer as the cancer often has a higher metabolic rate than the
surrounding tissues. The most common gamma emitter used in medical applications
is the nuclear_isomer technetium-99m which emits gamma rays in the same energy
range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a
patient, a gamma_camera can be used to form an image of the radioisotope's
distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also SPECT).
Depending on which molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques
can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread
of cancer to the bones via bone_scan).
***** Health effects[edit] *****
See also: Sievert
Gamma rays cause damage at a cellular level and are penetrating, causing
diffuse damage throughout the body. However, they are less ionising than alpha
or beta particles, which are less penetrating.
Low levels of gamma rays cause a stochastic health risk, which for radiation
dose assessment is defined as the probability of cancer induction and genetic
damage.[15] High doses produce deterministic effects, which is the severity of
acute tissue damage that is certain to happen. These effects are compared to
the physical quantity absorbed_dose measured by the unit gray (Gy).[16]
**** Body response[edit] ****
When gamma radiation breaks DNA molecules, a cell may be able to repair_the
damaged genetic material, within limits. However, a study of Rothkamm and
Lobrich has shown that this repair process works well after high-dose exposure
but is much slower in the case of a low-dose exposure.[17]
**** Risk assessment[edit] ****
The natural outdoor exposure in the United_Kingdom ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 Ã‚ÂµSv/
h with significant increase around known nuclear and contaminated sites.[18]
Natural exposure to gamma rays is about 1 to 2 mSv per year, and the average
total amount of radiation received in one year per inhabitant in the USA is 3.6
mSv.[19] There is a small increase in the dose, due to naturally occurring
gamma radiation, around small particles of high atomic number materials in the
human body caused by the photoelectric_effect.[20]
By comparison, the radiation dose from chest radiography (about 0.06 mSv) is a
fraction of the annual naturally occurring background radiation dose.[21] A
chest CT delivers 5 to 8 mSv. A whole-body PET/CT scan can deliver 14 to 32 mSv
depending on the protocol.[22] The dose from fluoroscopy of the stomach is much
higher, approximately 50 mSv (14 times the annual background).
An acute full-body equivalent single exposure dose of 1 Sv (1000 mSv) causes
slight blood changes, but 2.0Ã¢Â€Â“3.5 Sv (2.0Ã¢Â€Â“3.5 Gy) causes very severe
syndrome of nausea, hair loss, and hemorrhaging, and will cause death in a
sizable number of casesÃ¢Â€Â”-about 10% to 35% without medical treatment. A dose
of 5 Sv[23] (5 Gy) is considered approximately the LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of
exposed population) for an acute exposure to radiation even with standard
medical treatment. A dose higher than 5 Sv (5 Gy) brings an increasing chance
of death above 50%. Above 7.5Ã¢Â€Â“10 Sv (7.5Ã¢Â€Â“10 Gy) to the entire body, even
extraordinary treatment, such as bone-marrow transplants, will not prevent the
death of the individual exposed (see radiation_poisoning).[24] (Doses much
larger than this may, however, be delivered to selected parts of the body in
the course of radiation_therapy.)
For low-dose exposure, for example among nuclear workers, who receive an
average yearly radiation dose of 19 mSv,[clarification_needed] the risk of
dying from cancer (excluding leukemia) increases by 2 percent. For a dose of
100 mSv, the risk increase is 10 percent. By comparison, risk of dying from
cancer was increased by 32 percent for the survivors of the atomic_bombing_of
Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki.[25]

The measure of the ionizing effect of gamma and X-rays in dry air is called the
exposure, for which a legacy unit, the rÃƒÂ¶ntgen was used from 1928. This has
been replaced by kerma, now mainly used for instrument calibration purposes but
not for received dose effect. The effect of gamma and other ionizing radiation
on living tissue is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited in
tissue rather than the ionisation of air, and replacement radiometric units and
quantities for radiation_protection have been defined and developed from 1953
onwards. These are:
    * The gray (Gy), is the SI unit of absorbed_dose, which is the amount of
      radiation energy deposited in the irradiated material. For gamma
      radiation this is numerically equivalent to equivalent_dose measured by
      the sievert, which indicates the stochastic biological effect of low
      levels of radiation on human tissue. The radiation weighting conversion
      factor from absorbed dose to equivalent dose is 1 for gamma, whereas
      alpha particles have a factor of 20, reflecting their greater ionising
      effect on tissue.
    * The rad is the deprecated CGS unit for absorbed dose and the rem is the
      deprecated CGS unit of equivalent dose, used mainly in the USA.

In practice, gamma ray energies overlap with the range of X-rays, especially in
the higher-frequency region referred to as "hard" X-rays. This depiction
follows the older convention of distinguishing by wavelength.
The conventional distinction between X-rays and gamma rays has changed over
time. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray_tubes almost
invariably had a longer wavelength than the radiation (gamma rays) emitted by
radioactive nuclei.[26] Older literature distinguished between X- and gamma
radiation on the basis of wavelength, with radiation shorter than some
arbitrary wavelength, such as 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’11 m, defined as gamma rays.[27] Since the
energy_of_photons is proportional to their frequency and inversely proportional
to wavelength, this past distinction between X-rays and gamma rays can also be
thought of in terms of its energy, with gamma rays considered to be higher
energy electromagnetic radiation than are X-rays.
However, since current artificial sources are now able to duplicate any
electromagnetic radiation that originates in the nucleus, as well as far higher
energies, the wavelengths characteristic of radioactive gamma ray sources vs.
other types now completely overlap. Thus, gamma rays are now usually
distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by definition by electrons
outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus.[26][28][29]
[30] Exceptions to this convention occur in astronomy, where gamma decay is
seen in the afterglow of certain supernovas, but radiation from high energy
processes known to involve other radiation sources than radioactive decay is
still classed as gamma radiation.
The Moon as seen by the Compton_Gamma_Ray_Observatory, in gamma rays of greater
than 20 MeV. These are produced by cosmic_ray bombardment of its surface. The
Sun, which has no similar surface of high atomic_number to act as target for
cosmic rays, cannot usually be seen at all at these energies, which are too
high to emerge from primary nuclear reactions, such as solar nuclear fusion
(though occasionally the Sun produces gamma rays by cyclotron-type mechanisms,
during solar_flares). Gamma rays typically have higher energy than X-rays.[31]
For example, modern high-energy X-rays produced by linear_accelerators for
megavoltage treatment in cancer often have higher energy (4 to 25 MeV) than do
most classical gamma rays produced by nuclear gamma_decay. One of the most
common gamma ray emitting isotopes used in diagnostic nuclear_medicine,
technetium-99m, produces gamma radiation of the same energy (140 keV) as that
produced by diagnostic X-ray machines, but of significantly lower energy than
therapeutic photons from linear particle accelerators. In the medical community
today, the convention that radiation produced by nuclear decay is the only type
referred to as "gamma" radiation is still respected.
Due to this broad overlap in energy ranges, in physics the two types of
electromagnetic radiation are now often defined by their origin: X-rays are
emitted by electrons (either in orbitals outside of the nucleus, or while being
accelerated to produce bremsstrahlung-type radiation),[32] while gamma rays are
emitted by the nucleus or by means of other particle_decays or annihilation
events. There is no lower limit to the energy of photons produced by nuclear
reactions, and thus ultraviolet or lower energy photons produced by these
processes would also be defined as "gamma rays".[33] The only naming-convention
that is still universally respected is the rule that electromagnetic radiation
that is known to be of atomic nuclear origin is always referred to as "gamma
rays", and never as X-rays. However, in physics and astronomy, the converse
convention (that all gamma rays are considered to be of nuclear origin) is
frequently violated.
In astronomy, higher energy gamma and X-rays are defined by energy, since the
processes that produce them may be uncertain and photon energy, not origin,
determines the required astronomical detectors needed.[34] High-energy photons
occur in nature that are known to be produced by processes other than nuclear
decay but are still referred to as gamma radiation. An example is "gamma rays"
from lightning discharges at 10 to 20 MeV, and known to be produced by the
bremsstrahlung mechanism.
Another example is gamma-ray_bursts, now known to be produced from processes
too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing radioactive
decay. This is part and parcel of the general realization that many gamma rays
produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or
particle annihilation, but rather in non-radioactive processes similar to X-
rays.[clarification_needed] Although the gamma rays of astronomy often come
from non-radioactive events, a few gamma rays in astronomy are specifically
known to originate from gamma decay of nuclei (as demonstrated by their spectra
and emission half life). A classic example is that of supernova SN_1987A, which
emits an "afterglow" of gamma-ray photons from the decay of newly made
radioactive nickel-56 and cobalt-56. Most gamma rays in astronomy, however,
arise by other mechanisms.
