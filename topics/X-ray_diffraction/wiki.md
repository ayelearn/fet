Technique used in studying crystal structure
A powder x-ray diffractometer in motion
X-ray crystallography (XRC) is a technique used for determining the atomic and
molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline structure causes a
beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring
the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can
produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the
crystal. From this electron_density, the mean positions of the atoms in the
crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical_bonds, their
crystallographic_disorder, and various other information.
Since many materials can form crystalsâsuch as salts, metals, minerals,
semiconductors, as well as various inorganic, organic, and biological
moleculesâX-ray crystallography has been fundamental in the development of
many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the
size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale
differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method
also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules,
including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic_acids such as DNA. X-ray
crystallography is still the primary method for characterizing the atomic
structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by
other experiments. X-ray crystal_structures can also account for unusual
electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical
interactions and processes, or serve as the basis for designing_pharmaceuticals
against_diseases.
In a single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement, a crystal is mounted on a
goniometer. The goniometer is used to position the crystal at selected
orientations. The crystal is illuminated with a finely focused monochromatic
beam of X-rays, producing a diffraction_pattern of regularly spaced spots known
as reflections. The two-dimensional images taken at different orientations are
converted into a three-dimensional model of the density of electrons within the
crystal using the mathematical method of Fourier_transforms, combined with
chemical data known for the sample. Poor resolution (fuzziness) or even errors
may result if the crystals are too small, or not uniform enough in their
internal makeup.
X-ray crystallography is related to several other methods for determining
atomic structures. Similar diffraction patterns can be produced by scattering
electrons or neutrons, which are likewise interpreted by Fourier
transformation. If single crystals of sufficient size cannot be obtained,
various other X-ray methods can be applied to obtain less detailed information;
such methods include fiber_diffraction, powder_diffraction and (if the sample
is not crystallized) small-angle_X-ray_scattering (SAXS). If the material under
investigation is only available in the form of nanocrystalline powders or
suffers from poor crystallinity, the methods of electron_crystallography can be
applied for determining the atomic structure.
For all above mentioned X-ray diffraction methods, the scattering is elastic;
the scattered X-rays have the same wavelength as the incoming X-ray. By
contrast, inelastic X-ray scattering methods are useful in studying excitations
of the sample such as plasmons, crystal-field and orbital excitations, magnons,
and phonons, rather than the distribution of its atoms.[1]

***** History[edit] *****
**** Early scientific history of crystals and X-rays[edit] ****
Drawing of square (Figure A, above) and hexagonal (Figure B, below) packing
from Kepler's work, Strena seu de Nive Sexangula.
Crystals, though long admired for their regularity and symmetry, were not
investigated scientifically until the 17th century. Johannes_Kepler
hypothesized in his work Strena seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of
Hexagonal Snow) (1611) that the hexagonal symmetry of snowflake_crystals was
due to a regular packing of spherical water particles.[2]
As shown by X-ray crystallography, the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes results
from the tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen_bonds about each water molecule.
The water molecules are arranged similarly to the silicon atoms in the
tridymite polymorph of SiO2. The resulting crystal structure has hexagonal
symmetry when viewed along a principal axis.
The Danish scientist Nicolas_Steno (1669) pioneered experimental investigations
of crystal symmetry. Steno showed that the angles between the faces are the
same in every exemplar of a particular type of crystal,[3] and RenÃ©_Just_HaÃ¼y
(1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple
stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William_Hallowes
Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small
integers, the Miller_indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal
faces. HaÃ¼y's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-
dimensional array (a Bravais_lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit
cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not
necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the
possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan_Hessel,[4] Auguste
Bravais,[5] Evgraf_Fedorov,[6] Arthur_SchÃ¶nflies[7] and (belatedly) William
Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed
several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray
crystallography;[8] however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to
accept his models as conclusive.
X-ray crystallography shows the arrangement of water molecules in ice,
revealing the hydrogen_bonds (1) that hold the solid together. Few other
methods can determine the structure of matter with such precision (resolution).
Wilhelm_RÃ¶ntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, just as the studies of crystal
symmetry were being concluded. Physicists were initially uncertain of the
nature of X-rays, but soon suspected (correctly) that they were waves of
electromagnetic_radiationâin other words, another form of light. At that
time, the wave model of lightâspecifically, the Maxwell theory of
electromagnetic_radiationâwas well accepted among scientists, and experiments
by Charles_Glover_Barkla showed that X-rays exhibited phenomena associated with
electromagnetic waves, including transverse polarization and spectral_lines
akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Single-slit experiments in
the laboratory of Arnold_Sommerfeld suggested that X-rays had a wavelength of
about 1 angstrom. However, X-rays are composed of photons, and thus are not
only waves of electromagnetic radiation but also exhibit particle-like
properties. Albert_Einstein introduced the photon concept in 1905,[9] but it
was not broadly accepted until 1922,[10][11] when Arthur_Compton confirmed it
by the scattering of X-rays from electrons.[12] Therefore, these particle-like
properties of X-rays, such as their ionization of gases, caused William_Henry
Bragg to argue in 1907 that X-rays were not electromagnetic radiation.[13][14]
[15][16] Nevertheless, Bragg's view was not broadly accepted and the
observation of X-ray_diffraction by Max_von_Laue in 1912[17] confirmed for most
scientists that X-rays were a form of electromagnetic radiation.
**** X-ray diffraction[edit] ****
The incoming beam (coming from upper left) causes each scatterer to re-radiate
a small portion of its intensity as a spherical wave. If scatterers are
arranged symmetrically with a separation d, these spherical waves will be in
sync (add constructively) only in directions where their path-length difference
2d sin Î¸ equals an integer multiple of the wavelength Î». In that case, part
of the incoming beam is deflected by an angle 2Î¸, producing a reflection spot
in the diffraction_pattern.
Crystals are regular arrays of atoms, and X-rays can be considered waves of
electromagnetic radiation. Atoms scatter X-ray waves, primarily through the
atoms' electrons. Just as an ocean wave striking a lighthouse produces
secondary circular waves emanating from the lighthouse, so an X-ray striking an
electron produces secondary spherical waves emanating from the electron. This
phenomenon is known as elastic_scattering, and the electron (or lighthouse) is
known as the scatterer. A regular array of scatterers produces a regular array
of spherical waves. Although these waves cancel one another out in most
directions through destructive_interference, they add constructively in a few
specific directions, determined by Bragg's_law:
         2 d sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; = n &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle 2d\sin \theta
      =n\lambda }  [2d \sin \theta = n \lambda]
Here d is the spacing between diffracting planes,     &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle
\theta }  [\theta ] is the incident angle, n is any integer, and Î» is the
wavelength of the beam. These specific directions appear as spots on the
diffraction_pattern called reflections. Thus, X-ray diffraction results from an
electromagnetic wave (the X-ray) impinging on a regular array of scatterers
(the repeating arrangement of atoms within the crystal).
X-rays are used to produce the diffraction pattern because their wavelength Î»
is typically the same order of magnitude (1â100 angstroms) as the spacing d
between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular
array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco_Maria
Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the
scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size.
For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was
first reported by James_Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial
diffraction_gratings for visible light were constructed by David_Rittenhouse in
1787, and Joseph_von_Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a
wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals.
Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice
planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.
The idea that crystals could be used as a diffraction_grating for X-rays arose
in 1912 in a conversation between Paul_Peter_Ewald and Max_von_Laue in the
English_Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for
his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible_light, since
the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von
Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed
to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays might have a
wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked
with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to
shine a beam of X-rays through a copper_sulfate crystal and record its
diffraction on a photographic_plate. After being developed, the plate showed a
large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting
circles around the spot produced by the central beam.[17][18] Von Laue
developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and
orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded
the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics in 1914.[19]
**** Scattering[edit] ****
As described in the mathematical_derivation_below, the X-ray scattering is
determined by the density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of
an X-ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be
modeled as Thomson_scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a
free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of
the scattered radiation.
The intensity of Thomson_scattering for one particle with mass m and elementary
charge q is:[20]
          I  o   =  I  e    (    q  4     m  2    c  4      )     1 +  cos  2
      &#x2061; 2 &#x03B8;  2   =  I  e    7.94.10  &#x2212; 26      1 +  cos  2
      &#x2061; 2 &#x03B8;  2   =  I  e   f   {\displaystyle I_{o}=I_{e}\left(
      {\frac {q^{4}}{m^{2}c^{4}}}\right){\frac {1+\cos ^{2}2\theta }{2}}=I_
      {e}7.94.10^{-26}{\frac {1+\cos ^{2}2\theta }{2}}=I_{e}f}  [
      I_o = I_e \left(\frac{q^4}{m^2c^4}\right)\frac{1+\cos^22\theta}{2} =
      I_e7.94.10^{-26}\frac{1+\cos^22\theta}{2} = I_ef
      ]
Hence the atomic nuclei, which are much heavier than an electron, contribute
negligibly to the scattered X-rays.
**** Development from 1912 to 1920[edit] ****
Although diamonds (top left) and graphite (top right) are identical in chemical
compositionâbeing both pure carbonâX-ray crystallography revealed the
arrangement of their atoms (bottom) accounts for their different properties. In
diamond, the carbon atoms are arranged tetrahedrally and held together by
single covalent_bonds, making it strong in all directions. By contrast,
graphite is composed of stacked sheets. Within the sheet, the bonding is
covalent and has hexagonal symmetry, but there are no covalent bonds between
the sheets, making graphite easy to cleave into flakes.
After Von Laue's pioneering research, the field developed rapidly, most notably
by physicists William_Lawrence_Bragg and his father William_Henry_Bragg. In
1912â1913, the younger Bragg developed Bragg's_law, which connects the
observed scattering with reflections from evenly spaced planes within the
crystal.[21][22][23] The Braggs, father and son, shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in
Physics for their work in crystallography. The earliest structures were
generally simple and marked by one-dimensional symmetry. However, as
computational and experimental methods improved over the next decades, it
became feasible to deduce reliable atomic positions for more complicated two-
and three-dimensional arrangements of atoms in the unit-cell.
The potential of X-ray crystallography for determining the structure of
molecules and mineralsâthen only known vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic
experimentsâwas realized immediately. The earliest structures were simple
inorganic crystals and minerals, but even these revealed fundamental laws of
physics and chemistry. The first atomic-resolution structure to be "solved"
(i.e., determined) in 1914 was that of table_salt.[24][25][26] The distribution
of electrons in the table-salt structure showed that crystals are not
necessarily composed of covalently_bonded molecules, and proved the existence
of ionic_compounds.[27] The structure of diamond was solved in the same year,
[28][29] proving the tetrahedral arrangement of its chemical bonds and showing
that the length of CâC single bond was 1.52 angstroms. Other early structures
included copper,[30] calcium_fluoride (CaF2, also known as fluorite), calcite
(CaCO3) and pyrite (FeS2)[31] in 1914; spinel (MgAl2O4) in 1915;[32][33] the
rutile and anatase forms of titanium_dioxide (TiO2) in 1916;[34] pyrochroite Mn
(OH)2 and, by extension, brucite Mg(OH)2 in 1919;.[35][36] Also in 1919 sodium
nitrate (NaNO3) and caesium dichloroiodide (CsICl2) were determined by Ralph
Walter_Graystone_Wyckoff, and the wurtzite (hexagonal ZnS) structure became
known in 1920.[37]
The structure of graphite was solved in 1916[38] by the related method of
powder_diffraction,[39] which was developed by Peter_Debye and Paul_Scherrer
and, independently, by Albert_Hull in 1917.[40] The structure of graphite was
determined from single-crystal diffraction in 1924 by two groups independently.
[41][42] Hull also used the powder method to determine the structures of
various metals, such as iron[43] and magnesium.[44]
**** Cultural and aesthetic importance[edit] ****
In what has been called his scientific autobiography, The Development of X-ray
Analysis, Sir William_Lawrence_Bragg mentioned that he believed the field of
crystallography was particularly welcoming to women because the techno-
aesthetics of the molecular structures resembled textiles and household
objects. Bragg was known to compare crystal formation to "curtains, wallpapers,
mosaics, and roses".[45]
In 1951, the Festival Pattern Group at the Festival_of_Britain hosted a
collaborative group of textile manufacturers and experienced crystallographers
to design lace and prints based on the X-ray crystallography of insulin, china
clay, and hemoglobin. One of the leading scientists of the project was Dr.
Helen_Megaw (1907â2002), the Assistant Director of Research at the Cavendish
Laboratory in Cambridge at the time. Megaw is credited as one of the central
figures who took inspiration from crystal diagrams and saw their potential in
design.[46] In 2008, the Wellcome Collection in London curated an exhibition on
the Festival Pattern Group called "From Atom to Patterns".[46]
***** Contributions to chemistry and material science[edit] *****
X-ray crystallography has led to a better understanding of chemical_bonds and
non-covalent_interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of
atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the
tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure,[28] the octahedral
bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV),[47] and the
resonance observed in the planar carbonate group[31] and in aromatic molecules.
[48] Kathleen_Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene[49] established
the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length
between the aliphatic CâC bonds and aromatic CâC bonds; this finding led to
the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences
for the development of chemistry.[50] Her conclusions were anticipated by
William_Henry_Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921
based on other molecules, an early form of molecular_replacement.[48][51]
Also in the 1920s, Victor_Moritz_Goldschmidt and later Linus_Pauling developed
rules for eliminating chemically unlikely structures and for determining the
relative sizes of atoms. These rules led to the structure of brookite (1928)
and an understanding of the relative stability of the rutile, brookite and
anatase forms of titanium_dioxide.
The distance between two bonded atoms is a sensitive measure of the bond
strength and its bond_order; thus, X-ray crystallographic studies have led to
the discovery of even more exotic types of bonding in inorganic_chemistry, such
as metal-metal double bonds,[52][53][54] metal-metal quadruple bonds,[55][56]
[57] and three-center, two-electron bonds.[58] X-ray crystallographyâor,
strictly speaking, an inelastic Compton_scattering experimentâhas also
provided evidence for the partly covalent character of hydrogen_bonds.[59] In
the field of organometallic_chemistry, the X-ray structure of ferrocene
initiated scientific studies of sandwich_compounds,[60][61] while that of
Zeise's_salt stimulated research into "back bonding" and metal-pi complexes.
[62][63][64][65] Finally, X-ray crystallography had a pioneering role in the
development of supramolecular_chemistry, particularly in clarifying the
structures of the crown_ethers and the principles of hostâguest_chemistry.
X-ray diffraction is a very powerful tool in catalyst development. Ex-situ
measurements are carried out routinely for checking the crystal structure of
materials or to unravel new structures. In-situ experiments give comprehensive
understanding about the structural stability of catalysts under reaction
conditions.[66][67][68]
In material sciences, many complicated inorganic and organometallic systems
have been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as fullerenes,
metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction
is also used in the pharmaceutical_industry, due to recent problems with
polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of single-crystal
structures are the crystal's size and regularity; recrystallization is a
commonly used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals.
The Cambridge_Structural_Database contains over 1,000,000 structures as of June
2019; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.
**** Mineralogy and metallurgy[edit] ****
First X-ray diffraction view of Martian_soil â CheMin_analysis reveals
feldspar, pyroxenes, olivine and more (Curiosity_rover at "Rocknest", October
17, 2012).[69]
Since the 1920s, X-ray diffraction has been the principal method for
determining the arrangement of atoms in minerals and metals. The application of
X-ray crystallography to mineralogy began with the structure of garnet, which
was determined in 1924 by Menzer. A systematic X-ray crystallographic study of
the silicates was undertaken in the 1920s. This study showed that, as the Si/
O ratio is altered, the silicate crystals exhibit significant changes in their
atomic arrangements. Machatschki extended these insights to minerals in which
aluminium substitutes for the silicon atoms of the silicates. The first
application of X-ray crystallography to metallurgy likewise occurred in the
mid-1920s.[70][71][72][73][74][75] Most notably, Linus_Pauling's structure of
the alloy Mg2Sn[76] led to his theory of the stability and structure of complex
ionic crystals.[77]
On October 17, 2012, the Curiosity_rover on the planet_Mars at "Rocknest"
performed the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian_soil. The results
from the rover's CheMin_analyzer revealed the presence of several minerals,
including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil
in the sample was similar to the "weathered basaltic_soils" of Hawaiian
volcanoes.[69]
**** Early organic and small biological molecules[edit] ****
The three-dimensional structure of penicillin, solved by Dorothy_Crowfoot
Hodgkin in 1945. The green, red, yellow and blue spheres represent atoms of
carbon, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, respectively. The white spheres represent
hydrogen, which were determined mathematically rather than by the X-ray
analysis.
The first structure of an organic compound, hexamethylenetetramine, was solved
in 1923.[78] This was followed by several studies of long-chain fatty_acids,
which are an important component of biological_membranes.[79][80][81][82][83]
[84][85][86][87] In the 1930s, the structures of much larger molecules with
two-dimensional complexity began to be solved. A significant advance was the
structure of phthalocyanine,[88] a large planar molecule that is closely
related to porphyrin_molecules important in biology, such as heme, corrin and
chlorophyll.
X-ray crystallography of biological molecules took off with Dorothy_Crowfoot
Hodgkin, who solved the structures of cholesterol (1937), penicillin (1946) and
vitamin_B12 (1956), for which she was awarded the Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry in
1964. In 1969, she succeeded in solving the structure of insulin, on which she
worked for over thirty years.[89]
**** Biological macromolecular crystallography[edit] ****
Ribbon_diagram of the structure of myoglobin, showing colored alpha_helices.
Such proteins are long, linear molecules with thousands of atoms; yet the
relative position of each atom has been determined with sub-atomic resolution
by X-ray crystallography. Since it is difficult to visualize all the atoms at
once, the ribbon shows the rough path of the protein polymer from its N-
terminus (blue) to its C-terminus (red).
Crystal structures of proteins (which are irregular and hundreds of times
larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with
the structure of sperm_whale myoglobin by Sir_John_Cowdery_Kendrew,[90] for
which he shared the Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry with Max_Perutz in 1962.[91] Since
that success, 132055 X-ray crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and
other biological molecules have been determined.[92] For comparison, the
nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear_magnetic
resonance_(NMR)_spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures.[93]
Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules,
whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70
kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine
how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes
might improve it.[94] However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging
to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize
them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization.
Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many
proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion_channels and receptors.
[95][96] Helium_cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein
crystals.[97]
On the other end of the size scale, even relatively small molecules may pose
challenges for the resolving power of X-ray crystallography. The structure
assigned in 1991 to the antibiotic isolated from a marine organism, diazonamide
A (C40H34Cl2N6O6, molar mass 765.65 g/mol), proved to be incorrect by the
classical proof of structure: a synthetic sample was not identical to the
natural product. The mistake was attributed to the inability of X-ray
crystallography to distinguish between the correct -OH / >NH and the
interchanged -NH2 / -O- groups in the incorrect structure.[98] With advances in
instrumentation, however, it is now routinely possible to distinguish between
such similar groups using modern single-crystal X-ray diffractometers.
***** Relationship to other scattering techniques[edit] *****
Further information: X-ray_scattering_techniques
**** Elastic vs. inelastic scattering[edit] ****
X-ray crystallography is a form of elastic_scattering; the outgoing X-rays have
the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with
altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is
transferred from the incoming X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-
shell electron to a higher energy_level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the
energy (or increases the wavelength) of the outgoing beam. Inelastic scattering
is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the
distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray
crystallography.
X-rays range in wavelength from 10 to 0.01 nanometers; a typical wavelength
used for crystallography is 1 Ã (0.1 nm),[99] which is on the scale of
covalent chemical_bonds and the radius of a single atom. Longer-wavelength
photons (such as ultraviolet radiation) would not have sufficient resolution to
determine the atomic positions. At the other extreme, shorter-wavelength
photons such as gamma_rays are difficult to produce in large numbers, difficult
to focus, and interact too strongly with matter, producing particle-
antiparticle_pairs. Therefore, X-rays are the "sweetspot" for wavelength when
determining atomic-resolution structures from the scattering of electromagnetic
radiation.
**** Other X-ray techniques[edit] ****
Other forms of elastic X-ray scattering include powder_diffraction, Small-Angle
X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and several types of X-ray fiber_diffraction, which was
used by Rosalind_Franklin in determining the double-helix_structure of DNA. In
general, single-crystal X-ray diffraction offers more structural information
than these other techniques; however, it requires a sufficiently large and
regular crystal, which is not always available.
These scattering methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, which are
restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-
rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) can also be used
to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is
the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering
provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray
beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time
resolved_crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic
scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore
works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.
The Laue back reflection mode records X-rays scattered backwards from a broad
spectrum source. This is useful if the sample is too thick for X-rays to
transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by
knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the
incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger_chart can be used[100] to
interpret the back reflection Laue photograph.
**** Electron and neutron diffraction[edit] ****
Other particles, such as electrons and neutrons, may be used to produce a
diffraction_pattern. Although electron, neutron, and X-ray scattering are based
on different physical processes, the resulting diffraction patterns are
analyzed using the same coherent_diffraction_imaging techniques.
As derived below, the electron density within the crystal and the diffraction
patterns are related by a simple mathematical method, the Fourier_transform,
which allows the density to be calculated relatively easily from the patterns.
However, this works only if the scattering is weak, i.e., if the scattered
beams are much less intense than the incoming beam. Weakly scattered beams pass
through the remainder of the crystal without undergoing a second scattering
event. Such re-scattered waves are called "secondary scattering" and hinder the
analysis. Any sufficiently thick crystal will produce secondary scattering, but
since X-rays interact relatively weakly with the electrons, this is generally
not a significant concern. By contrast, electron beams may produce strong
secondary scattering even for relatively thin crystals (>100 nm). Since this
thickness corresponds to the diameter of many viruses, a promising direction is
the electron diffraction of isolated macromolecular_assemblies, such as viral
capsids and molecular machines, which may be carried out with a cryo-electron
microscope. Moreover, the strong interaction of electrons with matter (about
1000 times stronger than for X-rays) allows determination of the atomic
structure of extremely small volumes. The field of applications for electron
crystallography ranges from bio molecules like membrane proteins over organic
thin films to the complex structures of (nanocrystalline) intermetallic
compounds and zeolites.
Neutron diffraction is an excellent method for structure determination,
although it has been difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of
neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear_reactors have been
used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming
increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily
from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron
scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few
electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray
diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the
solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and
heavy_water, D2O.
***** Methods[edit] *****
**** Overview of single-crystal X-ray diffraction[edit] ****
Workflow for solving the structure of a molecule by X-ray crystallography.
The oldest and most precise method of X-ray crystallography is single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal,
producing scattered beams. When they land on a piece of film or other detector,
these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of
these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated.[101] Each spot is
called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from
one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of
sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean
chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and
to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are
not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a
few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of
these oscillations.
*** Procedure[edit] ***
The technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography has three basic steps.
The firstâand often most difficultâstep is to obtain an adequate crystal of
the material under study. The crystal should be sufficiently large (typically
larger than 0.1 mm in all dimensions), pure in composition and regular in
structure, with no significant internal imperfections such as cracks or
twinning.
In the second step, the crystal is placed in an intense beam of X-rays, usually
of a single wavelength (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of
reflections. The angles and intensities of diffracted X-rays are measured, with
each compound having a unique diffraction pattern.[102] As the crystal is
gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the
intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal.
Multiple data sets may have to be collected, with each set covering slightly
more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of
thousands of reflections.
In the third step, these data are combined computationally with complementary
chemical information to produce and refine a model of the arrangement of atoms
within the crystal. The final, refined model of the atomic arrangementânow
called a crystal_structureâis usually stored in a public database.
*** Limitations[edit] ***
See also: Resolution_(electron_density)
As the crystal's repeating unit, its unit cell, becomes larger and more
complex, the atomic-level picture provided by X-ray crystallography becomes
less well-resolved (more "fuzzy") for a given number of observed reflections.
Two limiting cases of X-ray crystallographyâ"small-molecule" (which includes
continuous inorganic solids) and "macromolecular" crystallographyâare often
discerned. Small-molecule crystallography typically involves crystals with
fewer than 100 atoms in their asymmetric_unit; such crystal structures are
usually so well resolved that the atoms can be discerned as isolated "blobs" of
electron density. By contrast, macromolecular crystallography often involves
tens of thousands of atoms in the unit cell. Such crystal structures are
generally less well-resolved (more "smeared out"); the atoms and chemical bonds
appear as tubes of electron density, rather than as isolated atoms. In general,
small molecules are also easier to crystallize than macromolecules; however, X-
ray crystallography has proven possible even for viruses and proteins with
hundreds of thousands of atoms, through improved crystallographic imaging and
technology.[103] Though normally X-ray crystallography can only be performed if
the sample is in crystal form, new research has been done into sampling non-
crystalline forms of samples.[104]
**** Crystallization[edit] ****
Further information: Crystallization, Recrystallization_(chemistry)_Â§ Single
perfect_crystals_(for_X-ray_analysis), and Protein_crystallization
A protein crystal seen under a microscope. Crystals used in X-ray
crystallography may be smaller than a millimeter across.
Although crystallography can be used to characterize the disorder in an impure
or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high
regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure,
regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic materials,
such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The
regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular
crystal annealing[105][106][107] and other methods. However, in many cases,
obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its
atomic-resolution structure.[108]
Small-molecule and macromolecular crystallography differ in the range of
possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small
molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be
crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical_vapor_deposition and
recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of
freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a
stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be
crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the
range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in
which such molecules remain folded.
Three methods of preparing crystals, A: Hanging drop. B: Sitting drop. C:
Microdialysis
Protein crystals are almost always grown in solution. The most common approach
is to lower the solubility of its component molecules very gradually; if this
is done too quickly, the molecules will precipitate from solution, forming a
useless dust or amorphous gel on the bottom of the container. Crystal growth in
solution is characterized by two steps: nucleation of a microscopic crystallite
(possibly having only 100 molecules), followed by growth of that crystallite,
ideally to a diffraction-quality crystal.[109] The solution conditions that
favor the first step (nucleation) are not always the same conditions that favor
the second step (subsequent growth). The crystallographer's goal is to identify
solution conditions that favor the development of a single, large crystal,
since larger crystals offer improved resolution of the molecule. Consequently,
the solution conditions should disfavor the first step (nucleation) but favor
the second (growth), so that only one large crystal forms per droplet. If
nucleation is favored too much, a shower of small crystallites will form in the
droplet, rather than one large crystal; if favored too little, no crystal will
form whatsoever. Other approaches involves, crystallizing proteins under oil,
where aqueous protein solutions are dispensed under liquid oil, and water
evaporates through the layer of oil. Different oils have different evaporation
permeabilities, therefore yielding changes in concentration rates from
different percipient/protein mixture.[110]
It is extremely difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth
of well-ordered crystals.[111] In practice, favorable conditions are identified
by screening; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide
variety of crystallization solutions are tested.[112] Hundreds, even thousands,
of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one.
The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the
solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain
salts of the Hofmeister_series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant
of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene
glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also
common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to
gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated.
These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high
concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in
obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein,
robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing
crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume.
This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to
crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).[113]
Several factors are known to inhibit or mar crystallization. The growing
crystals are generally held at a constant temperature and protected from shocks
or vibrations that might disturb their crystallization. Impurities in the
molecules or in the crystallization solutions are often inimical to
crystallization. Conformational flexibility in the molecule also tends to make
crystallization less likely, due to entropy. Molecules that tend to self-
assemble into regular helices are often unwilling to assemble into crystals.
[citation_needed] Crystals can be marred by twinning, which can occur when a
unit cell can pack equally favorably in multiple orientations; although recent
advances in computational methods may allow solving the structure of some
twinned crystals. Having failed to crystallize a target molecule, a
crystallographer may try again with a slightly modified version of the
molecule; even small changes in molecular properties can lead to large
differences in crystallization behavior.
**** Data collection[edit] ****
*** Mounting the crystal[edit] ***
[File:Kappa goniometer animation.ogv]Play_media
Animation showing the five motions possible with a four-circle kappa
goniometer. The rotations about each of the four angles Ï, Îº, Ï and 2Î¸
leave the crystal within the X-ray beam, but change the crystal orientation.
The detector (red box) can be slid closer or further away from the crystal,
allowing higher resolution data to be taken (if closer) or better discernment
of the Bragg peaks (if further away).
The crystal is mounted for measurements so that it may be held in the X-ray
beam and rotated. There are several methods of mounting. In the past, crystals
were loaded into glass capillaries with the crystallization solution (the
mother_liquor). Nowadays, crystals of small molecules are typically attached
with oil or glue to a glass fiber or a loop, which is made of nylon or plastic
and attached to a solid rod. Protein crystals are scooped up by a loop, then
flash-frozen with liquid_nitrogen.[114] This freezing reduces the radiation
damage of the X-rays, as well as the noise in the Bragg peaks due to thermal
motion (the Debye-Waller effect). However, untreated protein crystals often
crack if flash-frozen; therefore, they are generally pre-soaked in a
cryoprotectant solution before freezing.[115] Unfortunately, this pre-soak may
itself cause the crystal to crack, ruining it for crystallography. Generally,
successful cryo-conditions are identified by trial and error.
The capillary or loop is mounted on a goniometer, which allows it to be
positioned accurately within the X-ray beam and rotated. Since both the crystal
and the beam are often very small, the crystal must be centered within the beam
to within ~25 micrometers accuracy, which is aided by a camera focused on the
crystal. The most common type of goniometer is the "kappa goniometer", which
offers three angles of rotation: the Ï angle, which rotates about an axis
perpendicular to the beam; the Îº angle, about an axis at ~50Â° to the Ï axis;
and, finally, the Ï angle about the loop/capillary axis. When the Îº angle is
zero, the Ï and Ï axes are aligned. The Îº rotation allows for convenient
mounting of the crystal, since the arm in which the crystal is mounted may be
swung out towards the crystallographer. The oscillations carried out during
data collection (mentioned below) involve the Ï axis only. An older type of
goniometer is the four-circle goniometer, and its relatives such as the six-
circle goniometer.
*** X-ray sources[edit] ***
Further information: Diffractometer, Synchrotron_light_source, and Free-
electron_laser
** Rotating anode[edit] **
Small scale can be done on a local X-ray_tube source, typically coupled with an
image_plate detector. These have the advantage of being (relatively)
inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection
of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode
material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied
and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems,
electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric
potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a
metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines
corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell_electrons of the metal. The most
common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high
thermal_conductivity, and which produces strong KÎ± and KÎ² lines. The KÎ² line
is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 Âµm) nickel foil. The simplest and
cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes_tube)
and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a
rotating-anode_type_source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.
X-rays are generally filtered (by use of X-ray_filters) to a single wavelength
(made monochromatic) and collimated to a single direction before they are
allowed to strike the crystal. The filtering not only simplifies the data
analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades the crystal without
contributing useful information. Collimation is done either with a collimator
(basically, a long tube) or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors.
Mirror systems are preferred for small crystals (under 0.3 mm) or with large
unit cells (over 150 Ã).
Rotating anodes were used by Joanna_(Joka)_Maria_Vandenberg in the first
experiments [116][117] that demonstrated the power of X rays for quick (in real
time production) screening of large InGaAsP thin_film wafers for quality
control of quantum_well_lasers.
** Synchrotron radiation[edit] **
Synchrotron_radiation sources are some of the brightest lights on earth. It is
the single most powerful tool available to X-ray crystallographers. It is made
of X-ray beams generated in large machines called synchrotrons. These machines
accelerate electrically charged particles, often electrons, to nearly the speed
of light and confine them in a (roughly) circular loop using magnetic fields.
Synchrotrons are generally national facilities, each with several dedicated
beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were
originally designed for use by high-energy physicists studying subatomic
particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is
its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a
many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned
magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons' path is bent, they emit
bursts of energy in the form of X-rays.
Using synchrotron radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray
crystallography. The intense ionizing_radiation can cause radiation_damage to
samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo_crystallography protects
the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid_nitrogen
temperatures (~100 K).[118] However, synchrotron radiation frequently has the
advantage of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous_scattering
experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is critical in experiments
such as SAD and MAD.
** Free electron laser[edit] **
Recently, free-electron_lasers have been developed for use in X-ray
crystallography.[119] These are the brightest X-ray sources currently
available; with the X-rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The intensity of the
source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for
crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source
also destroys the sample,[120] requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each
crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual
diffraction images must be collected in order to get a complete data-set. This
method, serial femtosecond crystallography, has been used in solving the
structure of a number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting
differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources.[121]
*** Recording the reflections[edit] ***
An X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystallized enzyme. The pattern of spots
(reflections) and the relative strength of each spot (intensities) can be used
to determine the structure of the enzyme.
When a crystal is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it scatters
the X-rays into a pattern of spots or reflections that can be observed on a
screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser
pointer at a compact_disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the
information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in
atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with
photographic_film, an area detector (such as a pixel_detector) or with a
charge-coupled_device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond
to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution
data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be
determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can
be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its
overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the
crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be
diagnosed quickly at this point.
One image of spots is insufficient to reconstruct the whole crystal; it
represents only a small slice of the full Fourier transform. To collect all the
necessary information, the crystal must be rotated step-by-step through 180Â°,
with an image recorded at every step; actually, slightly more than 180Â° is
required to cover reciprocal space, due to the curvature of the Ewald_sphere.
However, if the crystal has a higher symmetry, a smaller angular range such as
90Â° or 45Â° may be recorded. The rotation axis should be changed at least
once, to avoid developing a "blind spot" in reciprocal space close to the
rotation axis. It is customary to rock the crystal slightly (by 0.5â2Â°) to
catch a broader region of reciprocal space.
Multiple data sets may be necessary for certain phasing methods. For example,
MAD phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three (and
usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths of the incoming X-ray radiation. A
single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set,
owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must
be taken.[122]
**** Data analysis[edit] ****
*** Crystal symmetry, unit cell, and image scaling[edit] ***
Further information: Space_group
The recorded series of two-dimensional diffraction patterns, each corresponding
to a different crystal orientation, is converted into a three-dimensional model
of the electron density; the conversion uses the mathematical technique of
Fourier transforms, which is explained below. Each spot corresponds to a
different type of variation in the electron density; the crystallographer must
determine which variation corresponds to which spot (indexing), the relative
strengths of the spots in different images (merging and scaling) and how the
variations should be combined to yield the total electron density (phasing).
Data processing begins with indexing the reflections. This means identifying
the dimensions of the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which
position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the
symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space_group. Some space groups can be
eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be
observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are
allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is
generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine.[123] Having assigned
symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images
containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at
the very least) records of the Miller_index of each reflection, and an
intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error
estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was
recorded on that image)).
A full data set may consist of hundreds of separate images taken at different
orientations of the crystal. The first step is to merge and scale these various
images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging)
and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity
scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative
intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is
determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and
the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to
record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows
calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how
similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections,
[clarification_needed] thus assessing the quality of the data.
*** Initial phasing[edit] ***
Further information: Phase_problem
The data collected from a diffraction experiment is a reciprocal_space
representation of the crystal lattice. The position of each diffraction 'spot'
is governed by the size and shape of the unit cell, and the inherent symmetry
within the crystal. The intensity of each diffraction 'spot' is recorded, and
this intensity is proportional to the square of the structure factor amplitude.
The structure_factor is a complex_number containing information relating to
both the amplitude and phase of a wave. In order to obtain an interpretable
electron density map, both amplitude and phase must be known (an electron
density map allows a crystallographer to build a starting model of the
molecule). The phase cannot be directly recorded during a diffraction
experiment: this is known as the phase_problem. Initial phase estimates can be
obtained in a variety of ways:
    * Ab_initio phasing or direct_methods â This is usually the method of
      choice for small molecules (<1000 non-hydrogen atoms), and has been used
      successfully to solve the phase problems for small proteins. If the
      resolution of the data is better than 1.4 Ã (140 pm), direct_methods can
      be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase
      relationships between certain groups of reflections.[124][125]
    * Molecular_replacement â if a related structure is known, it can be used
      as a search model in molecular replacement to determine the orientation
      and position of the molecules within the unit cell. The phases obtained
      this way can be used to generate electron density maps.[126]
    * Anomalous_X-ray_scattering (MAD or SAD_phasing) â the X-ray wavelength
      may be scanned past an absorption edge[when_defined_as?] of an atom,
      which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of
      reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above and in
      the middle of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of
      the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole
      molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering
      atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph
      (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-
      methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be
      conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the
      position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial
      phases.[127]
    * Heavy atom methods (multiple_isomorphous_replacement) â If electron-
      dense metal atoms can be introduced into the crystal, direct_methods or
      Patterson-space_methods can be used to determine their location and to
      obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by
      soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-
      crystallization (growing the crystals in the presence of a heavy atom).
      As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be
      interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by
      which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been
      superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.[126]
*** Model building and phase refinement[edit] ***

experimental data, and the ligand is modeled into this electron density.
Further information: Molecular_modeling
Having obtained initial phases, an initial model can be built. The atomic
positions in the model and their respective Debye-Waller_factors (or B-factors,
accounting for the thermal motion of the atom) can be refined to fit the
observed diffraction data, ideally yielding a better set of phases. A new model
can then be fit to the new electron density map and successive rounds of
refinement is carried out. This interative process continues until the
correlation between the diffraction data and the model is maximized. The
agreement is measured by an R-factor defined as
         R =     &#x2211;  all reflections    |   F  obs   &#x2212;  F  calc
      |     &#x2211;  all reflections    |  F  obs   |     ,   {\displaystyle
      R={\frac {\sum _{\text{all reflections}}\left|F_{\text{obs}}-F_{\text
      {calc}}\right|}{\sum _{\text{all reflections}}\left|F_{\text
      {obs}}\right|}},}  [{\displaystyle R={\frac {\sum _{\text{all
      reflections}}\left|F_{\text{obs}}-F_{\text{calc}}\right|}{\sum _{\text
      {all reflections}}\left|F_{\text{obs}}\right|}},}]
where F is the structure_factor. A similar quality criterion is Rfree, which is
calculated from a subset (~10%) of reflections that were not included in the
structure refinement. Both R factors depend on the resolution of the data. As a
rule of thumb, Rfree should be approximately the resolution in angstroms
divided by 10; thus, a data-set with 2 Ã resolution should yield a final Rfree
~ 0.2. Chemical bonding features such as stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding and
distribution of bond lengths and angles are complementary measures of the model
quality. Phase bias is a serious problem in such iterative model building. Omit
maps are a common technique used to check for this.[clarification_needed]
It may not be possible to observe every atom in the asymmetric unit. In many
cases, Crystallographic_disorder smears the electron density map. Weakly
scattering atoms such as hydrogen are routinely invisible. It is also possible
for a single atom to appear multiple times in an electron density map, e.g., if
a protein sidechain has multiple (<4) allowed conformations. In still other
cases, the crystallographer may detect that the covalent structure deduced for
the molecule was incorrect, or changed. For example, proteins may be cleaved or
undergo post-translational modifications that were not detected prior to the
crystallization.
*** Disorder[edit] ***
Main article: crystallographic_disorder
A common challenge in refinement of crystal structures results from
crystallographic disorder. Disorder can take many forms but in general involves
the coexistence of two or more species or conformations. Failure to recognize
disorder results in flawed interpretation. Pitfalls from improper modeling of
disorder are illustrated by the discounted hypothesis of bond_stretch
isomerism.[130] Disorder is modelled with respect to the relative population of
the components, often only two, and their identity. In structures of large
molecules and ions, solvent and counterions are often disordered.
*** Applied computational data analysis[edit] ***
The use of computational methods for the powder X-ray diffraction data analysis
is now generalized. It typically compares the experimental data to the
simulated diffractogram of a model structure, taking into account the
instrumental parameters, and refines the structural or microstructural
parameters of the model using least_squares based minimization algorithm. Most
available tools allowing phase identification and structural refinement are
based on the Rietveld_method,[131][132] some of them being open and free
software such as FullProf Suite,[133][134] Jana2006,[135] MAUD,[136][137][138]
Rietan,[139] GSAS,[140] etc. while others are available under commercials
licenses such as Diffrac.Suite TOPAS,[141] Match!,[142] etc. Most of these
tools also allow Le_Bail_refinement (also referred to as profile matching),
that is, refinement of the cell parameters based on the Bragg peaks positions
and peak profiles, without taking into account the crystallographic structure
by itself. More recent tools allow the refinement of both structural and
microstructural data, such as the FAULTS program included in the FullProf
Suite,[143] which allows the refinement of structures with planar defects (e.g.
stacking faults, twinnings, intergrowths).
**** Deposition of the structure[edit] ****
Once the model of a molecule's structure has been finalized, it is often
deposited in a crystallographic_database such as the Cambridge_Structural
Database (for small molecules), the Inorganic_Crystal_Structure_Database_(ICSD)
(for inorganic compounds) or the Protein_Data_Bank (for protein and sometimes
nucleic acids). Many structures obtained in private commercial ventures to
crystallize medicinally relevant proteins are not deposited in public
crystallographic databases.
***** Diffraction theory[edit] *****
Further information: Dynamical_theory_of_diffraction and Bragg_diffraction
The main goal of X-ray crystallography is to determine the density of electrons
f(r) throughout the crystal, where r represents the three-dimensional position
vector within the crystal. To do this, X-ray scattering is used to collect data
about its Fourier transform F(q), which is inverted mathematically to obtain
the density defined in real space, using the formula
         f (  r  ) =   1   (  2 &#x03C0;  )   3     &#x222B; F (  q  )  e   i
      q  &#x22C5;  r     d   q  ,   {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}
      {\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\int F(\mathbf {q} )e^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {q}
      \cdot \mathbf {r} }\mathrm {d} \mathbf {q} ,}  [{\displaystyle f(\mathbf
      {r} )={\frac {1}{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\int F(\mathbf {q} )e^{\mathrm
      {i} \mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r} }\mathrm {d} \mathbf {q} ,}]
where the integral is taken over all values of q. The three-dimensional real
vector q represents a point in reciprocal_space, that is, to a particular
oscillation in the electron density as one moves in the direction in which q
points. The length of q corresponds to     2 &#x03C0;   {\displaystyle 2\pi }
[2\pi ] divided by the wavelength of the oscillation. The corresponding formula
for a Fourier transform will be used below
         F (  q  ) = &#x222B; f (  r  )   e   &#x2212;  i   q  &#x22C5;  r
      d   r  ,   {\displaystyle F(\mathbf {q} )=\int f(\mathbf {r} )\mathrm {e}
      ^{-\mathrm {i} \mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r} }\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} ,}
      [{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {q} )=\int f(\mathbf {r} )\mathrm {e} ^{-
      \mathrm {i} \mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r} }\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} ,}]
where the integral is summed over all possible values of the position vector r
within the crystal.
The Fourier transform F(q) is generally a complex_number, and therefore has a
magnitude |F(q)| and a phase Ï(q) related by the equation
         F (  q  ) =  |  F (  q  )  |    e    i  &#x03D5; (  q  )   .
      {\displaystyle F(\mathbf {q} )=\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^
      {\mathrm {i} \phi (\mathbf {q} )}.}  [{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {q}
      )=\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \phi (\mathbf {q}
      )}.}]
The intensities of the reflections observed in X-ray diffraction give us the
magnitudes |F(q)| but not the phases Ï(q). To obtain the phases, full sets of
reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by
modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly
scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury. Combining the
magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform F(q), which may be
inverted to obtain the electron density f(r).
Crystals are often idealized as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case,
the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is
perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q
belongs to the reciprocal_lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality,
however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean
position, and there may be disorder of various types, such as mosaicity,
dislocations, various point_defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of
crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and
there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays
that fall between the Bragg peaks.
**** Intuitive understanding by Bragg's law[edit] ****
An intuitive understanding of X-ray diffraction can be obtained from the Bragg
model_of_diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a
set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing
through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a
particular set of sheets is identified by its three_Miller_indices (h, k, l),
and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in
which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each
plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine
constructively (constructive_interference) when the angle Î¸ between the plane
and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n
of the X-ray wavelength Î».
         2 d sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; = n &#x03BB; .   {\displaystyle 2d\sin
      \theta =n\lambda .}  [{\displaystyle 2d\sin \theta =n\lambda .}]
A reflection is said to be indexed when its Miller indices (or, more correctly,
its reciprocal_lattice vector components) have been identified from the known
wavelength and the scattering angle 2Î¸. Such indexing gives the unit-cell
parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space
group. Since Bragg's_law does not interpret the relative intensities of the
reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement
of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be
carried out.
**** Scattering as a Fourier transform[edit] ****
The incoming X-ray beam has a polarization and should be represented as a
vector wave; however, for simplicity, let it be represented here as a scalar
wave. We also ignore the complication of the time dependence of the wave and
just concentrate on the wave's spatial dependence. Plane_waves can be
represented by a wave_vector kin, and so the strength of the incoming wave at
time t = 0 is given by
         A   e    i    k    i n    &#x22C5;  r    .   {\displaystyle A\mathrm
      {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {k} _{\mathrm {in} }\cdot \mathbf {r} }.}  [
      {\displaystyle A\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {k} _{\mathrm {in}
      }\cdot \mathbf {r} }.}]
At position r within the sample, let there be a density of scatterers f(r);
these scatterers should produce a scattered spherical wave of amplitude
proportional to the local amplitude of the incoming wave times the number of
scatterers in a small volume dV about r
          amplitude of scattered wave  = A   e    i   k  &#x22C5;  r    S f
      (  r  )  d  V ,   {\displaystyle {\text{amplitude of scattered
      wave}}=A\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} }Sf
      (\mathbf {r} )\mathrm {d} V,}  [{\displaystyle {\text{amplitude of
      scattered wave}}=A\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r}
      }Sf(\mathbf {r} )\mathrm {d} V,}]
where S is the proportionality constant.
Consider the fraction of scattered waves that leave with an outgoing wave-
vector of kout and strike the screen at rscreen. Since no energy is lost
(elastic, not inelastic scattering), the wavelengths are the same as are the
magnitudes of the wave-vectors |kin|=|kout|. From the time that the photon is
scattered at r until it is absorbed at rscreen, the photon undergoes a change
in phase
          e  i   k   out   &#x22C5;  (    r   screen   &#x2212;  r   )    .
      {\displaystyle e^{i\mathbf {k} _{\text{out}}\cdot \left(\mathbf {r} _
      {\text{screen}}-\mathbf {r} \right)}.}  [{\displaystyle e^{i\mathbf {k} _
      {\text{out}}\cdot \left(\mathbf {r} _{\text{screen}}-\mathbf {r}
      \right)}.}]
The net radiation arriving at rscreen is the sum of all the scattered waves
throughout the crystal
         A S &#x222B;  d   r  f (  r  )   e    i    k   in   &#x22C5;  r     e

      {i\mathbf {k} _{\text{out}}\cdot \mathbf {r} _{\text{screen}}}\int
      \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} f(\mathbf {r} )\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \left

      {\mathrm {i} \left(\mathbf {k} _{\text{in}}-\mathbf {k} _{\text

which may be written as a Fourier transform
         A S   e    i    k   out   &#x22C5;   r   screen     &#x222B; d  r  f

      {i} \mathbf {k} _{\text{out}}\cdot \mathbf {r} _{\text{screen}}}F(\mathbf
      {q} ),}]
where q = kout â kin. The measured intensity of the reflection will be square
of this amplitude
          A  2    S  2     |  F (  q  )  |   2   .   {\displaystyle A^{2}S^
      {2}\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle A^{2}S^{2}\left|F
      (\mathbf {q} )\right|^{2}.}]
**** Friedel and Bijvoet mates[edit] ****
For every reflection corresponding to a point q in the reciprocal space, there
is another reflection of the same intensity at the opposite point -q. This
opposite reflection is known as the Friedel mate of the original reflection.
This symmetry results from the mathematical fact that the density of electrons
f(r) at a position r is always a real_number. As noted above, f(r) is the
inverse transform of its Fourier transform F(q); however, such an inverse
transform is a complex_number in general. To ensure that f(r) is real, the
Fourier transform F(q) must be such that the Friedel mates F(âq) and F(q) are
complex_conjugates of one another. Thus, F(âq) has the same magnitude as F(q)
but they have the opposite phase, i.e., Ï(q) = âÏ(q)
         F ( &#x2212;  q  ) =  |  F ( &#x2212;  q  )  |    e    i  &#x03D5;
      ( &#x2212;  q  )   =  F  &#x2217;   (  q  ) =  |  F (  q  )  |    e
      &#x2212;  i  &#x03D5; (  q  )   .   {\displaystyle F(-\mathbf {q}
      )=\left|F(-\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \phi (-\mathbf
      {q} )}=F^{*}(\mathbf {q} )=\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{-
      \mathrm {i} \phi (\mathbf {q} )}.}  [{\displaystyle F(-\mathbf {q}
      )=\left|F(-\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \phi (-\mathbf
      {q} )}=F^{*}(\mathbf {q} )=\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{-
      \mathrm {i} \phi (\mathbf {q} )}.}]
The equality of their magnitudes ensures that the Friedel mates have the same
intensity |F|2. This symmetry allows one to measure the full Fourier transform
from only half the reciprocal space, e.g., by rotating the crystal slightly
more than 180Â° instead of a full 360Â° revolution. In crystals with
significant symmetry, even more reflections may have the same intensity
(Bijvoet mates); in such cases, even less of the reciprocal space may need to
be measured. In favorable cases of high symmetry, sometimes only 90Â° or even
only 45Â° of data are required to completely explore the reciprocal space.
The Friedel-mate constraint can be derived from the definition of the inverse
Fourier transform
         f (  r  ) = &#x222B;    d  q     (  2 &#x03C0;  )   3     F (  q  )
      e    i   q  &#x22C5;  r    = &#x222B;    d  q     (  2 &#x03C0;  )   3
      |  F (  q  )  |    e    i  &#x03D5; (  q  )     e    i   q  &#x22C5;  r
      .   {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {r} )=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi
      \right)^{3}}}F(\mathbf {q} )\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {q} \cdot
      \mathbf {r} }=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\left|F
      (\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \phi (\mathbf {q}
      )}\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r} }.}  [
      {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {r} )=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi
      \right)^{3}}}F(\mathbf {q} )\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {q} \cdot
      \mathbf {r} }=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\left|F
      (\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \phi (\mathbf {q}
      )}\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r} }.}]
Since Euler's_formula states that eix = cos(x) + i sin(x), the inverse Fourier
transform can be separated into a sum of a purely real part and a purely
imaginary part
         f (  r  ) = &#x222B;    d  q     (  2 &#x03C0;  )   3      |  F (  q
      )  |    e    i   (  &#x03D5; +  q  &#x22C5;  r   )    = &#x222B;    d  q
      (  2 &#x03C0;  )   3      |  F (  q  )  |  cos &#x2061;  (  &#x03D5; +  q
      &#x22C5;  r   )  + i &#x222B;    d  q     (  2 &#x03C0;  )   3      |  F
      (  q  )  |  sin &#x2061;  (  &#x03D5; +  q  &#x22C5;  r   )  =  I   c o s

      {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\left|F(\mathbf {q}
      )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \left(\phi +\mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf
      {r} \right)}=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\left|F
      (\mathbf {q} )\right|\cos \left(\phi +\mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r}
      \right)+i\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\left|F
      (\mathbf {q} )\right|\sin \left(\phi +\mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r}
      \right)=I_{\mathrm {cos} }+iI_{\mathrm {sin} }.}  [{\displaystyle f
      (\mathbf {r} )=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^
      {3}}}\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \left(\phi
      +\mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r} \right)}=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left

      \cdot \mathbf {r} \right)=I_{\mathrm {cos} }+iI_{\mathrm {sin} }.}]
The function f(r) is real if and only if the second integral Isin is zero for
all values of r. In turn, this is true if and only if the above constraint is
satisfied
          I  sin   = &#x222B;    d  q     (  2 &#x03C0;  )   3      |  F (  q
      )  |  sin &#x2061;  (  &#x03D5; +  q  &#x22C5;  r   )  = &#x222B;    d  q

      {3}}}\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|\sin \left(\phi +\mathbf {q} \cdot
      \mathbf {r} \right)=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^
      {3}}}\left|F(\mathbf {-q} )\right|\sin \left(-\phi -\mathbf {q} \cdot
      \mathbf {r} \right)=-I_{\sin },}  [{\displaystyle I_{\sin }=\int {\frac
      {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|\sin

      {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}\left|F(\mathbf {-q} )\right|\sin \left(-
      \phi -\mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r} \right)=-I_{\sin },}]
since Isin = âIsin implies that Isin = 0.
**** Ewald's sphere[edit] ****
Further information: Ewald's_sphere
Each X-ray diffraction image represents only a slice, a spherical slice of
reciprocal space, as may be seen by the Ewald sphere construction. Both kout
and kin have the same length, due to the elastic scattering, since the
wavelength has not changed. Therefore, they may be represented as two radial
vectors in a sphere in reciprocal_space, which shows the values of q that are
sampled in a given diffraction image. Since there is a slight spread in the
incoming wavelengths of the incoming X-ray beam, the values of|F(q)|can be
measured only for q vectors located between the two spheres corresponding to
those radii. Therefore, to obtain a full set of Fourier transform data, it is
necessary to rotate the crystal through slightly more than 180Â°, or sometimes
less if sufficient symmetry is present. A full 360Â° rotation is not needed
because of a symmetry intrinsic to the Fourier transforms of real functions
(such as the electron density), but "slightly more" than 180Â° is needed to
cover all of reciprocal space within a given resolution because of the
curvature of the Ewald_sphere. In practice, the crystal is rocked by a small
amount (0.25â1Â°) to incorporate reflections near the boundaries of the
spherical Ewald's shells.
**** Patterson function[edit] ****
Further information: Patterson_function
A well-known result of Fourier transforms is the autocorrelation theorem, which
states that the autocorrelation c(r) of a function f(r)
         c (  r  ) = &#x222B; d  x  f (  x  ) f (  x  +  r  ) = &#x222B;    d
      q     (  2 &#x03C0;  )   3     C (  q  )  e  i  q  &#x22C5;  r
      {\displaystyle c(\mathbf {r} )=\int d\mathbf {x} f(\mathbf {x} )f(\mathbf
      {x} +\mathbf {r} )=\int {\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}}C
      (\mathbf {q} )e^{i\mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {r} }}  [c(\mathbf{r}) = \int
      d\mathbf{x} f(\mathbf{x}) f(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{r}) = \int \frac
      {d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} C(\mathbf{q}) e^{i\mathbf
      {q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}]
has a Fourier transform C(q) that is the squared magnitude of F(q)
         C (  q  ) =   |  F (  q  )  |   2   .   {\displaystyle C(\mathbf {q}
      )=\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle C(\mathbf {q}
      )=\left|F(\mathbf {q} )\right|^{2}.}]
Therefore, the autocorrelation function c(r) of the electron density (also
known as the Patterson function[144]) can be computed directly from the
reflection intensities, without computing the phases. In principle, this could
be used to determine the crystal structure directly; however, it is difficult
to realize in practice. The autocorrelation function corresponds to the
distribution of vectors between atoms in the crystal; thus, a crystal of N
atoms in its unit cell may have N(N â 1) peaks in its Patterson function.
Given the inevitable errors in measuring the intensities, and the mathematical
difficulties of reconstructing atomic positions from the interatomic vectors,
this technique is rarely used to solve structures, except for the simplest
crystals.
**** Advantages of a crystal[edit] ****
In principle, an atomic structure could be determined from applying X-ray
scattering to non-crystalline samples, even to a single molecule. However,
crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline
sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit_cells
repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems
have a Fourier_transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points
in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the
reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at
these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed
intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words,
using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells
into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the
noise. This is an example of constructive_interference.
In a liquid, powder or amorphous sample, molecules within that sample are in
random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that
uniformly spreads its amplitude thereby reducing the measured signal intensity,
as is observed in SAXS. More importantly, the orientational information is
lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain
atomic-resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules from such
rotationally averaged data. An intermediate case is fiber_diffraction in which
the subunits are arranged periodically in at least one dimension.

***** Applications of X-ray diffraction[edit] *****
X-ray diffraction has wide and various applications in the chemical,
biochemical, physical, material and mineralogical sciences. Laue claimed in
1937 that the technique "has extended the power of observing minute structure
ten thousand times beyond that given us by the microscope".[159] X-ray
diffraction is analogous to a microscope with atomic-level resolution which
shows the atoms and their electron distribution.
X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction, and neutron diffraction give
information about the structure of matter, crystalline and non-crystalline, at
the atomic and molecular level. In addition, these methods may be applied in
the study of properties of all materials, inorganic, organic or biological. Due
to the importance and variety of applications of diffraction studies of
crystals, many Nobel Prizes have been awarded for such studies.[160]
**** X-ray method for investigation of drugs[edit] ****
X-ray diffraction has been used for the identification of antibiotic drugs such
as: eight Î²-lactam (ampicillin_sodium, penicillin_G_procaine, cefalexin,
ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine_penicillin, benzylpenicillin_sodium,
cefotaxime_sodium, Ceftriaxone_sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline
hydrochloride, oxytetracycline_dehydrate, tetracycline_hydrochloride) and two
macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin_estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these
drugs has a unique X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern that makes their
identification possible.[161]
**** X-ray method for investigation of textile fibers and polymers[edit] ****
Forensic_examination of any trace evidence is based upon Locard's_exchange
principle. This states that "every contact leaves a trace". In practice, even
though a transfer of material has taken place, it may be impossible to detect,
because the amount transferred is very small.[162]
Textile fibers are a mixture of crystalline and amorphous substances.
Therefore, the measurement of the degree of crystalline gives useful data in
the characterization of fibers using X-ray diffractometry. It has been reported
that X-ray diffraction was used to identify of a "crystalline" deposit which
was found on a chair. The deposit was found to be amorphous, but the
diffraction pattern present matched that of polymethylmethacrylate. Pyrolysis
mass_spectrometry later identified the deposit as polymethylcyanoacrylaon of
Boin crystal parameters.[163]
**** X-ray method for investigation of bones[edit] ****
Heating or burning of bones causes recognizable changes in the bone mineral
that can be detected using XRD techniques. During the first 15 minutes of
heating at 500 Â°C or above, the bone crystals began to change. At higher
temperatures, thickness and shape of crystals of bones appear stabilized, but
when the samples were heated at a lower temperature or for a shorter period,
XRD traces showed extreme changes in crystal parameters.[164]
**** Integrated circuits[edit] ****
X-ray diffraction has been demonstrated as a method for investigating the
complex structure of integrated_circuits.[165]
