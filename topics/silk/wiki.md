A silk-producing raspy_cricket
Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into
textiles. The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is
produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons.[1] The best-known silk is
obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx_mori
reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to
the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth
to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.
Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth
caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. There has been some
research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level.[2] Silk
is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete_metamorphosis,
but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy_crickets, produce silk
throughout their lives.[3] Silk production also occurs in Hymenoptera (bees,
wasps, and ants), silverfish, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles,
lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges.[2] Other types of arthropods produce silk,
most notably various arachnids, such as spiders.

***** Etymology *****
The word silk comes from Old_English: sioloc, from Ancient_Greek:
ÏÎ·ÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ, romanized: sÄrikÃ³s, "silken", ultimately from an Asian source
â compare Mandarin sÄ« "silk", Manchurian sirghe, Mongolian sirkek.[4]

**** Wild silk ****
Main article: Wild_silk
Woven silk textile from tomb no 1. at Mawangdui in Changsha, Hunan province,
China, from the Western_Han_dynasty, 2nd century BC
Several kinds of wild_silk, which are produced by caterpillars other than the
mulberry silkworm, have been known and used in China, South_Asia, and Europe
since ancient times. However, the scale of production was always far smaller
than for cultivated silks. There are several reasons for this: first, they
differ from the domesticated varieties in colour and texture and are therefore
less uniform; second, cocoons gathered in the wild have usually had the pupa
emerge from them before being discovered so the silk thread that makes up the
cocoon has been torn into shorter lengths; and third, many wild cocoons are
covered in a mineral layer that prevents attempts to reel from them long
strands of silk.[5] Thus, the only way to obtain silk suitable for spinning
into textiles in areas where commercial silks are not cultivated was by tedious
and labor-intensive carding.
Commercial silks originate from reared silkworm pupae, which are bred to
produce a white-colored silk thread with no mineral on the surface. The pupae
are killed by either dipping them in boiling water before the adult moths
emerge or by piercing them with a needle. These factors all contribute to the
ability of the whole cocoon to be unravelled as one continuous thread,
permitting a much stronger cloth to be woven from the silk. Wild silks also
tend to be more difficult to dye than silk from the cultivated silkworm.[6][7]
A technique known as demineralizing allows the mineral layer around the cocoon
of wild silk moths to be removed,[8] leaving only variability in color as a
barrier to creating a commercial silk industry based on wild silks in the parts
of the world where wild silk moths thrive, such as in Africa and South America.

Silk was first developed in ancient China.[9][10]
The earliest example of silk has been found in tombs at the neolithic site
Jiahu in Henan, and dates back 8,500 years.[11][12] Silk fabric from 3630 BC
was used as wrapping for the body of a child from a Yangshao_culture site in
Qingtaicun at Xingyang, Henan.[9][13]
Legend gives credit for developing silk to a Chinese empress, Leizu (Hsi-Ling-
Shih, Lei-Tzu). Silks were originally reserved for the Emperors of China for
their own use and gifts to others, but spread gradually through Chinese_culture
and trade both geographically and socially, and then to many regions of Asia.
Because of its texture and lustre, silk rapidly became a popular luxury fabric
in the many areas accessible to Chinese merchants. Silk was in great demand,
and became a staple of pre-industrial international trade. In July 2007,
archaeologists discovered intricately woven and dyed silk textiles in a tomb in
Jiangxi province, dated to the Eastern Zhou_dynasty roughly 2,500 years ago.
[14] Although historians have suspected a long history of a formative textile
industry in ancient China, this find of silk textiles employing "complicated
techniques" of weaving and dyeing provides direct evidence for silks dating
before the Mawangdui-discovery and other silks dating to the Han_dynasty (202
BC â 220 AD).[14]
Silk is described in a chapter of the Fan_Shengzhi_shu from the Western Han
(202 BC â 9 AD). There is a surviving calendar for silk production in an
Eastern Han (25â220 AD) document. The two other known works on silk from the
Han period are lost.[9] The first evidence of the long distance silk trade is
the finding of silk in the hair of an Egyptian mummy of the 21st dynasty,
c.1070 BC.[15] The silk trade reached as far as the Indian_subcontinent, the
Middle_East, Europe, and North_Africa. This trade was so extensive that the
major set of trade routes between Europe and Asia came to be known as the Silk
Road.
The Emperors_of_China strove to keep knowledge of sericulture secret to
maintain the Chinese monopoly. Nonetheless sericulture reached Korea with
technological aid from China around 200 BC,[16] the ancient Kingdom_of_Khotan
by AD 50,[17] and India by AD 140.[18]
In the ancient era, silk from China was the most lucrative and sought-after
luxury item traded across the Eurasian continent,[19] and many civilizations,
such as the ancient Persians, benefited economically from trade.[19]

Silk has a long history in India. It is known as Resham in eastern and north
India, and Pattu in southern parts of India. Recent archaeological discoveries
in Harappa and Chanhu-daro suggest that sericulture, employing wild_silk
threads from native silkworm species, existed in South_Asia during the time of
the Indus_Valley_Civilization (now in Pakistan) dating between 2450 BC and 2000
BC, while "hard and fast evidence" for silk production in China dates back to
around 2570 BC.[20][21] Shelagh Vainker, a silk expert at the Ashmolean_Museum
in Oxford, who sees evidence for silk production in China "significantly
earlier" than 2500â2000 BC, suggests, "people of the Indus civilization
either harvested silkworm cocoons or traded with people who did, and that they
knew a considerable amount about silk."[20]
India is the second largest producer of silk in the world after China. About
97% of the raw mulberry silk comes from six Indian states, namely, Andhra
Pradesh, Karnataka, Jammu_and_Kashmir, Tamil_Nadu, Bihar and West_Bengal.[22]
North Bangalore, the upcoming site of a $20 million "Silk City" Ramanagara and
Mysore, contribute to a majority of silk production in Karnataka.[23]

In Tamil_Nadu, mulberry cultivation is concentrated in the Coimbatore, Erode,
Bhagalpuri, Tiruppur, Salem and Dharmapuri districts. Hyderabad, Andhra
Pradesh, and Gobichettipalayam, Tamil_Nadu, were the first locations to have
automated silk reeling units in India.[24]
India is also the largest consumer of silk in the world. The tradition of
wearing silk sarees for marriages and other auspicious ceremonies is a custom
in Assam and southern parts of India. Silk is considered to be a symbol of
royalty, and, historically, silk was used primarily by the upper classes. Silk
garments and sarees produced in Kanchipuram, Pochampally, Dharmavaram, Mysore,
Arani in the south, Banaras in the north, Bhagalpur and Murshidabad in the east
are well recognized. In the northeastern state of Assam, three different types
of silk are produced, collectively called Assam_silk: Muga, Eri and Pat silk.
Muga, the golden silk, and Eri are produced by silkworms that are native only
to Assam.
**** Thailand ****
Main article: Thai_silk
Silk is produced year-round in Thailand by two types of silkworms, the cultured
Bombycidae and wild Saturniidae. Most production is after the rice harvest in
the southern and northeastern parts of the country. Women traditionally weave
silk on hand looms and pass the skill on to their daughters, as weaving is
considered to be a sign of maturity and eligibility for marriage. Thai silk
textiles often use complicated patterns in various colours and styles. Most
regions of Thailand have their own typical silks. A single thread filament is
too thin to use on its own so women combine many threads to produce a thicker,
usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a wooden spindle to
produce a uniform strand of raw silk. The process takes around 40 hours to
produce a half kilogram of silk. Many local operations use a reeling machine
for this task, but some silk threads are still hand-reeled. The difference is
that hand-reeled threads produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are
ideal for lightweight fabrics, and a thick grade for heavier material.
The silk fabric is soaked in extremely cold water and bleached before dyeing to
remove the natural yellow coloring of Thai silk yarn. To do this, skeins of
silk thread are immersed in large tubs of hydrogen_peroxide. Once washed and
dried, the silk is woven on a traditional hand-operated loom.[25]

The Rajshahi_Division of northern Bangladesh is the hub of the country's silk
industry. There are three types of silk produced in the region: mulberry, endi
and tassar. Bengali silk was a major item of international trade for centuries.
It was known as Ganges silk in medieval Europe. Bengal was the leading exporter
of silk between the 16th and 19th centuries.[26]

The Gunthertuch, an 11th-century silk celebrating a Byzantine_emperor's triumph
In the Odyssey, 19.233, when Odysseus, while pretending to be someone else, is
questioned by Penelope about her husband's clothing, he says that he wore a
shirt "gleaming like the skin of a dried onion" (varies with translations,
literal translation here)[27] which could refer to the lustrous quality of silk
fabric. Aristotle wrote of Coa_vestis, a wild silk textile from Kos. Sea_silk
from certain large sea shells was also valued. The Roman_Empire knew of and
traded in silk, and Chinese silk was the most highly priced luxury good
imported by them.[19] During the reign of emperor Tiberius, sumptuary_laws were
passed that forbade men from wearing silk garments, but these proved
ineffectual.[28] The Historia_Augusta mentions that the third-century emperor
Elagabalus was the first Roman to wear garments of pure silk, whereas it had
been customary to wear fabrics of silk/cotton or silk/linen blends.[29] Despite
the popularity of silk, the secret of silk-making only reached Europe around AD
550, via the Byzantine_Empire. Legend has it that monks working for the emperor
Justinian_I smuggled_silkworm_eggs to Constantinople in hollow canes from
China. All top-quality looms and weavers were located inside the Great_Palace
complex in Constantinople, and the cloth produced was used in imperial robes or
in diplomacy, as gifts to foreign dignitaries. The remainder was sold at very
high prices.
**** Middle East ****
In the Torah, a scarlet cloth item called in Hebrew "sheni tola'at" ×©× ×
×ª×××¢×ª â literally "crimson of the worm" â is described as being used
in purification ceremonies, such as those following a leprosy outbreak
(Leviticus 14), alongside cedar wood and hyssop (za'atar). Eminent scholar and
leading medieval translator of Jewish sources and books of the Bible into
Arabic, Rabbi Saadia_Gaon, translates this phrase explicitly as "crimson silk"
â ××¨××¨ ×§×¨×× Ø­Ø±ÙØ± ÙØ±ÙØ².
In Islamic teachings, Muslim men are forbidden to wear silk. Many religious
jurists believe the reasoning behind the prohibition lies in avoiding clothing
for men that can be considered feminine or extravagant.[30] There are disputes
regarding the amount of silk a fabric can consist of (e.g., whether a small
decorative silk piece on a cotton caftan is permissible or not) for it to be
lawful for men to wear, but the dominant opinion of most Muslim scholars is
that the wearing of silk by men is forbidden. Modern attire has raised a number
of issues, including, for instance, the permissibility of wearing silk
neckties, which are masculine articles of clothing.
Despite injunctions against silk for men, silk has retained its popularity in
the Islamic_world because of its permissibility for women, and due to the
presence of non-Muslim communities. The Muslim Moors brought silk with them to
Spain during their conquest of the Iberian_Peninsula.
**** Medieval and modern Europe ****
Silk satin leaf, wood sticks and guards, c. 1890
Italy was the most important producer of silk during the Medieval age. The
first center to introduce silk production to Italy was the city of Catanzaro
during the 11th century in the region of Calabria. The silk of Catanzaro
supplied almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair in the port
of Reggio_Calabria, to Spanish, Venetian, Genovese and Dutch merchants.
Catanzaro became the lace capital of the world with a large silkworm breeding
facility that produced all the laces and linens used in the Vatican. The city
was world-famous for its fine fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and
brocades.[31]
Another notable center was the Italian city-state of Lucca which largely
financed itself through silk-production and silk-trading, beginning in the 12th
century. Other Italian cities involved in silk production were Genoa, Venice
and Florence.
The Silk_Exchange_in_Valencia from the 15th centuryâwhere previously in 1348
also perxal (percale) was traded as some kind of silkâillustrates the power
and wealth of one of the great Mediterranean mercantile cities.[32][33]
Silk was produced in and exported from the province of Granada, Spain,
especially the Alpujarras region, until the Moriscos, whose industry it was,
were expelled from Granada in 1571.[34][35]
Since the 15th century, silk production in France has been centered around the
city of Lyon where many mechanic tools for mass production were first
introduced in the 17th century.

James_I attempted to establish silk production in England, purchasing and
planting 100,000 mulberry trees, some on land adjacent to Hampton_Court_Palace,
but they were of a species unsuited to the silk worms, and the attempt failed.
In 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a silk throwing enterprise at Logwood_mill_in
Stockport; in 1744, Burton Mill was erected in Macclesfield; and in 1753 Old
Mill was built in Congleton.[36] These three towns remained the centre of the
English silk throwing industry until silk throwing was replaced by silk_waste
spinning. British enterprise also established silk filature in Cyprus in 1928.
In England in the mid-20th century, raw silk was produced at Lullingstone
Castle in Kent. Silkworms were raised and reeled under the direction of Zoe
Lady Hart Dyke, later moving to Ayot_St_Lawrence in Hertfordshire in 1956.[37]

**** North America ****
Wild silk taken from the nests of native caterpillars was used by the Aztecs to
make containers and as paper.[41][42] Silkworms were introduced to Oaxaca from
Spain in the 1530s and the region profited from silk production until the early
17th century, when the king of Spain banned export to protect Spain's silk
industry. Silk production for local consumption has continued until the present
day, sometimes spinning wild silk.[43]
King James_I introduced silk-growing to the British colonies in America around
1619, ostensibly to discourage tobacco planting. The Shakers in Kentucky
adopted the practice.

such textiles in the world in the early 20th century[44]
The history of industrial silk in the United States is largely tied to several
smaller urban centers in the Northeast region. Beginning in the 1830s,
Manchester,_Connecticut emerged as the early center of the silk industry in
America, when the Cheney Brothers became the first in the United States to
properly raise silkworms on an industrial scale; today the Cheney_Brothers
Historic_District showcases their former mills.[45] With the mulberry_tree
craze of that decade, other smaller producers began raising silkworms. This
economy particularly gained traction in the vicinity of Northampton,
Massachusetts and its neighboring Williamsburg, where a number of small firms
and cooperatives emerged. Among the most prominent of these was the cooperative
utopian Northampton Association for Education and Industry, of which Sojourner
Truth was a member.[46] Following the destructive Mill_River_Flood_of_1874, one
manufacturer, William_Skinner, relocated his mill from Williamsburg to the
then-new city of Holyoke. Over the next 50 years he and his sons would maintain
relations between the American silk industry and its counterparts in Japan,[47]
and expanded their business to the point that by 1911, the Skinner Mill complex
contained the largest silk mill under one roof in the world, and the brand
Skinner Fabrics had become the largest manufacturer of silk satins
internationally.[44][48] Other efforts later in the 19th century would also
bring the new silk industry to Paterson,_New_Jersey, with several firms hiring
European-born textile workers and granting it the nickname "Silk City" as
another major center of production in the United States.
World_War_II interrupted the silk trade from Asia, and silk prices increased
dramatically.[49] U.S. industry began to look for substitutes, which led to the
use of synthetics such as nylon. Synthetic silks have also been made from
lyocell, a type of cellulose fiber, and are often difficult to distinguish from
real silk (see spider_silk for more on synthetic silks).
**** Malaysia ****
In Terengganu, which is now part of Malaysia, a second generation of silkworm
was being imported as early as 1764 for the country's silk textile industry,
especially songket.[50] However, since the 1980s, Malaysia is no longer engaged
in sericulture but does plant mulberry trees.
**** Vietnam ****
In Vietnamese legend, silk appeared in the first millennia AD and is still
being woven today.
***** Production process *****
The process of silk production is known as sericulture.[51] The entire
production process of silk can be divided into several steps which are
typically handled by different entities[clarification_needed]. Extracting raw
silk starts by cultivating the silkworms on mulberry leaves. Once the worms
start pupating in their cocoons, these are dissolved in boiling water in order
for individual long fibres to be extracted and fed into the spinning reel.[52]
To produce 1 kg of silk, 104 kg of mulberry leaves must be eaten by 3000
silkworms. It takes about 5000 silkworms to make a pure silk kimono.[53]:104
The major silk producers are China (54%) and India (14%).[54] Other statistics:

The environmental impact of silk production is potentially large when compared
with other natural fibers. A life cycle assessment of Indian silk production
shows that the production process has a large carbon and water footprint,
mainly due to the fact that it is an animal-derived fiber and more inputs such
as fertilizer and water are needed per unit of fiber produced.[56]

**** Physical properties ****
Silk fibers from the Bombyx mori silkworm have a triangular cross_section with
rounded corners, 5â10 Î¼m wide. The fibroin-heavy chain is composed mostly of
beta-sheets, due to a 59-mer amino acid repeat sequence with some variations.
[57] The flat surfaces of the fibrils reflect light at many angles, giving silk
a natural sheen. The cross-section from other silkworms can vary in shape and
diameter: crescent-like for Anaphe and elongated wedge for tussah. Silkworm
fibers are naturally extruded from two silkworm glands as a pair of primary
filaments (brin), which are stuck together, with sericin proteins that act like
glue, to form a bave. Bave diameters for tussah silk can reach 65 Î¼m. See
cited reference for cross-sectional SEM photographs.[58]
Raw silk of domesticated silk worms, showing its natural shine.
Silk has a smooth, soft texture that is not slippery, unlike many synthetic
fibers.
Silk is one of the strongest natural fibers, but it loses up to 20% of its
strength when wet. It has a good moisture_regain of 11%. Its elasticity is
moderate to poor: if elongated even a small amount, it remains stretched. It
can be weakened if exposed to too much sunlight. It may also be attacked by
insects, especially if left dirty.
One example of the durable nature of silk over other fabrics is demonstrated by
the recovery in 1840 of silk garments from a wreck_of_1782: 'The most durable
article found has been silk; for besides pieces of cloaks and lace, a pair of
black satin breeches, and a large satin waistcoat with flaps, were got up, of
which the silk was perfect, but the lining entirely gone ... from the thread
giving way ... No articles of dress of woollen cloth have yet been found.'[59]
Silk is a poor conductor of electricity and thus susceptible to static_cling.
Silk has a high emissivity for infrared light, making it feel cool to the
touch.[60]
Unwashed silk chiffon may shrink up to 8% due to a relaxation of the fiber
macrostructure, so silk should either be washed prior to garment construction,
or dry_cleaned. Dry cleaning may still shrink the chiffon up to 4%.
Occasionally, this shrinkage can be reversed by a gentle steaming with a press
cloth. There is almost no gradual shrinkage nor shrinkage due to molecular-
level deformation.
Natural and synthetic silk is known to manifest piezoelectric properties in
proteins, probably due to its molecular structure.[61]
Silkworm silk was used as the standard for the denier, a measurement of linear
density in fibers. Silkworm silk therefore has a linear density of
approximately 1 den, or 1.1 dtex.

Silk emitted by the silkworm consists of two main proteins, sericin and
fibroin, fibroin being the structural center of the silk, and serecin being the
sticky material surrounding it. Fibroin is made up of the amino_acids Gly-Ser-
Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala and forms beta_pleated_sheets. Hydrogen_bonds form between
chains, and side chains form above and below the plane of the hydrogen bond
network.
The high proportion (50%) of glycine allows tight packing. This is because
glycine's R group is only a hydrogen and so is not as sterically constrained.
The addition of alanine and serine makes the fibres strong and resistant to
breaking. This tensile strength is due to the many interceded hydrogen bonds,
and when stretched the force is applied to these numerous bonds and they do not
break.
Silk is resistant to most mineral_acids, except for sulfuric_acid, which
dissolves it. It is yellowed by perspiration. Chlorine bleach will also destroy
silk fabrics.
***** Variants *****
**** Regenerated silk fiber ****
RSF is produced by chemically dissolving silkworm cocoons, leaving their
molecular structure intact. The silk fibers dissolve into tiny thread-like
structures known as microfibrils. The resulting solution is extruded through a
small opening, causing the microfibrils to reassemble into a single fiber. The
resulting material is reportedly twice as stiff as silk.[63]
***** Applications *****

**** Clothing ****
Silk's absorbency makes it comfortable to wear in warm weather and while
active. Its low conductivity keeps warm air close to the skin during cold
weather. It is often used for clothing such as shirts, ties, blouses, formal
dresses, high fashion clothes, lining, lingerie, pajamas, robes, dress suits,
sun dresses and Eastern folk_costumes. For practical use, silk is excellent as
clothing that protects from many biting insects that would ordinarily pierce
clothing, such as mosquitoes and horseflies.
Fabrics that are often made from silk include charmeuse, habutai, chiffon,
taffeta, crepe_de_chine, dupioni, noil, tussah, and shantung, among others.
**** Furniture ****
Silk's attractive lustre and drape makes it suitable for many furnishing
applications. It is used for upholstery, wall coverings, window treatments (if
blended with another fiber), rugs, bedding and wall hangings.[citation_needed]
**** Industry ****
Silk had many industrial and commercial uses, such as in parachutes, bicycle
tires, comforter_filling and artillery gunpowder bags.[64]
**** Medicine ****
A special manufacturing process removes the outer sericin coating of the silk,
which makes it suitable as non-absorbable surgical_sutures. This process has
also recently led to the introduction of specialist silk underclothing, which
has been used for skin conditions including eczema.[65][66] New uses and
manufacturing techniques have been found for silk for making everything from
disposable cups to drug delivery systems and holograms.[67]
**** Biomaterial ****
Silk has been considered as a luxurious textile since 3630 BC. However, it
started to serve also as a biomedical material for suture in surgeries decades
ago. In the past 30 years, it has been widely studied and used as a
biomaterial, which refers to materials used for medical applications in
organisms, due to its excellent properties, including remarkable mechanical
properties, comparative biocompatibility, tunable degradation rates in vitro
and in vivo, the ease to load cellular growth factors (for example, BMP-2), and
the ability to be processed into several other formats such as films, gels,
particles, and scaffolds.[68] Silks from Bombyx mori, a kind of cultivated
silkworm, are the most widely investigated silks.[69]
Silks derived from Bombyx mori are generally made of two parts: the silk
fibroin fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa and a heavy chain of 350kDa
(or 390kDa[70]) linked by a single disulfide bond[71] and a glue-like protein,
sericin, comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight. Silk fibroin contains
hydrophobic beta_sheet blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the
beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers,
which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of poly(lactic_acid) and hundreds of
times that of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk
fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials. Indeed, silk fibers
have found their way into tendon tissue engineering,[72] where mechanical
properties matter greatly. In addition, mechanical properties of silks from
various kinds of silkworms vary widely, which provides more choices for their
use in tissue engineering.
Most products fabricated from regenerated silk are weak and brittle, with only
â1â2% of the mechanical strength of native silk fibers due to the absence
of appropriate secondary and hierarchical structure,

*** Biocompatibility ***
Biocompatibility, i.e., to what level the silk will cause an immune response,
is a critical issue for biomaterials. The issue arose during its increasing
clinical use. Wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid fraying and
potential immune responses[68] when silk fibers serve as suture materials.
Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as the
extent of the removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating
material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune
response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is
the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an
essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk.
However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to
inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based
biomaterials.[74] In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response
similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro[75][76] when assessed with
human mesenchymal stem_cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when
implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo.[76] Thus, appropriate
degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk fibroin,
which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs.[77] There
are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the
human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures
serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the
recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue
engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the
biocompatibility of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the
biocompatibility of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of
immune responses[78][79] and diseases[80] have been triggered by the degraded
products of silk fibroin.
*** Biodegradability ***
Biodegradability (also known as biodegradation)--the ability to be
disintegrated by biological approaches, including bacteria, fungi, and
cellsâis another significant property of biomaterials today. Biodegradable
materials can minimize the pain of patients from surgeries, especially in
tissue engineering, there is no need of surgery in order to remove the scaffold
implanted. Wang et al.[81] showed the in vivo degradation of silk via aqueous
3-D scaffolds implanted into Lewis rats. Enzymes are the means used to achieve
degradation of silk in vitro. Protease XIV from Streptomyces griseus and Î±-
chymotrypsin from bovine pancreases are the two popular enzymes for silk
degradation. In addition, gamma-radiation, as well as cell_metabolism, can also
regulate the degradation of silk.
Compared with synthetic biomaterials such as polyglycolides and polylactides,
silk is obviously advantageous in some aspects in biodegradation. The acidic
degraded products of polyglycolides and polylactides will decrease the pH of
the ambient environment and thus adversely influence the metabolism of cells,
which is not an issue for silk. In addition, silk materials can retain strength
over a desired period from weeks to months as needed by mediating the content
of beta sheets.
*** Genetic modification ***
Genetic_modification of domesticated silkworms has been used to alter the
composition of the silk.[82] As well as possibly facilitating the production of
more useful types of silk, this may allow other industrially or therapeutically
useful proteins to be made by silkworms.[83]
***** Cultivation *****
Thai man spools silk
Cocoon
Silk moths lay eggs on specially prepared paper. The eggs hatch and the
caterpillars (silkworms) are fed fresh mulberry leaves. After about 35 days and
4 moltings, the caterpillars are 10,000 times heavier than when hatched and are
ready to begin spinning a cocoon. A straw frame is placed over the tray of
caterpillars, and each caterpillar begins spinning a cocoon by moving its head
in a pattern. Two glands produce liquid silk and force it through openings in
the head called spinnerets. Liquid silk is coated in sericin, a water-soluble
protective gum, and solidifies on contact with the air. Within 2â3 days, the
caterpillar spins about 1 mile of filament and is completely encased in a
cocoon. The silk farmers then heat the cocoons to kill them, leaving some to
metamorphose into moths to breed the next generation of caterpillars. Harvested
cocoons are then soaked in boiling water to soften the sericin holding the silk
fibers together in a cocoon shape. The fibers are then unwound to produce a
continuous thread. Since a single thread is too fine and fragile for commercial
use, anywhere from three to ten strands are spun together to form a single
thread of silk.[84]
***** Animal rights *****
As the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the larvae by
boiling them, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights
activists.[85] Mohandas_Gandhi was critical of silk production based on the
Ahimsa philosophy, which led to the promotion of cotton and Ahimsa_silk, a type
of wild_silk made from the cocoons of wild and semi-wild silk moths.[86]
Since silk cultivation kills silkworms, possibly painfully,[87] People_for_the
Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals (PETA) urges people not to buy silk items.[88]
