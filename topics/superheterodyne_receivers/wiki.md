A superheterodyne receiver, often shortened to superhet, is a type of radio
receiver that uses frequency_mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed
intermediate_frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the
original carrier_frequency. It was invented by US engineer Edwin_Armstrong in
1918 during World_War_I.[1] Virtually all modern radio receivers use the
superheterodyne principle.

***** History[edit] *****
One of the prototype superheterodyne receivers built at Armstrong's Signal
Corps laboratory in Paris during World War I. It is constructed in two
sections, the mixer and local_oscillator (left) and three IF amplification
stages and a detector stage (right). The intermediate frequency was 75 kHz.
**** Background[edit] ****
"Superheterodyne" is a contraction of "supersonic heterodyne", where
"supersonic" indicates frequencies above the range of human hearing. The word
heterodyne is derived from the Greek roots hetero- "different", and -dyne
"power". In radio applications the term derives from the "heterodyne detector"
pioneered by Canadian inventor Reginald_Fessenden in 1905, describing his
proposed method of producing an audible signal from the Morse_code
transmissions of the new continuous_wave transmitters. With the older spark_gap
transmitters then in use, the Morse code signal consisted of short bursts of a
carrier_wave. Since these bursts were derived from the output of an alternator,
they modulated the carrier at a frequency within the audio range and thus could
be heard as a chirp or a buzz in the receiver's headphones. However, the signal
from a continuous wave transmitter is at a single frequency well above the
audio range, and Morse Code from one of these would be heard only as a series
of clicks or thumps. Fessenden's idea was to run two Alexanderson_alternators,
one producing a carrier frequency 3 kHz higher than the other. In the
receiver's detector, the two carriers would beat together to produce a 3 kHz
tone, thus in the headphones the Morse signals would then be heard as a series
of 3 kHz beeps. For this he coined the term "heterodyne," meaning "generated by
a difference" (in frequency).
**** Invention[edit] ****
The French engineer Lucien_LÃ©vy filed a patent application for the
superheterodyne principle in August 1917 with brevet nÂ° 493660.[2] The
American Edwin_Howard_Armstrong also filed a patent in 1917.[3][4][5] Levy
filed his original disclosure about seven months before Armstrong's.[6] The
German inventor Walter_H._Schottky also filed a patent in 1918.[2] At first the
US recognised Armstrong as the inventor, and his US Patent 1,342,885 was issued
on 8 June 1920.[6] After various changes and court hearings LÃ©vy was awarded a
US patent No 1,734,938 that included seven of the nine claims in Armstrong's
application, while the two remaining claims were granted to Alexanderson of GE
and Kendall of AT&T.[6]
One of the first amateur superheterodyne receivers, built in 1920 even before
Armstrong published his paper. Due to the low gain of early triodes it required
9 tubes, with 5 IF amplification stages, and used an IF of around 50 kHz.
Armstrong invented his receiver as a means of overcoming the deficiencies of
early vacuum tube triodes used as high-frequency amplifiers in radio direction
finding equipment. Unlike simple radio communication, which only needs to make
transmitted signals audible, direction-finders measure the received signal
strength, which necessitates linear amplification of the actual carrier wave.
In a triode radio-frequency (RF) amplifier, if both the plate (anode) and grid
are connected to resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency, stray
capacitive_coupling between the grid and the plate will cause the amplifier to
go into oscillation if the stage gain is much more than unity. In early
designs, dozens (in some cases over 100) low-gain triode stages had to be
connected in cascade to make workable equipment, which drew enormous amounts of
power in operation and required a team of maintenance engineers. The strategic
value was so high, however, that the British_Admiralty felt the high cost was
justified.
Armstrong realized that if radio direction-finding (RDF) receivers could be
operated at a higher frequency, this would allow better detection of enemy
shipping. However, at that time, no practical "short wave" (defined then as any
frequency above 500 kHz) amplifier existed, due to the limitations of existing
triodes.
It had been noticed that when a regenerative receiver went into oscillation,
other nearby receivers would suddenly start picking up stations on frequencies
different from the stations' transmission frequency. Armstrong (and others)
eventually deduced that this was caused by a "supersonic heterodyne" between
the station's carrier frequency and the regenerative receiver's oscillation
frequency. Thus if a station was transmitting on 300 kHz and the oscillating
receiver was set to 400 kHz, the station would be heard not only at the
original 300 kHz, but also at 100 kHz and 700 kHz.
Armstrong realized that this was a potential solution to the "short wave"
amplification problem, since the beat frequency still retained its original
modulation, but on a lower carrier frequency. To monitor a frequency of
1500 kHz for example, he could set up an oscillator at, for example, 1560 kHz,
which would produce a heterodyne difference frequency of 60 kHz, a frequency
that could then be more conveniently amplified by the triodes of the day. He
termed this the "intermediate_frequency" often abbreviated to "IF".
     In December 1919, Major E. H. Armstrong gave publicity to an indirect
     method of obtaining short-wave amplification, called the super-
     heterodyne. The idea is to reduce the incoming frequency, which may
     be, say 1,500,000 cycles (200 meters), to some suitable super-audible
     frequency that can be amplified efficiently, then passing this
     current through an intermediate frequency amplifier, and finally
     rectifying and carrying on to one or two stages of audio frequency
     amplification.[7]
**** Development[edit] ****
The first commercial superheterodyne receiver,[8] the RCA Radiola AR-812,
brought out March 4, 1924 priced at $286. It used 6 triodes: a mixer, local
oscillator, two IF and two audio amplifier stages, with an IF of 45 kHz. It was
a commercial success, with better performance than competing receivers.
Armstrong was able to put his ideas into practice, and the technique was soon
adopted by the military. However, it was less popular when commercial radio
broadcasting began in the 1920s, mostly due to the need for an extra tube (for
the oscillator), the generally higher cost of the receiver, and the level of
technical skill required to operate it. For early domestic radios, tuned_radio
frequency_receivers (TRF) were more popular because they were cheaper, easier
for a non-technical owner to use, and less costly to operate. Armstrong
eventually sold his superheterodyne patent to Westinghouse, who in turn sold it
to the Radio_Corporation_of_America_(RCA), the latter monopolizing the market
for superheterodyne receivers until 1930.[9]
Early superheterodyne receivers used IFs as low as 20 kHz, often based on the
self-resonance of iron-core transformers. This made them extremely susceptible
to image_frequency interference, but at the time, the main objective was
sensitivity rather than selectivity. Using this technique, a small number of
triodes could be made to do the work that formerly required dozens of triodes.
In the 1920s, commercial IF filters looked very similar to 1920s audio
interstage coupling transformers, had very similar construction and were wired
up in an almost identical manner, and so they were referred to as "IF
transformers". By the mid-1930s however, superheterodynes were using much
higher intermediate frequencies, (typically around 440â470 kHz), with tuned
coils similar in construction to the aerial and oscillator coils. However, the
name "IF transformer" was retained and is still used today. Modern receivers
typically use a mixture of ceramic_resonator or SAW (surface-acoustic wave)
resonators as well as traditional tuned-inductor IF transformers.
"All_American_Five" vacuum-tube superheterodyne AM broadcast receiver from
1940s was cheap to manufacture because it only required five tubes.
By the 1930s, improvements in vacuum tube technology rapidly eroded the TRF
receiver's cost advantages, and the explosion in the number of broadcasting
stations created a demand for cheaper, higher-performance receivers.
The development of the tetrode vacuum tube containing a screen_grid led to a
multi-element tube in which the mixer and oscillator functions could be
combined, first used in the so-called autodyne mixer. This was rapidly followed
by the introduction of tubes specifically designed for superheterodyne
operation, most notably the pentagrid_converter. By reducing the tube count,
this further reduced the advantage of preceding receiver designs.
By the mid-1930s, commercial production of TRF receivers was largely replaced
by superheterodyne receivers. By the 1940s the vacuum-tube superheterodyne AM
broadcast receiver was refined into a cheap-to-manufacture design called the
"All_American_Five", because it only uses five vacuum tubes: usually a
converter (mixer/local oscillator), an IF amplifier, a detector/audio amp,
audio power amp, and a rectifier. From this time, the superheterodyne design
was used for virtually all commercial radio and TV receivers.
***** Principle of operation[edit] *****
Block diagram of a typical superheterodyne receiver. Red parts are those that
handle the incoming radio frequency (RF) signal; green are parts that operate
at the intermediate frequency (IF), while blue parts operate at the modulation
(audio) frequency. The dotted line indicates that the local oscillator and RF
filter must be tuned in tandem.
How a superheterodyne radio works. The horizontal axes are frequency f. The
blue graphs show the voltages of the radio signals at various points in the
circuit. The red graphs show the transfer_functions of the filters in the
circuit; the thickness of the red bands shows the fraction of signal from the
previous graph that passes through the filter at each frequency. The incoming
radio signal from the antenna (top graph) consists of the desired radio signal
S1 plus others at different frequencies. The RF filter (2nd graph) removes any
signal such as S2 at the image_frequency LO - IF, which would otherwise pass
through the IF filter and interfere. The remaining composite signal is applied
to the mixer along with a local oscillator signal (LO) (3rd graph). In the
mixer the signal S1 combines with the LO frequency to create a heterodyne at
the difference between these frequencies, the intermediate frequency (IF), at
the mixer output (4th graph). This passes through the IF bandpass filter (5th
graph) is amplified and demodulated (demodulation is not shown). The unwanted
signals create heterodynes at other frequencies (4th graph), which are filtered
out by the IF filter .
The diagram at right shows the block diagram of a typical single-conversion
superheterodyne receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to
superheterodyne receivers.[10] The antenna collects the radio signal. The tuned
RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; it is
necessary to suppress the image_frequency (see below), and may also serve to
prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A
local_oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable
frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations.
The frequency_mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne
its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower,
fixed, intermediate_frequency (IF). The IF band-pass_filter and amplifier
supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. The
demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency;
the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.
**** Circuit description[edit] ****
To receive a radio signal, a suitable antenna is required. The output of the
antenna may be very small, often only a few microvolts. The signal from the
antenna is tuned and may be amplified in a so-called radio frequency (RF)
amplifier, although this stage is often omitted. One or more tuned_circuits at
this stage block frequencies that are far removed from the intended reception
frequency. In order to tune the receiver to a particular station, the frequency
of the local oscillator is controlled by the tuning knob (for instance). Tuning
of the local oscillator and the RF stage may use a variable_capacitor, or
varicap_diode.[11] The tuning of one (or more) tuned circuits in the RF stage
must track the tuning of the local oscillator.
**** Local oscillator and mixer[edit] ****
The signal is then fed into a circuit where it is mixed with a sine wave from a
variable frequency oscillator known as the local_oscillator (LO). The mixer
uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat_frequencies
signals,[12] each one containing the modulation contained in the desired
signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the
local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies
fRF + fLO and fRF − fLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional
frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally,
the IF bandpass_filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF
signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the
received radio signal had at fRF.
The frequency of the local oscillator fLO is set so the desired reception radio
frequency fRF mixes to fIF. There are two choices for the local oscillator
frequency because the dominant mixer products are at fRF Â± fLO. If the local
oscillator frequency is less than the desired reception frequency, it is called
low-side injection (fIF = fRF â fLO); if the local oscillator is higher, then
it is called high-side injection (fIF = fLO â fRF).
The mixer will process not only the desired input signal at fRF, but also all
signals present at its inputs. There will be many mixer products (heterodynes).
Most other signals produced by the mixer (such as due to stations at nearby
frequencies) can be filtered out in the IF amplifier; that gives the
superheterodyne receiver its superior performance. However, if fLO is set to
fRF + fIF, then an incoming radio signal at fLO + fIF will also produce a
heterodyne at fIF; the frequency fLO + fIF is called the image frequency and
must be rejected by the tuned circuits in the RF stage. The image frequency is
2 fIF higher (or lower) than the desired frequency fRF, so employing a higher
IF frequency fIF increases the receiver's image rejection without requiring
additional selectivity in the RF stage.[dubious  – discuss]
To suppress the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF stage and the LO may need
to "track" each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed
tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is
changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center
frequency. For example, a typical AM broadcast band receiver covers 510 kHz to
1655 kHz (a roughly 1160 kHz input band) with a 455 kHz IF frequency; an FM
broadcast band receiver covers 88 MHz to 108 MHz band with a 10.7 MHz IF
frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF
amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band
receiver LO were set at 1200 kHz, it would see stations at both 745 kHz
(1200−455 kHz) and 1655 kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so
that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly
attenuated. The tracking can be done with a multi-section variable capacitor or
some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An RF amplifier may have
tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned
circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track
closely but not perfectly.[13][14]
In many superheterodyne receivers the same stage is used as both the local
oscillator and the mixer, to save cost, power and size. This is called a
converter. In vacuum_tube receivers, a single pentagrid_converter tube would
oscillate and also provide signal amplification as well as frequency shifting.
[15]
**** IF amplifier[edit] ****
The stages of an intermediate frequency amplifier ("IF amplifier" or "IF
strip") are tuned to a fixed frequency that does not change as the receiving
frequency changes. The fixed frequency simplifies optimization of the IF
amplifier.[10] The IF amplifier is selective around its center frequency fIF.
The fixed center frequency allows the stages of the IF amplifier to be
carefully tuned for best performance (this tuning is called "aligning" the IF
amplifier). If the center frequency changed with the receiving frequency, then
the IF stages would have had to track their tuning. That is not the case with
the superheterodyne.
Typically, the IF center frequency fIF is chosen to be less than the desired
reception frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it
is easier and less expensive to get high selectivity at a lower frequency. For
the same bandwidth, a tuned circuit at a lower frequency needs a lower Q.
Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher center frequency
will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth.
Second, it is easier and less expensive to get high gain at a lower frequency.
When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gainâbandwidth
product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gainâbandwidth
product of 100 MHz, then it would have a voltage gain of 100 at 1 MHz but only
10 at 10 MHz. If the IF amplifier needed a voltage gain of 10,000, then it
would need only two stages with an IF at 1 MHz but four stages at 10 MHz.
Usually the intermediate frequency is lower than the reception frequency fRF,
but in some modern receivers (e.g. scanners and spectrum analyzers) a higher IF
frequency is used to minimize problems with image rejection or gain the
benefits of fixed-tuned stages. The Rohde & Schwarz EK-070 VLF/HF receiver
covers 10 kHz to 30 MHz.[16] It has a band switched RF filter and mixes the
input to a first IF of 81.4 MHz. The first LO frequency is 81.4 to 111.4 MHz,
so the primary images are far away. The first IF stage uses a crystal filter
with a 12 kHz bandwidth. There is a second frequency conversion (making a
triple-conversion receiver) that mixes the 81.4 MHz first IF with 80 MHz to
create a 1.4 MHz second IF. Image rejection for the second IF is not a major
problem because the first IF provides adequate image rejection and the second
mixer is fixed tuned.
In order to avoid interference to receivers, licensing authorities will avoid
assigning common IF frequencies to transmitting stations. Standard intermediate
frequencies used are 455 kHz for medium-wave AM radio, 10.7 MHz for broadcast
FM receivers, 38.9 MHz (Europe) or 45 MHz (US) for television, and 70 MHz for
satellite and terrestrial microwave equipment. To avoid tooling_costs
associated with these components, most manufacturers then tended to design
their receivers around a fixed range of frequencies offered, which resulted in
a worldwide de facto standardization of intermediate frequencies.
In early superhets, the IF stage was often a regenerative stage providing the
sensitivity and selectivity with fewer components. Such superhets were called
super-gainers or regenerodynes.[17] Another circuit added to the intermediate
frequency chain is the Q_multiplier.
**** IF bandpass filter[edit] ****
The IF stage includes a filter and/or multiple tuned circuits in order to
achieve the desired selectivity. This filtering must therefore have a band pass
equal to or less than the frequency spacing between adjacent broadcast
channels. Ideally a filter would have a high attenuation to adjacent channels,
but maintain a flat response across the desired signal spectrum in order to
retain the quality of the received signal. This may be obtained using one or
more dual tuned IF transformers, a quartz crystal_filter, or a multipole
ceramic_crystal_filter.[18]
In the case of television receivers, no other technique was able to produce the
precise bandpass characteristic needed for vestigial_sideband reception, such
as that used in the NTSC system first approved by the U.S. in 1941. By the
1980s, multi-component capacitor-inductor filters had been replaced with
precision electromechanical surface_acoustic_wave (SAW) filters. Fabricated by
precision laser milling techniques, SAW filters are cheaper to produce, can be
made to extremely close tolerances, and are very stable in operation.
**** Demodulator[edit] ****
The received signal is now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio
signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM
demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called
envelope_detection), and a simple RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the
intermediate frequency.[19] FM signals may be detected using a discriminator,
ratio_detector, or phase-locked_loop. Continuous_wave and single_sideband
signals require a product_detector using a so-called beat_frequency_oscillator,
and there are other techniques used for different types of modulation.[20] The
resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a
loudspeaker.
When so-called high-side injection has been used, where the local oscillator is
at a higher frequency than the received signal (as is common), then the
frequency spectrum of the original signal will be reversed. This must be taken
into account by the demodulator (and in the IF filtering) in the case of
certain types of modulation such as single_sideband.
***** Multiple conversion[edit] *****
Double conversion superheterodyne receiver block diagram
To overcome obstacles such as image_response, some receivers use multiple
successive stages of frequency conversion and multiple IFs of different values.
A receiver with two frequency conversions and IFs is called a dual conversion
superheterodyne, and one with three IFs is called a triple conversion
superheterodyne.
The main reason that this is done is that with a single IF there is a tradeoff
between low image_response and selectivity. The separation between the received
frequency and the image_frequency is equal to twice the IF frequency, so the
higher the IF, the easier it is to design an RF filter to remove the image
frequency from the input and achieve low image_response. However, the higher
the IF, the more difficult it is to achieve high selectivity in the IF filter.
At shortwave frequencies and above, the difficulty in obtaining sufficient
selectivity in the tuning with the high IFs needed for low image response
impacts performance. To solve this problem two IF frequencies can be used,
first converting the input frequency to a high IF to achieve low image
response, and then converting this frequency to a low IF to achieve good
selectivity in the second IF filter. To improve tuning, a third IF can be used.
For example, for a receiver that can tune from 500 kHz to 30 MHz, three
frequency converters might be used.[10] With a 455 kHz IF it is easy to get
adequate front end selectivity with broadcast band (under 1600 kHz) signals.
For example, if the station being received is on 600 kHz, the local oscillator
will be set to 600 + 455 = 1055 kHz. But a station on 1510 kHz could also
potentially produce an IF of 455 kHz and so cause image interference. However,
because 600 kHz and 1510 kHz are so far apart, it is easy to design the front
end tuning to reject the 1510 kHz frequency.
However at 30 MHz, things are different. The oscillator would be set to
30.455 MHz to produce a 455 kHz IF, but a station on 30.910 would also produce
a 455 kHz beat, so both stations would be heard at the same time. But it is
virtually impossible to design an RF tuned circuit that can adequately
discriminate between 30 MHz and 30.91 MHz, so one approach is to "bulk
downconvert" whole sections of the shortwave bands to a lower frequency, where
adequate front-end tuning is easier to arrange.
For example, the ranges 29 MHz to 30 MHz; 28 MHz to 29 MHz etc. might be
converted down to 2 MHz to 3 MHz, there they can be tuned more conveniently.
This is often done by first converting each "block" up to a higher frequency
(typically 40 MHz) and then using a second mixer to convert it down to the
2 MHz to 3 MHz range. The 2 MHz to 3 MHz "IF" is basically another self-
contained superheterodyne receiver, most likely with a standard IF of 455 kHz.

***** Modern designs[edit] *****
Microprocessor technology allows replacing the superheterodyne receiver design
by a software_defined_radio architecture, where the IF processing after the
initial IF filter is implemented in software. This technique is already in use
in certain designs, such as very low-cost FM radios incorporated into mobile
phones, since the system already has the necessary microprocessor.
Radio_transmitters may also use a mixer stage to produce an output frequency,
working more or less as the reverse of a superheterodyne receiver.
***** Advantages and disadvantages[edit] *****
Superheterodyne receivers have essentially replaced all previous receiver
designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated the
advantages of designs (such as the regenerative_receiver) that used fewer
vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity,
frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned_radio_frequency
receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable
oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a
lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q_factor
than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows the use of a crystal
filter[10] or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and
super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from
stability problems making them difficult to operate.
Although the advantages of the superhet design are overwhelming, there are a
few drawbacks that need to be tackled in practice.
**** Image frequency (fIMAGE)[edit] ****
Graphs illustrating the problem of image response in a superheterodyne. The
horizontal axes are frequency and the vertical axes are voltage. Without an
adequate RF filter, any signal S2 (green) at the image frequency      f  IMAGE
{\displaystyle f_{\text{IMAGE}}}  [{\displaystyle f_{\text{IMAGE}}}] is also
heterodyned to the IF frequency      f  IF     {\displaystyle f_{\text{IF}}}  [
{\displaystyle f_{\text{IF}}}] along with the desired radio signal S1 (blue) at
f  RF     {\displaystyle f_{\text{RF}}}  [{\displaystyle f_{\text{RF}}}], so
they both pass through the IF filter (red). Thus S2 interferes with S1.
One major disadvantage to the superheterodyne receiver is the problem of image
frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an undesired input
frequency equal to the station frequency plus (or minus) twice the intermediate
frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the
same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by
sufficient attenuation on the incoming signal by the RF amplifier filter of the
superheterodyne receiver.

      {\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {IMAGE} }={\begin{cases}f+2f_{\mathrm {IF} },&
      {\text{if }}f_{\mathrm {LO} }>f{\text{ (high side injection)}}\\f-2f_
      {\mathrm {IF} },&{\text{if }}f_{\mathrm {LO} }<f{\text{ (low side
      injection)}}\end{cases}}}  [{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {IMAGE} }={\begin
      {cases}f+2f_{\mathrm {IF} },&{\text{if }}f_{\mathrm {LO} }>f{\text{
      (high side injection)}}\\f-2f_{\mathrm {IF} },&{\text{if }}f_{\mathrm
      {LO} }<f{\text{  (low side injection)}}\end{cases}}}]
For example, an AM broadcast station at 580 kHz is tuned on a receiver with a
455 kHz IF. The local oscillator is tuned to 580 + 455 = 1035 kHz. But a signal
at 580 + 455 + 455 = 1490 kHz is also 455 kHz away from the local oscillator;
so both the desired signal and the image, when mixed with the local oscillator,
will also appear at the intermediate frequency. This image frequency is within
the AM broadcast band. Practical receivers have a tuning stage before the
converter, to greatly reduce the amplitude of image frequency signals;
additionally, broadcasting stations in the same area have their frequencies
assigned to avoid such images.
The unwanted frequency is called the image of the wanted frequency, because it
is the "mirror image" of the desired frequency reflected      f  o
{\displaystyle f_{o}\!}  [f_{o}\!]. A receiver with inadequate filtering at its
input will pick up signals at two different frequencies simultaneously: the
desired frequency and the image frequency. Any noise or random radio station at
the image frequency can interfere with reception of the desired signal.
Early Autodyne receivers typically used IFs of only 150 kHz or so, as it was
difficult to maintain reliable oscillation if higher frequencies were used. As
a consequence, most Autodyne receivers needed quite elaborate antenna tuning
networks, often involving double-tuned coils, to avoid image interference.
Later superhets used tubes specially designed for oscillator/mixer use, which
were able to work reliably with much higher IFs, reducing the problem of image
interference and so allowing simpler and cheaper aerial tuning circuitry.
Sensitivity to the image frequency can be minimized only by (1) a filter that
precedes the mixer or (2) a more complex mixer circuit [21] that suppresses the
image. In most receivers, this is accomplished by a bandpass_filter in the RF
front_end. In many tunable receivers, the bandpass filter is tuned in tandem
with the local oscillator.
Image rejection is an important factor in choosing the intermediate frequency
of a receiver. The farther apart the bandpass frequency and the image frequency
are, the more the bandpass filter will attenuate any interfering image signal.
Since the frequency separation between the bandpass and the image frequency is
2  f   I F       {\displaystyle 2f_{\mathrm {IF} }\!}  [2f_\mathrm{IF}\!], a
higher intermediate frequency improves image rejection. It may be possible to
use a high enough first IF that a fixed-tuned RF stage can reject any image
signals.
The ability of a receiver to reject interfering signals at the image frequency
is measured by the image_rejection_ratio. This is the ratio (in decibels) of
the output of the receiver from a signal at the received frequency, to its
output for an equal-strength signal at the image frequency.
**** Local oscillator radiation[edit] ****
Further information: Electromagnetic_compatibility
It is difficult to keep stray radiation from the local oscillator below the
level that a nearby receiver can detect. The receiver's local oscillator can
act like a low-power CW transmitter. Consequently, there can be mutual
interference in the operation of two or more superheterodyne receivers in close
proximity.
In intelligence operations, local oscillator radiation gives a means to detect
a covert receiver and its operating frequency. The method was used by MI-
5 during Operation_RAFTER.[22] This same technique is also used in radar
detector_detectors used by traffic police in jurisdictions where radar
detectors are illegal.
A method of significantly reducing the local oscillator radiation from the
receiver's antenna is to use an RF amplifier between the receiver's antenna and
its mixer stage.
**** Local oscillator sideband noise[edit] ****
Local oscillators typically generate a single frequency signal that has
negligible amplitude_modulation but some random phase_modulation. Either of
these impurities spreads some of the signal's energy into sideband frequencies.
That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response,
which would defeat the aim to make a very narrow bandwidth receiver such as to
receive low-rate digital signals. Care needs to be taken to minimize oscillator
phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear
mode.
***** Terminology[edit] *****
  First detector, second detector
      The mixer tube or transistor is sometimes called the first detector,
      while the demodulator that extracts the modulation from the IF signal is
      called the second detector. In a dual-conversion superhet there are two
      mixers, so the demodulator is called the third detector.
  RF_front_end
      Refers to all the components of the receiver up to and including the
      mixer; all the parts that process the signal at the original incoming
      radio frequency. In the block diagram above the RF front end components
      are colored red.
