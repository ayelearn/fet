Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, and sometimes other elements. Because of
its high tensile_strength and low cost, it is a major component used in
buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and
weapons.
Iron is the base_metal of steel. Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms
(allotropic forms), body_centered_cubic_and_face_centered_cubic, depending on
its temperature. In the body-centered cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom
in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell; in the
face-centered cubic, there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces
of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices. It is the interaction
of the allotropes_of_iron with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that
gives steel and cast_iron their range of unique properties.
In pure iron, the crystal_structure has relatively little resistance to the
iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile, or
soft and easily formed. In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and
inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of
dislocations.
The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight.
Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as
controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as
solute elements, or as precipitated phases), slows the movement of those
dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its
qualities. These qualities include the hardness, quenching_behavior, need for
annealing, tempering_behavior, yield_strength, and tensile_strength of the
resulting steel. The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is
possible only by reducing iron's ductility.
Steel was produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-
scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were
devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the blast_furnace and
production of crucible_steel. This was followed by the open-hearth_furnace and
then the Bessemer_process in England in the mid-19th century. With the
invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of mass-produced steel began. Mild
steel replaced wrought_iron.
Further refinements in the process, such as basic_oxygen_steelmaking (BOS),
largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and
increasing the quality of the final product. Today, steel is one of the most
common manmade materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced
annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by
assorted standards_organizations.

***** Definitions and related materials[edit] *****
The noun steel originates from the Proto-Germanic adjective stahlijÄ or
stakhlijan (made of steel), which is related to stahlaz or stahlijÄ (standing
firm).[1]
The carbon content of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain
ironâcarbon alloys.[2] These values vary depending on alloying_elements such
as manganese, chromium, nickel, tungsten, and so on. In contrast, cast_iron
does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron
quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents higher than those of steel make
a brittle alloy commonly called pig_iron. While iron alloyed with carbon is
called carbon steel, alloy_steel is steel to which other alloying elements have
been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common
alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron,
titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium.[3] Additional elements, most
frequently considered undesirable, are also important in steel: phosphorus,
sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper.
Plain carbon-iron alloys with a higher than 2.1% carbon content are known as
cast_iron. With modern steelmaking techniques such as powder metal forming, it
is possible to make very high-carbon (and other alloy material) steels, but
such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be
formed by casting as it has a lower melting_point than steel and good
castability properties.[3] Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining
the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make
malleable_iron or ductile_iron objects. Steel is distinguishable from wrought
iron (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon but
large amounts of slag.
***** Material properties[edit] *****
Iron-carbon equilibrium phase_diagram, showing the conditions necessary to form
different phases
Iron is commonly found in the Earth's crust in the form of an ore, usually an
iron oxide, such as magnetite or hematite. Iron is extracted from iron_ore by
removing the oxygen through its combination with a preferred chemical partner
such as carbon which is then lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This
process, known as smelting, was first applied to metals with lower melting
points, such as tin, which melts at about 250 Â°C (482 Â°F), and copper, which
melts at about 1,100 Â°C (2,010 Â°F), and the combination, bronze, which has a
melting point lower than 1,083 Â°C (1,981 Â°F). In comparison, cast iron melts
at about 1,375 Â°C (2,507 Â°F).[4] Small quantities of iron were smelted in
ancient times, in the solid state, by heating the ore in a charcoal fire and
then welding the clumps together with a hammer and in the process squeezing out
the impurities. With care, the carbon content could be controlled by moving it
around in the fire. Unlike copper and tin, liquid or solid iron dissolves
carbon quite readily.
All of these temperatures could be reached with ancient methods used since the
Bronze_Age. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond 800 Â°C
(1,470 Â°F), it is important that smelting take place in a low-oxygen
environment. Smelting, using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy
(pig_iron) that retains too much carbon to be called steel.[4] The excess
carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.
Other materials are often added to the iron/carbon mixture to produce steel
with desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile
strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable,
chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also
increases hardness while making it less prone to metal_fatigue.[5]
To inhibit corrosion, at least 11% chromium is added to steel so that a hard
oxide forms on the metal surface; this is known as stainless_steel. Tungsten
slows the formation of cementite, keeping carbon in the iron matrix and
allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in
high_speed_steel. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus are
considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the
steel melt during processing.[5]
The density of steel varies based on the alloying constituents but usually
ranges between 7,750 and 8,050 kg/m3 (484 and 503 lb/cu ft), or 7.75 and
8.05 g/cm3 (4.48 and 4.65 oz/cu in).[6]
Even in a narrow range of concentrations of mixtures of carbon and iron that
make a steel, a number of different metallurgical structures, with very
different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to
making quality steel. At room_temperature, the most stable form of pure iron is
the body-centered_cubic (BCC) structure called alpha iron or Î±-iron. It is a
fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no
more than 0.005% at 0 Â°C (32 Â°F) and 0.021 wt% at 723 Â°C (1,333 Â°F). The
inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called ferrite. At 910 Â°C, pure iron
transforms into a face-centered_cubic (FCC) structure, called gamma iron or Î³-
iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite. The more open
FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as
2.1%[7] (38 times that of ferrite) carbon at 1,148 Â°C (2,098 Â°F), which
reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron.[8] When
carbon moves out of solution with iron, it forms a very hard, but brittle
material called cementite (Fe3C).
When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a eutectoid steel), are cooled,
the austenitic phase (FCC) of the mixture attempts to revert to the ferrite
phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure,
resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is
for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a
surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with a small percentage of carbon
in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously
producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to
mother_of_pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon),
the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the
austenite grain boundaries until the percentage of carbon in the grains has
decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the
pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon
(hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining
composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will
form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in
hypoeuctoid steel.[9] The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow,
allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.
As the rate of cooling is increased the carbon will have less time to migrate
to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large
amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the
carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within
those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling
rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked
within the face-centered austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly
strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is
exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic
phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC
crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered_tetragonal
(BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation_energy for the transformation
from austenite to martensite.[clarification_needed] Moreover, there is no
compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.[10]
Martensite has a lower density (it expands during the cooling) than does
austenite, so that the transformation between them results in a change of
volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion
generally take the form of compression on the crystals of martensite and
tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both
constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause
a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work
hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks
to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.
[11]
**** Heat treatment[edit] ****
Main article: Heat_treating_carbon_steel
There are many types of heat_treating processes available to steel. The most
common are annealing, quenching, and tempering. Heat treatment is effective on
compositions above the eutectoid composition (hypereutectoid) of 0.8% carbon.
Hypoeutectoid steel does not benefit from heat treatment.
Annealing is the process of heating the steel to a sufficiently high
temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general
softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked
up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery,
recrystallization, and grain_growth. The temperature required to anneal a
particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the
alloying constituents.[12]
Quenching involves heating the steel to create the austenite phase then
quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle
martensitic structure.[10] The steel is then tempered, which is just a
specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the
annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite,
or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The
result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.[13]
***** Steel production[edit] *****
Main article: Steelmaking
See also: List_of_countries_by_steel_production
Iron_ore pellets for the production of steel
When iron is smelted from its ore, it contains more carbon than is desirable.
To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct
amount, at which point other elements can be added. In the past, steel
facilities would cast the raw steel product into ingots which would be stored
until use in further refinement processes that resulted in the finished
product. In modern facilities, the initial product is close to the final
composition and is continuously_cast into long slabs, cut and shaped into bars
and extrusions and heat treated to produce a final product. Today only a small
fraction is cast into ingots. Approximately 96% of steel is continuously cast,
while only 4% is produced as ingots.[14]
The ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and hot_rolled into slabs, billets,
or blooms. Slabs are hot or cold_rolled into sheet_metal or plates. Billets are
hot or cold rolled into bars, rods, and wire. Blooms are hot or cold rolled
into structural_steel, such as I-beams and rails. In modern steel mills these
processes often occur in one assembly_line, with ore coming in and finished
steel products coming out.[15] Sometimes after a steel's final rolling, it is
heat treated for strength; however, this is relatively rare.[16]

Bloomery smelting during the Middle_Ages
**** Ancient steel[edit] ****
Steel was known in antiquity and was produced in bloomeries and crucibles.[17]
[18]
The earliest known production of steel is seen in pieces of ironware excavated
from an archaeological_site in Anatolia (Kaman-KalehÃ¶yÃ¼k) and are nearly
4,000 years old, dating from 1800 BC.[19][20] Horace identifies steel weapons
such as the falcata in the Iberian_Peninsula, while Noric_steel was used by the
Roman_military.[21]
The reputation of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) grew considerably in
the rest of the world.[18] Metal production sites in Sri_Lanka employed wind
furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel.
Large-scale Wootz_steel production in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon
sources such as the plant AvÄram occurred by the sixth century BC, the
pioneering precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy.[17][18]
The Chinese of the Warring_States_period (403â221 BC) had quench-hardened
steel,[22] while Chinese of the Han_dynasty (202 BC â 220 AD) created steel
by melting together wrought iron with cast iron, gaining an ultimate product of
a carbon-intermediate steel by the 1st century AD.[23][24]
**** Wootz steel and Damascus steel[edit] ****
Main articles: Wootz_steel and Damascus_steel
Evidence of the earliest production of high carbon steel in India are found in
Kodumanal in Tamil_Nadu, the Golconda area in Andhra_Pradesh and Karnataka, and
in the Samanalawewa areas of Sri_Lanka.[25] This came to be known as Wootz
steel, produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally.
[26][27] The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are
mentioned in literature of Sangam_Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest steel
in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that
time â what they called Seric Iron.[28] A 200_BC_Tamil_trade_guild_in
Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the
oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the
classical_period.[29][30][31] The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka
had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera
Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD.[32][33] In Sri Lanka, this
early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon
winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel.[34][35] Since the technology was
acquired from the Tamilians from South India,[citation_needed] the origin of
steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400â500 BC.[26]
[35]
The manufacture of what came to be called Wootz, or Damascus_steel, famous for
its durability and ability to hold an edge, may have been taken by the Arabs
from Persia, who took it from India. It was originally created from a number of
different materials including various trace_elements, apparently ultimately
from the writings of Zosimos_of_Panopolis. In 327 BC, Alexander_the_Great was
rewarded by the defeated King Porus, not with gold or silver but with 30 pounds
of steel.[36] Recent studies have suggested that carbon_nanotubes were included
in its structure, which might explain some of its legendary qualities, though
given the technology of that time, such qualities were produced by chance
rather than by design.[37] Natural wind was used where the soil containing iron
was heated by the use of wood. The ancient_Sinhalese managed to extract a ton
of steel for every 2 tons of soil,[34] a remarkable feat at the time. One such
furnace was found in Samanalawewa and archaeologists were able to produce steel
as the ancients did.[34][38]
Crucible_steel, formed by slowly heating and cooling pure iron and carbon
(typically in the form of charcoal) in a crucible, was produced in Merv by the
9th to 10th century AD.[27] In the 11th century, there is evidence of the
production of steel in Song_China using two techniques: a "berganesque" method
that produced inferior, inhomogeneous steel, and a precursor to the modern
Bessemer_process that used partial decarbonization via repeated forging under a
cold_blast.[39]
**** Modern steelmaking[edit] ****
A Bessemer converter in Sheffield, England
Since the 17th century, the first step in European steel production has been
the smelting of iron ore into pig_iron in a blast_furnace.[40] Originally
employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more economical.
[41][42][43]
*** Processes starting from bar iron[edit] ***
Main articles: Blister_steel and Crucible_steel
In these processes pig iron was refined (fined) in a finery_forge to produce
bar_iron, which was then used in steel-making.[40]
The production of steel by the cementation_process was described in a treatise
published in Prague in 1574 and was in use in Nuremberg from 1601. A similar
process for case_hardening armor and files was described in a book published in
Naples in 1589. The process was introduced to England in about 1614 and used to
produce such steel by Sir Basil_Brooke at Coalbrookdale during the 1610s.[44]
The raw material for this process were bars of iron. During the 17th century it
was realized that the best steel came from oregrounds_iron of a region north of
Stockholm, Sweden. This was still the usual raw material source in the 19th
century, almost as long as the process was used.[45][46]
Crucible steel is steel that has been melted in a crucible rather than having
been forged, with the result that it is more homogeneous. Most previous
furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early
modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin_Huntsman
in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a
furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.[46][47]
*** Processes starting from pig iron[edit] ***

The modern era in steelmaking began with the introduction of Henry_Bessemer's
Bessemer_process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron.[48] His
method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild_steel came
to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used.[49] The
Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the
Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove
phosphorus.
Another 19th-century steelmaking process was the Siemens-Martin_process, which
complemented the Bessemer process.[46] It consisted of co-melting bar iron (or
steel scrap) with pig iron.
These methods of steel production were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz
process of basic_oxygen_steelmaking (BOS), developed in the 1950s, and other
oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous
steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited
impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used.
[50] Today, electric_arc_furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing
scrap_metal to create new steel. They can also be used for converting pig iron
to steel, but they use a lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per metric
ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply
of cheap electricity.[51]

Steel production (in million tons) by country in 2007
The steel industry is often considered an indicator of economic progress,
because of the critical role played by steel in infrastructural and overall
economic_development.[52] In 1980, there were more than 500,000 U.S.
steelworkers. By 2000, the number of steelworkers fell to 224,000.[53]
The economic_boom in China and India caused a massive increase in the demand
for steel. Between 2000 and 2005, world steel demand increased by 6%. Since
2000, several Indian[54] and Chinese steel firms have risen to prominence,
[according_to_whom?] such as Tata_Steel (which bought Corus_Group in 2007),
Baosteel_Group and Shagang_Group. As of 2017, though, ArcelorMittal is the
world's largest_steel_producer.[55] In 2005, the British_Geological_Survey
stated China was the top steel producer with about one-third of the world
share; Japan, Russia, and the US followed respectively.[56]
In 2008, steel began trading_as_a_commodity on the London_Metal_Exchange. At
the end of 2008, the steel industry faced a sharp downturn that led to many
cut-backs.[57]
***** Recycling[edit] *****
Main article: Ferrous_metal_recycling
Steel is one of the world's most-recycled materials, with a recycling rate of
over 60% globally;[58] in the United States alone, over 82,000,000 metric tons
(81,000,000 long tons; 90,000,000 short tons) were recycled in the year 2008,
for an overall recycling rate of 83%.[59]
As more steel is produced than is scrapped, the amount of recycled raw
materials is about 40% of the total of steel produced - in 2016, 1,628,000,000
tonnes (1.602Ã109 long tons; 1.795Ã109 short tons) of crude steel was
produced globally, with 630,000,000 tonnes (620,000,000 long tons; 690,000,000
short tons) recycled.[60]
***** Contemporary steel[edit] *****

world's largest manufacturers of steel before its closure in 2003

**** Carbon steels[edit] ****
Modern steels are made with varying combinations of alloy metals to fulfill
many purposes.[5] Carbon_steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts
for 90% of steel production.[3] Low_alloy_steel is alloyed with other elements,
usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by
weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections.[3] High_strength_low
alloy_steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements,
typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price
increase.[61]
Recent Corporate_Average_Fuel_Economy (CAFE) regulations have given rise to a
new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This
material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain
their current safety levels while using less material. There are several
commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase_steel, which is heat
treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a
formable, high strength steel.[62] Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP)
steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of
austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic
steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase_transition to
martensite without the addition of heat.[63] Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP)
steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work
hardening on the alloy.[64]
Carbon Steels are often galvanized, through hot-dip or electroplating in zinc
for protection against rust.[65]
**** Alloy steels[edit] ****
Stainless steels contain a minimum of 11% chromium, often combined with nickel,
to resist corrosion. Some stainless steels, such as the ferritic stainless
steels are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are nonmagnetic.[66]
Corrosion-resistant steels are abbreviated as CRES.
Some more modern steels include tool_steels, which are alloyed with large
amounts of tungsten and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution
hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation_hardening and improves the
alloy's temperature resistance.[3] Tool steel is generally used in axes,
drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other
special-purpose alloys include weathering_steels such as Cor-ten, which weather
by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted.[67]
Maraging_steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel
contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable
steel.[68]
Eglin_steel uses a combination of over a dozen different elements in varying
amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker_buster weapons.
Hadfield steel (after Sir Robert_Hadfield) or manganese steel contains 12â14%
manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin
which resists wearing. Examples include tank_tracks, bulldozer_blade edges and
cutting blades on the jaws_of_life.[69]
**** Standards[edit] ****
Most of the more commonly used steel alloys are categorized into various grades
by standards organizations. For example, the Society_of_Automotive_Engineers
has a series of grades defining many types of steel.[70] The American_Society
for_Testing_and_Materials has a separate set of standards, which define alloys
such as A36_steel, the most commonly used structural steel in the United
States.[71] The JIS also define series of steel grades that are being used
extensively in Japan as well as in developing countries.
***** Uses[edit] *****
A roll of steel wool
Iron and steel are used widely in the construction of roads, railways, other
infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such
as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel
skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In
addition, it sees widespread use in major_appliances and cars. Despite growth
in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is
used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and
screws and other household products and cooking utensils.[72]
Other common applications include shipbuilding, pipelines, mining, offshore
construction, aerospace, white_goods (e.g. washing_machines), heavy_equipment
such as bulldozers, office furniture, steel_wool, tools, and armour in the form
of personal vests or vehicle_armour (better known as rolled_homogeneous_armour
in this role).
**** Historical[edit] ****
A carbon steel knife
Before the introduction of the Bessemer_process and other modern production
techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative
existed, particularly for the cutting edge of knives, razors, swords, and other
items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs,
including those used in clocks_and_watches.[46]
With the advent of speedier and thriftier production methods, steel has become
easier to obtain and much cheaper. It has replaced wrought iron for a multitude
of purposes. However, the availability of plastics in the latter part of the
20th century allowed these materials to replace steel in some applications due
to their lower fabrication cost and weight.[73] Carbon_fiber is replacing steel
in some cost insensitive applications such as sports equipment and high end
automobiles.

Steel manufactured after World War II became contaminated with radionuclides by
nuclear_weapons_testing. Low-background steel, steel manufactured prior to
1945, is used for certain radiation-sensitive applications such as Geiger
counters and radiation_shielding.
