Potato chips (often just chips), or crisps, are thin slices of potato that have
been deep_fried or baked until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack,
side_dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional
varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including
herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial_flavors, and
additives.
Potato chips are a predominant part of the snack_food and convenience food
market in Western countries. The global potato chip market generated total
revenue of US$16.49 billion in 2005. This accounted for 35.5% of the total
savory snacks market in that year ($46.1 billion).[1]

***** History[edit] *****
**** Origins[edit] ****
The earliest known recipe for something similar to today's potato chips is in
the English cook William_Kitchiner's book The_Cook's_Oracle, first published in
1817, which was a bestseller in the United Kingdom. The 1822 edition's version
of recipe 104 is called "Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings" and reads "peel
large potatoes... cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a
lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping".[2][3]
Early recipes for potato chips in the United States are found in Mary
Randolph's Virginia House-Wife (1824),[4] and in N.K.M. Lee's Cook's Own Book
(1832),[5] both of which explicitly cite Kitchiner.[6]
**** Saratoga Springs[edit] ****
However, a legend associates the creation of potato chips with Saratoga
Springs, New York, decades later.[7] By the late nineteenth century, a popular
version of the story attributed the dish to George_Crum, an American cook of
African_American and Native_American heritage[8][9] at Moon's_Lake_House, who
was trying to appease an unhappy customer on 24 August 1853.[10] The customer
kept sending his French-fried_potatoes back, complaining that they were too
thick,[11] too "soggy," and/or not salted well enough. Frustrated, Crum
personally sliced several potatoes extremely thin, fried the potato slices to a
crisp, and seasoned them with extra salt. To Crum's surprise, the customer
loved them.[12] They soon came to be called "Saratoga Chips,"[13] a name that
persisted into at least the mid-twentieth century. A version of this story
popularized in a 1973 national advertising campaign by St. Regis Paper Company,
which manufactured packaging for chips, said that Crum's customer was Cornelius
Vanderbilt.[8] Crum was already renowned as a chef at the time, and by 1860, he
owned his own lakeside restaurant, which he called Crum's House.[8]
***** Production[edit] *****
In the 20th century, potato chips spread beyond chef-cooked restaurant fare and
began to be mass-produced for home consumption. The Dayton, Ohio-based Mike-
sell's_Potato_Chip_Company, founded in 1910, identifies as the "oldest potato
chip company in the United States".[14][15][16] New England-based Tri-Sum
Potato Chips, founded in 1908 as the Leominster Potato Chip Company, in
Leominster, Massachusetts claim to be America's first potato chip manufacturer.
[17][18]
**** Flavored chips[edit] ****
An advertisement for Smith's Potato Crisps
In an idea originated by the Smiths_Potato_Crisps_Company Ltd, formed in 1920,
Frank Smith packaged a twist of salt with his chips in greaseproof paper bags,
which were sold around London.[19] The potato chip remained otherwise
unseasoned until an innovation by Joe "Spud" Murphy, the owner of the Irish
crisps company Tayto, who in the 1950s developed a technology to add seasoning
during manufacture. After some trial and error, Murphy and his employee Seamus
Burke produced the world's first seasoned chips: Cheese & Onion and Salt &
Vinegar.[20] Companies worldwide sought to buy the rights to Tayto's technique.
[21]
The first flavored chips in the United States, barbecue_flavor, were being
manufactured and sold by 1954.[22][23][24] In 1958, Herr's was the first
company to introduce barbecue-flavored potato chips in Pennsylvania.[25]
**** Potato chip bag[edit] ****
Chips sold in markets were usually sold in tins or scooped out of storefront
glass bins and delivered by horse and wagon. Early potato chip bags were wax
paper with the ends ironed or stapled together. At first, potato chips were
packaged in barrels or tins, which left chips at the bottom stale and crumbled.
In the 1920s, Laura_Scudder,[26][27][28] an entrepreneur in Monterey_Park,
California, started having her workers take home sheets of wax paper to iron
into the form of bags, which were filled with chips at her factory the next
day. This pioneering method reduced crumbling and kept the chips fresh and
crisp longer. This innovation, along with the invention of cellophane, allowed
potato chips to become a mass-market_product. Today, chips are packaged in
plastic bags, with nitrogen gas blown in prior to sealing to lengthen shelf
life, and provide protection against crushing.[29][30]
**** Kettle cooked[edit] ****
Kettle-cooked chips
Chips were long made in a batch_process, where the potato slices are rinsed
with cold water to release starch,[31] fried at a low temperature (300 Â°F
(150 Â°C)),[32] and continuously raked to prevent them from sticking together.
Industrial advances resulted in a shift to production by a continuous_process,
running chips through a vat of hot oil and drying them in a conveyor process.
Some small producers continued to use a batch process, notably in Maui.[33] In
1980, inspired by the Maui Chip, an entrepreneur started Cape_Cod_Potato_Chips
to produce thicker, batch-cooked "Hawaiian style" potato chips, which came to
be known as kettle-style (US) or hand-cooked (UK) chips and became a premium,
"gourmet" item.[34] Kettle chips are thicker and the surface starch is not
rinsed off, resulting in a style of chip called "hard bite".[35]
***** Nomenclature[edit] *****
A Bangladeshi version of potato chips, marketed as "potato crackers."
Little consistency exists in the English-speaking_world for names of fried
potato slices, thick or thin. American and Canadian English use "chips" for the
above-mentioned dish â this term is also used (but not universally) in other
parts of world, and sometimes "crisps" for the same made from batter.
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, "crisps" are potato chips which are eaten at
room temperature, whilst "chips" are similar to french_fries (as in "fish_and
chips") and are served hot.[36] In Australia, some parts of South_Africa, New
Zealand, India, the general West_Indies especially in Barbados, both forms of
potato product are simply known as "chips", as are the larger "home-style"
variety. In the north of New Zealand, they are known as "chippies", but are
marketed as "chips" throughout the country. In Australia and New Zealand,
sometimes the distinction is made between "hot chips" (fried potatoes) and
"chips" or "potato chips". In Bangladesh, they are generally known as "chip" or
"chips", and much less frequently as "crisps" (pronounced "kirisp") and
locally, alu bhaja (for their similarity to the fried potato dish, bhajji).
In German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany: "Kartoffelchips"; Switzerland:
"Pommes Chips") and in countries of the former SFR_Yugoslavia, fried thin
potato slices are known as "chips" (locally pronounced very similar to the
actual English pronunciation), with a clear distinction from french fries. In
Brazil, "home-style" potato chips are known as batatas portuguesas ("Portuguese
potatoes") if their sides are relatively smooth and batatas prussianas
("Prussian potatoes") if their sides show a wafer biscuit-like pattern, whilst
American-like industrial uniform potato chips made from a fried potato purÃ©e-
based dough are known as "batata chips" ("potato chips"), or just "chips".
***** Health concerns[edit] *****
Most potato chips contain high levels of sodium, from salt. This has been
linked to health issues such as high blood_pressure.[37] However, researchers
at Queen_Mary_University_of_London in 2004 have noted that a small "bag of
ready-salted crisps" contains less salt than a serving of many breakfast
cereals, including "every brand of cornflakes on sale in the UK."[38]
Some potato chip companies have responded to the long-standing concerns by
investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create
health-conscious products. PepsiCo research shows that about 80% of salt on
chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. Frito-Lay spent $414
million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals
that would reduce the salt content of Lay's potato chips without adversely
affecting flavor.[39]
Unsalted chips are available, e.g. the longstanding British brand Salt_'n'
Shake, whose chips are not seasoned, but instead include a small salt sachet in
the bag for seasoning to taste. Many other popular brands in the United States,
such as Frito-Lay, also offer such a product.
Another possible health concern related to potato chips is acrylamide, which is
produced when potatoes are fried or baked at high temperatures. Studies suggest
that rodents exposed to high levels of acrylamide develop cancer; however, it
is currently unclear whether a similar risk exists in humans. Many potato chip
manufacturers attempt to remove burned and thus potentially acrylamide-rich
chips before the packaging process. Large scanners are used to eliminate chips
worst affected by heat.[40]
***** Regional varieties[edit] *****
Salt and vinegar is a favorite variety of crisp in the United Kingdom and
Australia.
**** Canada[edit] ****
In Canada, seasonings include the unique all_dressed, as well as dill_pickle,
[41] jalapeÃ±o, ketchup,[41][42] barbecue, sour cream and onion, and salt and
vinegar. In 2006, Lay's introduced wasabi chips in Toronto and Vancouver,[43]
but no longer offers them.[44] Loblaw, Canada's largest food retailer, offers
several unusual flavors under its President's_Choice brand, including poutine,
maple bacon, Jamaican jerk chicken, Greek feta and olive, ballpark hot dog, and
barbecue baby back ribs.[45]
**** Hong Kong[edit] ****
In Hong_Kong, the two prominent potato chips are the spicy "Ethnican" variety
by Calbee,[46] and barbecue by Jack 'n Jill. Lay's are also popular in Hong
Kong.
**** Indonesia[edit] ****
In Indonesia, potato chips are commonly called as kripik kentang, traditionally
fell under kripik category. Indonesian potato chips market is mainly ruled by
two brands; Indofood's Chitato (since 1990s)[47] and Lay's (an Indofood and
Frito-Lay joint venture). In 2014, Japanese Calbee and Indonesian Wing's food
formed Calbeewings, a joint venture and marketed Potabee potato chips in
Indonesia.
Common potato chips flavors marketed in Indonesia include beef barbecue, spicy
chicken, cheese and plain salted. Lay's potato chips sold in Indonesia is
available in 6 flavors; honey butter, sour cream and onion, nori seaweed, beef
barbecue, classic salty, and salmon teriyaki flavors.[48] Potabee sold in
Indonesia offers two flavors; beef BBQ and grilled seaweed.[49] In 2018 Chitato
launched "Do Us A Flavor" campaign that sell three unusual flavors; beef
rendang, fried crab golden egg yolk, and mango sticky rice.[50]
**** Ireland[edit] ****
In Ireland, the two most popular flavors are cheese and onion, and salt and
vinegar. However in Ireland, the word "Tayto" is synonymous with potato chips
after the Tayto brand and can be used to describe all varieties of chips,
including those not produced by Tayto.[51] Hunky Dorys and King are other
popular Irish brands. In November 2010, the Tayto company opened a theme park
called "Tayto_Park".[52]
**** Mainland western Europe[edit] ****
In Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands only two flavors were traditionally
available, red_paprika (paprika, sometimes also called ungarisch) and salted
(gesalzen). These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some
vendors started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and
onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like "chakalaka",
"currywurst", "pommes" (french fries), "Rot-weiss" (red and white - french
fries with tomato_ketchup and mayonnaise). Potato chips made from ground
potatoes are called Stapelchips rather than Kartoffelchips for legal reasons.
[further_explanation_needed]
**** Colombia[edit] ****
In Colombia, lemon, chicken, chorizo, and sirloin_steak with mushroom_sauce
flavored potato chips are sold.[53]
A bowl of pizza-flavored chips in Japan
**** Japan[edit] ****
In Japan, flavors include norishio (nori and salt), consommÃ©, wasabi, soy
sauce and butter, garlic, plum, barbecue, pizza, mayonnaise, and black pepper.
Chili, scallop with butter, teriyaki, takoyaki, and yakitori chip flavors are
also available. Major manufacturers are Calbee,[54] Koikeya[55] and Yamayoshi.
**** United Kingdom[edit] ****
McCoy's crinkle-cut crisps
The market in the United Kingdom is led by Walkers, which held 56% of the
British crisp market in 2013.[56] Walkers is known for its wide variety of
crisps with the most popular flavours being Cheese & Onion, Salt & Vinegar,
Prawn Cocktail, Beef and Onion, Roast Chicken, Smoky Bacon, Worcester Sauce,
Pickled Onion, Tomato Ketchup, and Salt & Shake - Original.[57][58]
More exotic flavors are Thai sweet chili, roast pork and creamy mustard sauce,
lime and Thai spices, chicken with Italian herbs, Spicy Sriracha, BBQ Pulled
Pork, sea salt and cracked black pepper, sea salt and cider vinegar, spicy and
aromatic curry, turkey and bacon, caramelized onion and sweet balsamic vinegar,
Stilton and cranberry.[58] Since 2008, Walkers has launched its "Do Us a
Flavour" campaign, challenging the British public to think up unique flavours
for their crisps. Six flavours were chosen from among the entries and released
as special editions.[59] In 2014 the public had to pick one of Walkers' base
ingredients, which was made up of six flavours from around the UK â Somerset
Cheddar, Devonshire Chicken, Norfolk Pork, Dorset Sour Cream, Vale of Evesham
Tomatoes and Aberdeen_Angus Beef â then add their own unique flavour.[60] In
2018 Walkers launched six new flavours to celebrate the brandâs 70th
birthday, with each flavour representing a different decade.[57]
**** United States[edit] ****
In the United_States, potato chips are made by national chains like Frito-
Lay's, Pringles and Kettle Brand; major regional brands like Jay's of Chicago,
Better Made of Detroit and Old Dutch of Minneapolis; and specialty brands with
local or uneven distribution.
Potato chip flavorings include variations of barbecue, as well as sour cream
and onion, sour cream and cheddar, salt and vinegar, ranch, jalapeno and
cheese.[61] "Hot" is a common flavor such as Jay's Hot Stuff and Better Made
Red Hot. Better Made also make Rainbow chips, heavily cooked dark-colored chips
which would be rejected by most processors. In the Gulf_South, Zapp's of
Gramercy,_Louisiana, makes kettle-cooked chips using regional flavors such as
Crawtator, Cajun dill, Voodoo, and Creole onion.[62]
*** Pennsylvania[edit] ***
Pennsylvania leads the United States in potato chip production, and has been
dubbed "the Potato Chip Capital" by several sources.[63] Pennsylvania-based
companies that produce potato chips include Utz_Quality_Foods, Herr's_Snacks,
Snyder's_of_Hanover, Martin's_Potato_Chips, Wise_Foods, Middleswarth Potato
Chips,[64] Dieffenbach's Potato Chips,[65] Hartley's Potato Chips,[66] Gibbles
Foods,[67] Stehman's Potato Chips, and Charles_Chips. Many of these companies
are members of SNAC International, the global snack industry association.
***** Similar foods[edit] *****
Pringles potato chips are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be
stacked.
Another type of potato chip, notably the Pringles and Lay's_Stax brands, is
made by extruding or pressing a dough made from dehydrated potatoes into the
desired shape before frying. This makes chips that are uniform in size and
shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or
plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as "potato crisps" in the
US. Pringles may be termed "potato chips" in Britain, to distinguish them from
traditional "crisps". Munchos, another brand that uses the term "potato
crisps", has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though
the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.
An additional variant of potato chips exists in the form of "potato sticks",
also called "shoestring potatoes". These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3 mm)
versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular
salted potato chips. A hickory-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada,
going by the vending_machine name "Hickory Sticks". Potato sticks are typically
packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches,
similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in
hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the
less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). Reckitt
Benckiser was a market leader in this category[citation_needed] under the
Durkee Potato Stix and French's Potato Sticks names but exited the business in
2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.
A larger variant (about 1 cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed
as Andy_Capp's Pub_Fries, using the theme of a long-running British comic
strip, which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors. Walkers make a similar
product (using the Smiths brand) called "Chipsticks" which are sold in ready-
salted and salt and vinegar flavors.
Some companies have also marketed baked potato chips as an alternative with
lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been
made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well
known in the media when an ingredient many contained, Olestra, was linked in
some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.[68]
Many other products might be called "crisps" in Britain, but would not be
classed as "potato chips" because they are not made with potato or are not
chipped (for example, Wotsits, Quavers, Skips, Hula_Hoops, and Monster_Munch).
Kumara (sweet_potato) chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan;
parsnip, beetroot, and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom. India
is famous[citation_needed] for a large number of localized 'chips shops',
selling not only potato chips, but also other varieties such as plantain chips,
tapioca chips, yam chips, and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as
chifles or tostones, are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to
Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In
Kenya, chips are made from arrowroot and casava. In the United Kingdom, Sweden,
Finland, and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice has been
released and marketed as lower in fat than its potato counterparts.[69]
