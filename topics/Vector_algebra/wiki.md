In mathematics, vector algebra may mean:
    * Linear_algebra, specifically the basic algebraic operations of vector
      addition and scalar multiplication; see vector_space.
    * The algebraic operations in vector_calculus, namely the specific
      additional structure of vectors in 3-dimensional Euclidean_space       R
      3     {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{3}}  [\mathbf{R}^3] of dot_product and
      especially cross_product. In this sense, vector algebra is contrasted
      with geometric_algebra, which provides an alternative generalization to
      higher dimensions.
    * An algebra_over_a_field, a vector space equipped with a bilinear product
    * Original vector algebras of the nineteenth century like quaternions,
      tessarines, or coquaternions, each of which has its own product. The
      vector algebras biquaternions and hyperbolic_quaternions enabled the
      revolution in physics called special_relativity by providing mathematical
      models.
