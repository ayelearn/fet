Bees serve the ecological function of pollinating flowers, maintaining flora
reproduction and density in the ecosystem.
Functional ecology is a branch of ecology that focuses on the roles, or
functions, that species play in the community or ecosystem in which they occur.
In this approach, physiological, anatomical, and life history characteristics
of the species are emphasized. The term "function" is used to emphasize certain
physiological processes rather than discrete properties, describe an organism's
role in a trophic system, or illustrate the effects of natural selective
processes on an organism.[1] This sub-discipline of ecology represents the
crossroads between ecological patterns and the processes and mechanisms that
underlie them. It focuses on traits represented in large number of species and
can be measured in two ways. The first being screening, which involves
measuring a trait across a number of species, and the second being empiricism,
which provides quantitative relationships for the traits measured in screening.
[2] Functional ecology often emphasizes an integrative approach, using organism
traits and activities to understand community dynamics and ecosystem processes,
particularly in response to the rapid global changes occurring in earth's
environment.
Functional ecology sits at the nexus of several disparate disciplines and
serves as the unifying principle between evolutionary_ecology, evolutionary
biology, genetics and genomics, and traditional ecological studies, and
attempts to understand species' "competitive abilities, patterns of species co-
occurrence, community assembly, and the role of different traits on ecosystem
functioning".[3]

***** History[edit] *****
The notion that ecosystems' functions can be affected by their constituent
parts has its origins in the 19th century. Charles_Darwin's On_The_Origin_of
Species is one of the first texts to directly comment on the effect of
biodiversity on ecosystem health by noting a positive correlation between plant
density and ecosystem productivity.[3] In his influential 1927 work, Animal
Ecology, Charles_Elton proposed classifying an ecosystem based on the how its
members utilize resources.[4] By the 1950s, Elton's model of ecosystems was
widely accepted, where organisms that shared similarities in resource use
occupied the same 'guild' within an ecosystem.[3]
Beginning in the 1970s, an increased interest in functional classification
revolutionized functional ecology. 'Guilds' would be re-termed 'functional
groups', and classification schemes began to focus more on interactions between
species and trophic levels. Functional ecology became widely understood to be
the study of ecological processes that concern the adaptations of organism
within the ecosystem.[1] In the 1990s, biodiversity became better understood as
the diversity of species' ecological functions within an ecosystem, rather than
simply a great number of different species present.[3] Finally, in the 2000s
researchers began using functional classification schemes to examine
ecosystems' and organisms' responses to drastic change and disturbance, and the
impact of function loss on the health of an ecosystem.[3]
***** Functional Diversity[edit] *****
Functional diversity is widely considered to be âthe value and the range of
those species and organismal traits that influence ecosystem functioningâ[3]
In this sense, the use of the term âfunctionâ may apply to individuals,
populations, communities, trophic levels, or evolutionary process (i.e.
considering the function of adaptations).[3] Functional diversity was conceived
as an alternative classification to schemes using genetic diversity or
physiological diversity to measure the ecological importance of species in an
environment, as well as a way to understand how biodiversity affects specific
ecosystem functions, where in this context, 'biodiversity' refers to the
diversity of ecosystem functions present in a given system.[3] Understanding
ecosystems via functional diversity is as powerful as it is broadly applicable
and gives insight into observable patterns in ecosystems, such as species
occurrence, species competitive abilities, and the influence of biological
communities on ecosystem functioning.[3]
**** Impact on Ecosystem Health[edit] ****
A key interest of modern research in Functional Ecology is the impact of
functional diversity on ecosystem health. Unsurprisingly, biodiversity has a
positive impact on the productivity of an ecosystem.[5] Increased functional
diversity increases both the capacity of the ecosystem to regulate the flux of
energy and matter through the environment (Ecosystem Functions) as well as the
ecosystem's ability to produce resources beneficial to humans such as air,
water, and wood (Ecosystem Services).[5] Ecosystem Functions are drastically
reduced with decreases in the diversity of genes, species and functional groups
present within an ecosystem.[5] In fact, reductions in functional diversity
broadly impact the survivability of organisms in an environment regardless of
functional group, trophic level, or species, implying that the organization and
interaction of communities in an ecosystem has a profound impact on its ability
to function and self-sustain.[5] Furthermore, diversity improves environmental
stability. The greater an ecosystem's diversity, the more resilient it is to
changes in species composition (e.g. extinction events or invasive species) and
extraneous changes to environmental conditions (e.g. logging, farming, and
pollution).[5] Moreover, the benefits that diversity provides to an environment
scale non-linearly with the amount of diversity.[5] Unfortunately, this
relationship also acts in the opposite direction. The loss of diversity non-
linearly disrupts ecosystems (even stable ones); this negative impact is
especially detrimental when the loss is across trophic levels.[5] For, example,
the loss of a single tertiary predator can have cascading effects on the food
chain, resulting in reduction of plant biomass and genetic diversity.[5] This
in turn can alter the "vegetation structure, fire frequency, and even disease
epidemics in a range of ecosystems".[5] The effects of diversity on ecosystems
are so powerful, that they can rival the impact of climate change and other
global ecosystem stressors.[5]
Alternatively, in rare situations, diversity has been shown to retard
ecological productivity. In experimentally concocted microscopic environments,
a diverse culture of bacteria was unable to out-produce a homogeneous culture
of an 'efficient' control strain.[6] However, the statistical validity and
setup of these experiments have been questioned, and require further
investigation to carry substantial merit.[5] In general, the current consensus
that diversity is beneficial to ecosystem health has much more theoretical and
empirical support and is more widely applicable.
**** Scaling[edit] ****
Most models of complex functional diversity are only effective in a small range
of spatial scales.[7] However, by defining the functional trait probability
density as a "function representing the distribution of probabilities of
observing each possible trait value in a given ecological_unit," the results of
many models can be generalized to larger scales.[7] At larger spatial scales,
more environmental heterogeneity may increase opportunities for species to
exploit more functional groups.[5] Consistent with this conclusion, tests of
theoretical models predict that the net effects of biodiversity on ecosystem
functions grow stronger over time, over larger spatial scales, and with more
heterogeneous natural resources.[5] However, these results are expected to
underestimate the actual relationshipm impling that large space and time scales
coupled with diverse resources are more than necessary to sustain an ecosystem.
[5]
***** Applications of Functional Ecology[edit] *****
A functional approach to understanding and dealing with environments provides
numerous benefits to our understanding of biology and its applications in our
lives. While the concept of functional ecology is still in its infancy, it has
been widely applied throughout biological studies to better understand
organisms, environments, and their interactions.
**** Species Detection and Classification[edit] ****
The notions of functional ecology have beneficial implications for species
detection and classification. When detecting species, ecologically important
traits, such as plant height, influence the probability of detection during
field surveys.[8] When holistically analyzing an environment, the systematic
error of imperfect species detection can lead to incorrect trait-environment
evolutionary conclusions as well as poor estimates of functional trait
diversity and environmental role.[8] For example, if small species of insects
are less likely to be detected, researchers may conclude that they are much
more scarce (and thus less impactful) in the environment than larger species of
insects. This 'detection filtering' has major consequences on functional
packaging and the defining functional groups in an ecosystem.[8] Thankfully,
correlations between environmental change and evolutionary adaptation is are
much larger than the effects of imperfect species detection.[8] Nevertheless,
approaching ecosystems with theoretical maps of functional relationships
between species and groups can reduce the likelihood of improper detection and
improve the robustness of any biological conclusions drawn.
A functional approach to defining traits can even help species classification.
Trait focused schemes of taxonomy have long been used to classify species, but
the number and type of 'trait' to consider is widely debated. Considering more
traits in a classification scheme will separate species into more specific
functional groups, but may lead to an overestimation of total functional
diversity in the environment.[3] However, considering too few traits runs the
risk of classifying species as functionally redundant, when they are in fact
vital to the health of the ecosystem.[3] So, before one can classify organisms
by traits, the definition of 'trait' must be settled. Rather than define traits
as proxies for organism performance, as Darwin did, modern ecologists favor a
more robust definition of traits often referred to as "functional traits".[9]
Under this paradigm, functional traits are defined as morpho-physiophenological
traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth,
reproduction and survival.[9] Notice that is definition is not specific to
species. Since larger biological organizations grow, reproduce and sustain just
as individual organisms do, functional traits can be used to describe ecosystem
processes and properties as well.[9] To distinguish between functional traits
at different scales, the classification scheme adopts the following
nomenclature. Individual organisms have Ecophysiological traits and life-
history traits; populations have demographic traits; communities have response
traits; and ecosystems have effect traits.[9] At each level, functional traits
can directly and indirectly influence functional traits in the levels above or
below them.[9] For example, when averaged over an ecosystem, individual plants'
heights can contribute to ecosystem productivity or efficiency.[9]

**** Genomics[edit] ****
Functional Ecology is closely intertwined with genomics. Understanding the
functional niches that organisms occupy in a ecosystem can provide clues to
genetic differences between members of a genus.[10] On the other hand,
discovering the traits/functions that genes encode for yields insight into the
roles that organisms perform in their environment. This kind of genomic study
is referred to as genomic ecology or ecogenomics.[10] Genomic ecology can
classify traits on cellular and physiological levels leading to a more refined
classification system.[10] In addition, once genetic markers for functional
traits in individuals are identified, predictions about the functional
diversity and composition of an ecosystem can be made from the genetic data of
a few species in a process called "reverse ecology".[10] Reverse ecology can
contribute to better taxonomy of organisms as well. Rather than defining
species by genetic proximity alone, organisms can be additionally classified by
the functions they serve in the same ecology. This application of reverse
ecology has proven especially useful in the classification of bacteria.
Researchers were able to identify the correspondence between genetic variation
and ecological niche function in the genus Agrobacterium and their greater
biological implication on species distinction and diversity in the ecosystem.
[10] The researchers found that 196 genes specific to Agrobacterium fabrum
coded for metabolic pathways specific to plants which allowed for the use of
plant-specific compounds and sugars to avoid iron deficiency.[10] This trait,
unique to Agrobacterium fabrum, allowed it to avoid competition with closely
related bacteria in Agrobacterium found within the same environment.[10] Thus,
understanding the genetics of Agrobacterium fabrum allowed researchers to infer
that it evolved into the niche (i.e. ecological role) of a plant so that it
could avoid competing with its close relatives. If this process can be shown to
generalize, then the ecological functions of other organisms can be inferred
simply from genetic information.
However, reverse ecology and genomic ecology face several hurdles before they
can be accepted as rigorous and mainstream approaches to taxonomy or ecology.
One of the major challenges is that technologies for the sequencing and
comparison of transcriptomic data do not exist, making the acquisition of
transcriptomic data dependent on environmental conditions.[10] Additionally, as
studied environments increase in complexity, transcriptomic data becomes harder
to collect.[10] Furthermore, the functions that many discovered genes encode
for are still unknown making it difficult if not impossible to infer ecological
function from a genome.[10] Testing hypotheses concerning what functions given
genes encode for is difficult experimentally and is expensive and time-
consuming.[10]
**** De-extinction[edit] ****
Functional ecology also has broad applications to the science of and debate
over de-extinction, the resurrection of extinct species. Function ecology can
be applied to strategically assess the resurrection of extinct species to
maximize its impact on an environment.[11] To avoid reintroducing a species
that is rendered functionally redundant by one of its ancestors, a functional
analysis of global ecosystems can be performed to determine which ecosystems
would benefit most from the added functional diversity of the reintroduced
species.[11] These considerations are important because, while many species
currently being considered for de-extinction are terrestrial, they are also
functionally redundant in their former ecosystems.[11] However, many extinct
marine species have been identified as functionally unique in their
environments, even today, which makes a strong case for their reintroduction.
[11] In fact, while some functions have been recovered by evolution, as is the
case with many extinct terrestrial species, some functional gaps have widened
over time.[11] Reintroducing extinct species has the potential to close these
gaps, making richer, more balanced ecosystems.
Furthermore, before a species goes extinct in the classical sense of the word,
keeping a functional perspective in mind can avoid "functional extinction".[11]
Functional extinction is defined as "the point at which a species fails to
perform its historical functional role".[11] Endangered species such as species
of tigers, tuna and sea otters usually qualify for this threshold.[11] If
functional ecology is considered, new species (not necessarily extinct) can be
introduced into ecosystem where a species has become functionally extinct
before any de-extinction action ever needs to be taken. This can be a key
transformative process in ecological preservation and restoration because
functional extinction can have cascading effects on the health of an ecosystem.
[11][5] For example, species that engineer ecosystems such as beavers are
particularly unique functionally; their absence from an ecosystem could be
devastating.[11]
While functional arguments for reintroduction of extinct species, may paint
thoughtful reintroduction as a ecological boon, the ethical and practical
debate over de-extinction has not left functional approaches unscathed. The
main critique of functional arguments in favor of de-extinction are largely
focused on contentions that ecological functions are often ambiguously defined
and that it is unclear what functions must be present to define an ecosystem.
These arguments suggest that reintroducing an extinct species could be
drastically harm an ecosystem if conclusions about its function or the
functions of the species it is intended to replace are incorrect. Additionally,
even if an extinct species' function is well understood de-extinction could be
equally harmful if the function served by the extinct species is no longer
needed by the ecosystem.
