Emission lines and absorption lines compared to a continuous spectrum
Einstein coefficients are mathematical quantities which are a measure of the
probability of absorption or emission of light by an atom or molecule.[1] The
Einstein A coefficient is related to the rate of spontaneous_emission of light,
and the Einstein B coefficients are related to the absorption and stimulated
emission of light.

***** Spectral lines[edit] *****
In physics, one thinks of a spectral line from two viewpoints.
An emission line is formed when an atom or molecule makes a transition from a
particular discrete energy_level E2 of an atom, to a lower energy level E1,
emitting a photon of a particular energy and wavelength. A spectrum of many
such photons will show an emission spike at the wavelength associated with
these photons.
An absorption line is formed when an atom or molecule makes a transition from a
lower, E1, to a higher discrete energy state, E2, with a photon being absorbed
in the process. These absorbed photons generally come from background continuum
radiation (the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation) and a spectrum will
show a drop in the continuum radiation at the wavelength associated with the
absorbed photons.
The two states must be bound_states in which the electron is bound to the atom
or molecule, so the transition is sometimes referred to as a "boundâbound"
transition, as opposed to a transition in which the electron is ejected out of
the atom completely ("boundâfree" transition) into a continuum state, leaving
an ionized atom, and generating continuum radiation.
A photon with an energy equal to the difference E2 â E1 between the energy
levels is released or absorbed in the process. The frequency Î½ at which the
spectral line occurs is related to the photon energy by Bohr's_frequency
condition E2 â E1 = hÎ½ where h denotes Planck's_constant.[2][3][4][5][6][7]
***** Emission and absorption coefficients[edit] *****
An atomic spectral line refers to emission and absorption events in a gas in
which      n  2     {\displaystyle n_{2}}  [n_{2}] is the density of atoms in
the upper-energy state for the line, and      n  1     {\displaystyle n_{1}}
[n_{1}] is the density of atoms in the lower-energy state for the line.
The emission of atomic line radiation at frequency Î½ may be described by an
emission_coefficient     &#x03F5;   {\displaystyle \epsilon }  [\epsilon ] with
units of energy/(time Ã volume Ã solid angle). Îµ dt dV dÎ© is then the
energy emitted by a volume element     d V   {\displaystyle dV}  [dV] in time
d t   {\displaystyle dt}  [dt] into solid angle     d &#x03A9;   {\displaystyle
d\Omega }  [d\Omega ]. For atomic line radiation,
         &#x03F5; =    h &#x03BD;   4 &#x03C0;     n  2    A  21   ,
      {\displaystyle \epsilon ={\frac {h\nu }{4\pi }}n_{2}A_{21},}  [
      {\displaystyle \epsilon ={\frac {h\nu }{4\pi }}n_{2}A_{21},}]
where      A  21     {\displaystyle A_{21}}  [A_{21}] is the Einstein
coefficient for spontaneous emission, which is fixed by the intrinsic
properties of the relevant atom for the two relevant energy levels.
The absorption of atomic line radiation may be described by an absorption
coefficient     &#x03BA;   {\displaystyle \kappa }  [\kappa ] with units of 1/
length. The expression Îº' dx gives the fraction of intensity absorbed for a
light beam at frequency Î½ while traveling distance dx. The absorption
coefficient is given by
          &#x03BA; &#x2032;  =    h &#x03BD;   4 &#x03C0;    (  n  1    B  12
      &#x2212;  n  2    B  21   ) ,   {\displaystyle \kappa '={\frac {h\nu }
      {4\pi }}(n_{1}B_{12}-n_{2}B_{21}),}  [{\displaystyle \kappa '={\frac
      {h\nu }{4\pi }}(n_{1}B_{12}-n_{2}B_{21}),}]
where      B  12     {\displaystyle B_{12}}  [B_{12}] and      B  21
{\displaystyle B_{21}}  [B_{21}] are the Einstein coefficients for photon
absorption and induced emission respectively. Like the coefficient      A  21
{\displaystyle A_{21}}  [A_{21}], these are also fixed by the intrinsic
properties of the relevant atom for the two relevant energy levels. For
thermodynamics and for the application of Kirchhoff's_law, it is necessary that
the total absorption be expressed as the algebraic sum of two components,
described respectively by      B  12     {\displaystyle B_{12}}  [B_{12}] and
B  21     {\displaystyle B_{21}}  [B_{21}], which may be regarded as positive
and negative absorption, which are, respectively, the direct photon absorption,
and what is commonly called stimulated or induced emission.[8][9][10]
The above equations have ignored the influence of the spectroscopic_line_shape.
To be accurate, the above equations need to be multiplied by the (normalized)
spectral line shape, in which case the units will change to include a 1/Hz
term.
Under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, the number densities      n  2
{\displaystyle n_{2}}  [n_{2}] and      n  1     {\displaystyle n_{1}}  [n_
{1}], the Einstein coefficients, and the spectral energy density provide
sufficient information to determine the absorption and emission rates.
**** Equilibrium conditions[edit] ****
The number densities      n  2     {\displaystyle n_{2}}  [n_{2}] and      n  1
{\displaystyle n_{1}}  [n_{1}] are set by the physical state of the gas in
which the spectral line occurs, including the local spectral_radiance (or, in
some presentations, the local spectral radiant energy density). When that state
is either one of strict thermodynamic_equilibrium, or one of so-called "local
thermodynamic equilibrium",[11][12][13] then the distribution of atomic states
of excitation (which includes      n  2     {\displaystyle n_{2}}  [n_{2}] and
n  1     {\displaystyle n_{1}}  [n_{1}]) determines the rates of atomic
emissions and absorptions to be such that Kirchhoff's_law_of_equality_of
radiative_absorptivity_and_emissivity holds. In strict thermodynamic
equilibrium, the radiation field is said to be black-body_radiation and is
described by Planck's_law. For local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation
field does not have to be a black-body field, but the rate of interatomic
collisions must vastly exceed the rates of absorption and emission of quanta of
light, so that the interatomic collisions entirely dominate the distribution of
states of atomic excitation. Circumstances occur in which local thermodynamic
equilibrium does not prevail, because the strong radiative effects overwhelm
the tendency to the MaxwellâBoltzmann_distribution of molecular velocities.
For example, in the atmosphere of the Sun, the great strength of the radiation
dominates. In the upper atmosphere of the Earth, at altitudes over 100 km, the
rarity of intermolecular collisions is decisive.
In the cases of thermodynamic_equilibrium and of local_thermodynamic
equilibrium, the number densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may
be calculated from the MaxwellâBoltzmann_distribution, but for other cases,
(e.g. lasers) the calculation is more complicated.
***** Einstein coefficients[edit] *****
In 1916, Albert_Einstein proposed that there are three processes occurring in
the formation of an atomic spectral line. The three processes are referred to
as spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, and absorption. With each is
associated an Einstein coefficient, which is a measure of the probability of
that particular process occurring. Einstein considered the case of isotropic
radiation of frequency Î½ and spectral energy density Ï(Î½).[3][14]
**** Various formulations[edit] ****
Hilborn has compared various formulations for derivations for the Einstein
coefficients, by various authors.[15] For example, Herzberg works with
irradiance and wavenumber.[16] Yariv works with energy per unit volume per unit
frequency interval;[17] also;[18][clarify] this is how the present account is
formulated. Mihalas & Weibel-Mihalas work with radiance and frequency;[13] also
Chandrasekhar;[19] also Goody & Yung;[20] Loudon uses angular frequency and
radiance.[21]
**** Spontaneous emission[edit] ****
Main article: Spontaneous_emission
Schematic diagram of atomic spontaneous emission
Spontaneous emission is the process by which an electron "spontaneously" (i.e.
without any outside influence) decays from a higher energy level to a lower
one. The process is described by the Einstein coefficient A21 (s−1), which
gives the probability per unit time that an electron in state 2 with energy
E  2     {\displaystyle E_{2}}  [E_{2}] will decay spontaneously to state 1
with energy      E  1     {\displaystyle E_{1}}  [E_{1}], emitting a photon
with an energy E2 â E1 = hÎ½. Due to the energy-time_uncertainty_principle,
the transition actually produces photons within a narrow range of frequencies
called the spectral_linewidth. If      n  i     {\displaystyle n_{i}}  [n_{i}]
is the number density of atoms in state i , then the change in the number
density of atoms in state 2 per unit time due to spontaneous emission will be
           (    d  n  2     d t    )   spontaneous   = &#x2212;  A  21    n  2
      .   {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dn_{2}}{dt}}\right)_{\text
      {spontaneous}}=-A_{21}n_{2}.}  [{\displaystyle \left({\frac {dn_{2}}
      {dt}}\right)_{\text{spontaneous}}=-A_{21}n_{2}.}]
The same process results in increasing of the population of the state 1:
           (    d  n  1     d t    )   spontaneous   =  A  21    n  2   .
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dn_{1}}{dt}}\right)_{\text{spontaneous}}=A_
      {21}n_{2}.}  [{\displaystyle \left({\frac {dn_{1}}{dt}}\right)_{\text
      {spontaneous}}=A_{21}n_{2}.}]
**** Stimulated emission[edit] ****
Main article: Stimulated_emission
Schematic diagram of atomic stimulated emission
Stimulated_emission (also known as induced emission) is the process by which an
electron is induced to jump from a higher energy level to a lower one by the
presence of electromagnetic radiation at (or near) the frequency of the
transition. From the thermodynamic viewpoint, this process must be regarded as
negative absorption. The process is described by the Einstein coefficient
B  21     {\displaystyle B_{21}}  [B_{21}] (J−1 m3 s−2), which gives the
probability per unit time per unit spectral energy density of the radiation
field that an electron in state 2 with energy      E  2     {\displaystyle E_
{2}}  [E_{2}] will decay to state 1 with energy      E  1     {\displaystyle E_
{1}}  [E_{1}], emitting a photon with an energy E2 â E1 = hÎ½. The change in
the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to induced emission
will be
           (    d  n  1     d t    )   neg. absorb.   =  B  21    n  2
      &#x03C1; ( &#x03BD; ) ,   {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dn_{1}}
      {dt}}\right)_{\text{neg. absorb.}}=B_{21}n_{2}\rho (\nu ),}  [
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dn_{1}}{dt}}\right)_{\text{neg. absorb.}}=B_
      {21}n_{2}\rho (\nu ),}]
where     &#x03C1; ( &#x03BD; )   {\displaystyle \rho (\nu )}  [\rho(\nu)]
denotes the spectral energy density of the isotropic radiation field at the
frequency of the transition (see Planck's_law).
Stimulated emission is one of the fundamental processes that led to the
development of the laser. Laser radiation is, however, very far from the
present case of isotropic radiation.
**** Photon absorption[edit] ****
Main article: Absorption_(optics)
Schematic diagram of atomic absorption
Absorption is the process by which a photon is absorbed by the atom, causing an
electron to jump from a lower energy level to a higher one. The process is
described by the Einstein coefficient      B  12     {\displaystyle B_{12}}
[B_{12}] (J−1 m3 s−2), which gives the probability per unit time per unit
spectral energy density of the radiation field that an electron in state 1 with
energy      E  1     {\displaystyle E_{1}}  [E_{1}] will absorb a photon with
an energy E2 â E1 = hÎ½ and jump to state 2 with energy      E  2
{\displaystyle E_{2}}  [E_{2}]. The change in the number density of atoms in
state 1 per unit time due to absorption will be
           (    d  n  1     d t    )   pos. absorb.   = &#x2212;  B  12    n  1
      &#x03C1; ( &#x03BD; ) .   {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dn_{1}}
      {dt}}\right)_{\text{pos. absorb.}}=-B_{12}n_{1}\rho (\nu ).}  [
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dn_{1}}{dt}}\right)_{\text{pos. absorb.}}=-
      B_{12}n_{1}\rho (\nu ).}]
***** Detailed balancing[edit] *****
The Einstein coefficients are fixed probabilities per time associated with each
atom, and do not depend on the state of the gas of which the atoms are a part.
Therefore, any relationship that we can derive between the coefficients at,
say, thermodynamic equilibrium will be valid universally.
At thermodynamic equilibrium, we will have a simple balancing, in which the net
change in the number of any excited atoms is zero, being balanced by loss and
gain due to all processes. With respect to bound-bound transitions, we will
have detailed_balancing as well, which states that the net exchange between any
two levels will be balanced. This is because the probabilities of transition
cannot be affected by the presence or absence of other excited atoms. Detailed
balance (valid only at equilibrium) requires that the change in time of the
number of atoms in level 1 due to the above three processes be zero:
         0 =  A  21    n  2   +  B  21    n  2   &#x03C1; ( &#x03BD; ) &#x2212;
      B  12    n  1   &#x03C1; ( &#x03BD; ) .   {\displaystyle 0=A_{21}n_{2}+B_
      {21}n_{2}\rho (\nu )-B_{12}n_{1}\rho (\nu ).}  [{\displaystyle 0=A_{21}n_
      {2}+B_{21}n_{2}\rho (\nu )-B_{12}n_{1}\rho (\nu ).}]
Along with detailed balancing, at temperature T we may use our knowledge of the
equilibrium energy distribution of the atoms, as stated in the
MaxwellâBoltzmann_distribution, and the equilibrium distribution of the
photons, as stated in Planck's_law_of_black_body_radiation to derive universal
relationships between the Einstein coefficients.
From Boltzmann distribution we have for the number of excited atomic species i:
            n  i   n   =     g  i    e  &#x2212;  E  i    /  k T    Z   ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {n_{i}}{n}}={\frac {g_{i}e^{-E_{i}/kT}}{Z}},}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {n_{i}}{n}}={\frac {g_{i}e^{-E_{i}/kT}}{Z}},}]
where n is the total number density of the atomic species, excited and
unexcited, k is Boltzmann's_constant, T is the temperature,      g  i
{\displaystyle g_{i}}  [g_{i}] is the degeneracy (also called the multiplicity)
of state i, and Z is the partition_function. From Planck's law of black-body
radiation at temperature T we have for the spectral energy density at frequency
Î½
          &#x03C1;  &#x03BD;   ( &#x03BD; , T ) = F ( &#x03BD; )   1   e  h
      &#x03BD;  /  k T   &#x2212; 1    ,   {\displaystyle \rho _{\nu }(\nu
      ,T)=F(\nu ){\frac {1}{e^{h\nu /kT}-1}},}  [{\displaystyle \rho _{\nu }
      (\nu ,T)=F(\nu ){\frac {1}{e^{h\nu /kT}-1}},}]
where[17]
         F ( &#x03BD; ) =    8 &#x03C0; h  &#x03BD;  3     c  3     ,
      {\displaystyle F(\nu )={\frac {8\pi h\nu ^{3}}{c^{3}}},}  [{\displaystyle
      F(\nu )={\frac {8\pi h\nu ^{3}}{c^{3}}},}]
where     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] is the speed_of_light and     h
{\displaystyle h}  [h] is Planck's_constant.
Substituting these expressions into the equation of detailed balancing and
remembering that E2 â E1 = hÎ½ yields
          A  21    g  2    e  &#x2212; h &#x03BD;  /  k T   +  B  21    g  2
      e  &#x2212; h &#x03BD;  /  k T      F ( &#x03BD; )    e  h &#x03BD;  /  k
      T   &#x2212; 1    =  B  12    g  1      F ( &#x03BD; )    e  h &#x03BD;
      /  k T   &#x2212; 1    ,   {\displaystyle A_{21}g_{2}e^{-h\nu /kT}+B_
      {21}g_{2}e^{-h\nu /kT}{\frac {F(\nu )}{e^{h\nu /kT}-1}}=B_{12}g_{1}{\frac
      {F(\nu )}{e^{h\nu /kT}-1}},}  [{\displaystyle A_{21}g_{2}e^{-h\nu /kT}+B_
      {21}g_{2}e^{-h\nu /kT}{\frac {F(\nu )}{e^{h\nu /kT}-1}}=B_{12}g_{1}{\frac
      {F(\nu )}{e^{h\nu /kT}-1}},}]
separating to
          A  21    g  2   (  e  h &#x03BD;  /  k T   &#x2212; 1 ) +  B  21    g
      2   F ( &#x03BD; ) =  B  12    g  1    e  h &#x03BD;  /  k T   F
      ( &#x03BD; ) .   {\displaystyle A_{21}g_{2}(e^{h\nu /kT}-1)+B_{21}g_{2}F
      (\nu )=B_{12}g_{1}e^{h\nu /kT}F(\nu ).}  [{\displaystyle A_{21}g_{2}(e^
      {h\nu /kT}-1)+B_{21}g_{2}F(\nu )=B_{12}g_{1}e^{h\nu /kT}F(\nu ).}]
The above equation must hold at any temperature, so
          B  21    g  2   =  B  12    g  1   ,   {\displaystyle B_{21}g_{2}=B_
      {12}g_{1},}  [{\displaystyle B_{21}g_{2}=B_{12}g_{1},}]
and
         &#x2212;  A  21    g  2   +  B  21    g  2   F ( &#x03BD; ) = 0.
      {\displaystyle -A_{21}g_{2}+B_{21}g_{2}F(\nu )=0.}  [{\displaystyle -A_
      {21}g_{2}+B_{21}g_{2}F(\nu )=0.}]
Therefore, the three Einstein coefficients are interrelated by
            A  21    B  21     = F ( &#x03BD; )   {\displaystyle {\frac {A_
      {21}}{B_{21}}}=F(\nu )}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {A_{21}}{B_{21}}}=F(\nu
      )}]
and
            B  21    B  12     =    g  1    g  2     .   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {B_{21}}{B_{12}}}={\frac {g_{1}}{g_{2}}}.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {B_
      {21}}{B_{12}}}={\frac {g_{1}}{g_{2}}}.}]
When this relation is inserted into the original equation, one can also find a
relation between      A  21     {\displaystyle A_{21}}  [A_{21}] and      B  12
{\displaystyle B_{12}}  [B_{12}], involving Planck's_law.
***** Oscillator strengths[edit] *****
The oscillator strength      f  12     {\displaystyle f_{12}}  [f_{12}] is
defined by the following relation to the cross section     &#x03C3;
{\displaystyle \sigma }  [\sigma ] for absorption:[15]
         &#x03C3; =    e  2    4  &#x03B5;  0    m  e   c      f  12
      &#x03D5;  &#x03BD;   =    &#x03C0;  e  2     2  &#x03B5;  0    m  e   c
      f  12     &#x03D5;  &#x03C9;   ,   {\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {e^{2}}
      {4\varepsilon _{0}m_{e}c}}\,f_{12}\,\phi _{\nu }={\frac {\pi e^{2}}
      {2\varepsilon _{0}m_{e}c}}\,f_{12}\,\phi _{\omega },}  [{\displaystyle
      \sigma ={\frac {e^{2}}{4\varepsilon _{0}m_{e}c}}\,f_{12}\,\phi _{\nu }=
      {\frac {\pi e^{2}}{2\varepsilon _{0}m_{e}c}}\,f_{12}\,\phi _{\omega },}]
where     e   {\displaystyle e}  [e] is the electron charge,      m  e
{\displaystyle m_{e}}  [m_{e}] is the electron mass, and      &#x03D5;
&#x03BD;     {\displaystyle \phi _{\nu }}  [{\displaystyle \phi _{\nu }}] and
&#x03D5;  &#x03C9;     {\displaystyle \phi _{\omega }}  [{\displaystyle \phi _
{\omega }}] are normalized distribution functions in frequency and angular
frequency respectively. This allows all three Einstein coefficients to be
expressed in terms of the single oscillator strength associated with the
particular atomic spectral line:
          B  12   =    e  2    4  &#x03B5;  0    m  e   h &#x03BD;     f  12
      ,   {\displaystyle B_{12}={\frac {e^{2}}{4\varepsilon _{0}m_{e}h\nu }}f_
      {12},}  [{\displaystyle B_{12}={\frac {e^{2}}{4\varepsilon _{0}m_{e}h\nu
      }}f_{12},}]
          B  21   =    e  2    4  &#x03B5;  0    m  e   h &#x03BD;       g  1
      g  2      f  12   ,   {\displaystyle B_{21}={\frac {e^{2}}{4\varepsilon _
      {0}m_{e}h\nu }}{\frac {g_{1}}{g_{2}}}f_{12},}  [{\displaystyle B_{21}=
      {\frac {e^{2}}{4\varepsilon _{0}m_{e}h\nu }}{\frac {g_{1}}{g_{2}}}f_
      {12},}]
          A  21   =    2 &#x03C0;  &#x03BD;  2    e  2      &#x03B5;  0    m  e
      c  3         g  1    g  2      f  12   .   {\displaystyle A_{21}={\frac
      {2\pi \nu ^{2}e^{2}}{\varepsilon _{0}m_{e}c^{3}}}{\frac {g_{1}}{g_{2}}}f_
      {12}.}  [{\displaystyle A_{21}={\frac {2\pi \nu ^{2}e^{2}}{\varepsilon _
