Equality of two mathematical expressions
For other uses, see Equation_(disambiguation).
The first use of an equals sign, equivalent to 14x + 15 = 71 in modern
notation. From The_Whetstone_of_Witte by Robert_Recorde of Wales (1557).[1]
In mathematics, an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two
expressions. The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have
subtly different meanings; for example, in French an Ã©quation is defined as
containing one or more variables, while in English any equality is an equation.
[2]
Solving_an_equation containing variables consists of determining which values
of the variables make the equality true. Variables are also called unknowns and
the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of
the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional
equations. An identity is true for all values of the variable. A conditional
equation is only true for particular values of the variables.[3][4]
An equation is written as two expressions, connected by a equals_sign ("=").
The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the "left-hand
side" and "right-hand side" of the equation.
The most common type of equation is an algebraic_equation, in which the two
sides are algebraic_expressions. Each side of an algebraic equation will
contain one or more terms. For example, the equation
         A  x  2   + B x + C = y   {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C=y}  [
      {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C=y}]
has left-hand side     A  x  2   + B x + C   {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C}  [
{\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C}], which has three terms, and right-hand side     y
{\displaystyle y}  [y], consisting of just one term. The unknowns are x and y
and the parameters are A, B, and C.
An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal
weights of something (grain for example) are placed into the two pans, the two
weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a
quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of
grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance.
Likewise, to keep an equation in balance, the same operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division must be performed on both sides of an
equation for it to remain true.
In geometry, equations are used to describe geometric_figures. As the equations
that are considered, such as implicit_equations or parametric_equations, have
infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving
the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses
equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of
algebraic_geometry, an important area of mathematics.
Algebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial_equations and, among
them, the special case of linear_equations. When there is only one variable,
polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and
linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. To
solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric
techniques that originate from linear_algebra or mathematical_analysis. Algebra
also studies Diophantine_equations where the coefficients and solutions are
integers. The techniques used are different and come from number_theory. These
equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the
existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of
solutions.
Differential_equations are equations that involve one or more functions and
their derivatives. They are solved by finding an expression for the function
that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model
processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in
areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.
The "=" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert
Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight
lines with the same length.[1]

***** Introduction[edit] *****
**** Analogous illustration[edit] ****
Illustration of a simple equation; x, y, z are real numbers, analogous to
weights.
An equation is analogous to a weighing_scale, balance, or seesaw.
Each side of the equation corresponds to one side of the balance. Different
quantities can be placed on each side: if the weights on the two sides are
equal, the scale balances, and in analogy the equality that represents the
balance is also balanced (if not, then the lack of balance corresponds to an
inequality represented by an inequation).
In the illustration, x, y and z are all different quantities (in this case real
numbers) represented as circular weights, and each of x, y, and z has a
different weight. Addition corresponds to adding weight, while subtraction
corresponds to removing weight from what is already there. When equality holds,
the total weight on each side is the same.
**** Parameters and unknowns[edit] ****
See also: Expression_(mathematics)
Equations often contain terms other than the unknowns. These other terms, which
are assumed to be known, are usually called constants, coefficients or
parameters.
An example of an equation involving x and y as unknowns and the parameter R is
          x  2   +  y  2   =  R  2   .   {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}.}  [
      {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}.}]
When Ris chosen to have the value of 2 (R= 2), this equation would be
recognized, when sketched in Cartesian_coordinates, as the equation for a
particular circle with a radius of 2. Hence, the equation with R unspecified is
the general equation for the circle.
Usually, the unknowns are denoted by letters at the end of the alphabet, x, y,
z, w, â¦, while coefficients (parameters) are denoted by letters at the
beginning, a, b, c, d, â¦ . For example, the general quadratic_equation is
usually written ax2 + bx + c = 0. The process of finding the solutions, or, in
case of parameters, expressing the unknowns in terms of the parameters is
called solving_the_equation. Such expressions of the solutions in terms of the
parameters are also called solutions.
A system_of_equations is a set of simultaneous equations, usually in several
unknowns, for which the common solutions are sought. Thus a solution to the
system is a set of values for each of the unknowns, which together form a
solution to each equation in the system. For example, the system
             3 x + 5 y    = 2     5 x + 8 y    = 3       {\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}3x+5y&=2\\5x+8y&=3\end{aligned}}}  [{\begin
      {aligned}3x+5y&=2\\5x+8y&=3\end{aligned}}]
has the unique solution x = â1, y = 1.
**** Identities[edit] ****
Main articles: Identity_(mathematics) and List_of_trigonometric_identities
An identity is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variable
(s) it contains. Many identities are known in algebra and calculus. In the
process of solving an equation, an identity is often used to simplify an
equation making it more easily solvable.
In algebra, an example of an identity is the difference_of_two_squares:
          x  2   &#x2212;  y  2   = ( x + y ) ( x &#x2212; y )   {\displaystyle
      x^{2}-y^{2}=(x+y)(x-y)}  [x^{2}-y^{2}=(x+y)(x-y)]
which is true for all x and y.
Trigonometry is an area where many identities exist; these are useful in
manipulating or solving trigonometric_equations. Two of many that involve the
sine and cosine functions are:
          sin  2   &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) +  cos  2   &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) = 1
      {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}(\theta )+\cos ^{2}(\theta )=1}  [{\displaystyle
      \sin ^{2}(\theta )+\cos ^{2}(\theta )=1}]
and
         sin &#x2061; ( 2 &#x03B8; ) = 2 sin &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) cos &#x2061;
      ( &#x03B8; )   {\displaystyle \sin(2\theta )=2\sin(\theta )\cos(\theta )}
      [\sin(2\theta )=2\sin(\theta )\cos(\theta )]
which are both true for all values of Î¸.
For example, to solve for the value of Î¸ that satisfies the equation:
         3 sin &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) cos &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) = 1  ,
      {\displaystyle 3\sin(\theta )\cos(\theta )=1\,,}  [3\sin(\theta )\cos
      (\theta )=1\,,]
where Î¸ is known to be limited to between 0 and 45 degrees, we may use the
above identity for the product to give:
           3 2   sin &#x2061; ( 2 &#x03B8; ) = 1  ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {3}
      {2}}\sin(2\theta )=1\,,}  [{\frac {3}{2}}\sin(2\theta )=1\,,]
yielding the solution for Î¸
         &#x03B8; =   1 2   arcsin &#x2061;  (   2 3   )  &#x2248;  20.9
      &#x2218;   .   {\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {1}{2}}\arcsin \left({\frac
      {2}{3}}\right)\approx 20.9^{\circ }.}  [\theta ={\frac {1}{2}}\arcsin
      \left({\frac {2}{3}}\right)\approx 20.9^{\circ }.]
Since the sine function is a periodic_function, there are infinitely many
solutions if there are no restrictions on Î¸. In this example, the restriction
that Î¸ be between 0 and 45 degrees implies there is only one solution.
***** Properties[edit] *****
Two equations or two systems of equations are equivalent if they have the same
set of solutions. The following operations transform an equation or a system of
equations into an equivalent one â provided that the operations are
meaningful for the expressions they are applied to:
    * Adding or subtracting the same quantity to both sides of an equation.
      This shows that every equation is equivalent to an equation in which the
      right-hand side is zero.
    * Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by a non-zero quantity.
    * Applying an identity to transform one side of the equation. For example,
      expanding a product or factoring a sum.
    * For a system: adding to both sides of an equation the corresponding side
      of another equation, multiplied by the same quantity.
If some function is applied to both sides of an equation, the resulting
equation has the solutions of the initial equation among its solutions, but may
have further solutions called extraneous_solutions. For example, the equation
x = 1   {\displaystyle x=1}  [x=1] has the solution     x = 1.   {\displaystyle
x=1.}  [x=1.] Raising both sides to the exponent of 2 (which means applying the
function     f ( s ) =  s  2     {\displaystyle f(s)=s^{2}}  [f(s)=s^{2}] to
both sides of the equation) changes the equation to      x  2   = 1
{\displaystyle x^{2}=1}  [x^{2}=1], which not only has the previous solution
but also introduces the extraneous solution,     x = &#x2212; 1.
{\displaystyle x=-1.}  [x=-1.] Moreover, if the function is not defined at some
values (such as 1/x, which is not defined for x = 0), solutions existing at
those values may be lost. Thus, caution must be exercised when applying such a
transformation to an equation.
The above transformations are the basis of most elementary methods for equation
solving as well as some less elementary ones, like Gaussian_elimination.

***** Algebra[edit] *****
**** Polynomial equations[edit] ****
Main article: Polynomial_equation
The solutions â1 and 2 of the polynomial equation x2 â x + 2 = 0 are the
points where the graph of the quadratic_function y = x2 â x + 2 cuts the x-
axis.
In general, an algebraic equation or polynomial_equation is an equation of the
form
         P = 0   {\displaystyle P=0}  [P=0], or
         P = Q   {\displaystyle P=Q}  [P=Q]
where P and Q are polynomials with coefficients in some field (real numbers,
complex numbers, etc.), which is often the field of the rational_numbers. An
algebraic equation is univariate if it involves only one variable. On the other
hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables, in which case it is
called multivariate (multiple variables, x, y, z, etc.). The term polynomial
equation is usually preferred to algebraic equation.
For example,
          x  5   &#x2212; 3 x + 1 = 0   {\displaystyle x^{5}-3x+1=0}  [x^{5}-
      3x+1=0]
is a univariate algebraic (polynomial) equation with integer coefficients and
          y  4   +    x y  2   =    x  3   3   &#x2212; x  y  2   +  y  2
      &#x2212;   1 7     {\displaystyle y^{4}+{\frac {xy}{2}}={\frac {x^{3}}
      {3}}-xy^{2}+y^{2}-{\frac {1}{7}}}  [y^{4}+{\frac {xy}{2}}={\frac {x^{3}}
      {3}}-xy^{2}+y^{2}-{\frac {1}{7}}]
is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rational numbers.
Some but not all polynomial equations with rational_coefficients have a
solution that is an algebraic_expression with a finite number of operations
involving just those coefficients (that is, it can be solved_algebraically).
This can be done for all such equations of degree one, two, three, or four; but
for degree five or more it can be solved for some equations but, as the
AbelâRuffini_theorem demonstrates, not for all. A large amount of research
has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the real or
complex solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see Root-finding
algorithm) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial
equations (see System_of_polynomial_equations).
**** Systems of linear equations[edit] ****
The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art is an anonymous Chinese book
proposing a method of resolution for linear equations.
A system_of_linear_equations (or linear system) is a collection of linear
equations involving the same set of variables.[a] For example,
             3 x     +     2 y     &#x2212;     z     =     1      2 x
      &#x2212;     2 y     +     4 z     =     &#x2212; 2      &#x2212; x     +
      1 2    y     &#x2212;     z     =     0        {\displaystyle {\begin
      {alignedat}{7}3x&&\;+\;&&2y&&\;-\;&&z&&\;=\;&&1&\\2x&&\;-
      \;&&2y&&\;+\;&&4z&&\;=\;&&-2&\\-x&&\;+\;&&{\tfrac {1}{2}}y&&\;-
      \;&&z&&\;=\;&&0&\end{alignedat}}}  [{\begin{alignedat}
      {7}3x&&\;+\;&&2y&&\;-\;&&z&&\;=\;&&1&\\2x&&\;-\;&&2y&&\;+\;&&4z&&\;=\;&&-
      2&\\-x&&\;+\;&&{\tfrac {1}{2}}y&&\;-\;&&z&&\;=\;&&0&\end{alignedat}}]
is a system of three equations in the three variables x, y, z. A solution to a
linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the
equations are simultaneously satisfied. A solution to the system above is given
by
             x     =    1     y     =    &#x2212; 2     z     =    &#x2212; 2
      {\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{2}x&\,=\,&1\\y&\,=\,&-2\\z&\,=\,&-2\end
      {alignedat}}}  [{\begin{alignedat}{2}x&\,=\,&1\\y&\,=\,&-2\\z&\,=\,&-
      2\end{alignedat}}]
since it makes all three equations valid. The word "system" indicates that the
equations are to be considered collectively, rather than individually.
In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is the basis and a fundamental
part of linear_algebra, a subject which is used in most parts of modern
mathematics. Computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an
important part of numerical_linear_algebra, and play a prominent role in
physics, engineering, chemistry, computer_science, and economics. A system_of
non-linear_equations can often be approximated by a linear system (see
linearization), a helpful technique when making a mathematical_model or
computer_simulation of a relatively complex system.
***** Geometry[edit] *****
**** Analytic geometry[edit] ****
A conic_section is the intersection of a plane and a cone of revolution.
In Euclidean_geometry, it is possible to associate a set of coordinates to each
point in space, for example by an orthogonal grid. This method allows one to
characterize geometric figures by equations. A plane in three-dimensional space
can be expressed as the solution set of an equation of the form     a x + b y +
c z + d = 0   {\displaystyle ax+by+cz+d=0}  [ax+by+cz+d=0], where     a , b , c
{\displaystyle a,b,c}  [a,b,c] and     d   {\displaystyle d}  [d] are real
numbers and     x , y , z   {\displaystyle x,y,z}  [x,y,z] are the unknowns
that correspond to the coordinates of a point in the system given by the
orthogonal grid. The values     a , b , c   {\displaystyle a,b,c}  [a,b,c] are
the coordinates of a vector perpendicular to the plane defined by the equation.
A line is expressed as the intersection of two planes, that is as the solution
set of a single linear equation with values in       R   2     {\displaystyle
\mathbb {R} ^{2}}  [\mathbb {R} ^{2}] or as the solution set of two linear
equations with values in       R   3   .   {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}.}
[\mathbb {R} ^{3}.]
A conic_section is the intersection of a cone with equation      x  2   +  y  2
=  z  2     {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}}  [x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}] and a plane.
In other words, in space, all conics are defined as the solution set of an
equation of a plane and of the equation of a cone just given. This formalism
allows one to determine the positions and the properties of the focuses of a
conic.
The use of equations allows one to call on a large area of mathematics to solve
geometric questions. The Cartesian_coordinate system transforms a geometric
problem into an analysis problem, once the figures are transformed into
equations; thus the name analytic_geometry. This point of view, outlined by
Descartes, enriches and modifies the type of geometry conceived of by the
ancient Greek mathematicians.
Currently, analytic geometry designates an active branch of mathematics.
Although it still uses equations to characterize figures, it also uses other
sophisticated techniques such as functional_analysis and linear_algebra.
**** Cartesian equations[edit] ****
A Cartesian_coordinate_system is a coordinate_system that specifies each point
uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed
distances from the point to two fixed perpendicular directed lines, that are
marked using the same unit_of_length.
One can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in three-
dimensional space by the use of three Cartesian coordinates, which are the
signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by
its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines).
Cartesian coordinate system with a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin
marked in red. The equation of a circle is (x â a)2 + (y â b)2 = r2 where a
and b are the coordinates of the center (a, b) and r is the radius.
The invention of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by RenÃ©_Descartes
(Latinized name: Cartesius) revolutionized mathematics by providing the first
systematic link between Euclidean_geometry and algebra. Using the Cartesian
coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as curves) can be described by
Cartesian equations: algebraic equations involving the coordinates of the
points lying on the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2 in a plane,
centered on a particular point called the origin, may be described as the set
of all points whose coordinates x and y satisfy the equation x2 + y2 = 4.
**** Parametric equations[edit] ****
Main article: Parametric_equation
A parametric_equation for a curve expresses the coordinates of the points of
the curve as functions of a variable, called a parameter.[5][6] For example,
             x    = cos &#x2061; t     y    = sin &#x2061; t
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=\cos t\\y&=\sin t\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\begin{aligned}x&=\cos t\\y&=\sin t\end{aligned}}]
are parametric equations for the unit_circle, where t is the parameter.
Together, these equations are called a parametric representation of the curve.
The notion of parametric equation has been generalized to surfaces, manifolds
and algebraic_varieties of higher dimension, with the number of parameters
being equal to the dimension of the manifold or variety, and the number of
equations being equal to the dimension of the space in which the manifold or
variety is considered (for curves the dimension is one and one parameter is
used, for surfaces dimension two and two parameters, etc.).
***** Number theory[edit] *****
**** Diophantine equations[edit] ****
Main article: Diophantine_equation
A Diophantine equation is a polynomial_equation in two or more unknowns for
which only the integer solutions are sought (an integer solution is a solution
such that all the unknowns take integer values). A linear Diophantine equation
is an equation between two sums of monomials of degree zero or one. An example
of linear Diophantine equation is ax + by = c where a, b, and c are constants.
An exponential Diophantine equation is one for which exponents of the terms of
the equation can be unknowns.
Diophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve
finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical
language, they define an algebraic_curve, algebraic_surface, or more general
object, and ask about the lattice_points on it.
The word Diophantine refers to the Hellenistic_mathematician of the 3rd
century, Diophantus of Alexandria, who made a study of such equations and was
one of the first mathematicians to introduce symbolism into algebra. The
mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now
called Diophantine analysis.
**** Algebraic and transcendental numbers[edit] ****
Main articles: Algebraic_number and Transcendental_number
An algebraic_number is a number that is a solution of a non-zero polynomial
equation in one variable with rational coefficients (or equivalently â by
clearing_denominators â with integer coefficients). Numbers such as Ï that
are not algebraic are said to be transcendental. Almost_all real and complex
numbers are transcendental.
**** Algebraic geometry[edit] ****
Main article: Algebraic_geometry
Algebraic_geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying solutions
of polynomial_equations. Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract
techniques of abstract_algebra, especially commutative_algebra, with the
language and the problems of geometry.
The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic_varieties,
which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems_of_polynomial
equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are:
plane_algebraic_curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses,
hyperbolas, cubic_curves like elliptic_curves and quartic curves like
lemniscates, and Cassini_ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic
curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions
involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular_points,
the inflection_points and the points_at_infinity. More advanced questions
involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by
different equations.
***** Differential equations[edit] *****
Main article: Differential_equation
A strange_attractor, which arises when solving a certain differential_equation.
A differential_equation is a mathematical equation that relates some function
with its derivatives. In applications, the functions usually represent physical
quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the equation
defines a relationship between the two. Because such relations are extremely
common, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines
including physics, engineering, economics, and biology.
In pure_mathematics, differential equations are studied from several different
perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions â the set of functions
that satisfy the equation. Only the simplest differential equations are
solvable by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given
differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form.
If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may
be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical_systems
puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential
equations, while many numerical_methods have been developed to determine
solutions with a given degree of accuracy.
**** Ordinary differential equations[edit] ****
Main article: Ordinary_differential_equation
An ordinary_differential_equation or ODE is an equation containing a function
of one independent_variable and its derivatives. The term "ordinary" is used in
contrast with the term partial_differential_equation, which may be with respect
to more than one independent variable.
Linear differential equations, which have solutions that can be added and
multiplied by coefficients, are well-defined and understood, and exact closed-
form solutions are obtained. By contrast, ODEs that lack additive solutions are
nonlinear, and solving them is far more intricate, as one can rarely represent
them by elementary_functions in closed form: Instead, exact and analytic
solutions of ODEs are in series or integral form. Graphical and numerical
methods, applied by hand or by computer, may approximate solutions of ODEs and
perhaps yield useful information, often sufficing in the absence of exact,
analytic solutions.
**** Partial differential equations[edit] ****
Main article: Partial_differential_equation
A partial_differential_equation (PDE) is a differential_equation that contains
unknown multivariable_functions and their partial_derivatives. (This is in
contrast to ordinary_differential_equations, which deal with functions of a
single variable and their derivatives.) PDEs are used to formulate problems
involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or
used to create a relevant computer_model.
PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as sound, heat,
electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid_flow, elasticity, or quantum_mechanics.
These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in
terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-
dimensional dynamical_systems, partial differential equations often model
multidimensional_systems. PDEs find their generalisation in stochastic_partial
differential_equations.
***** Types of equations[edit] *****
Equations can be classified according to the types of operations and quantities
involved. Important types include:
    * An algebraic_equation or polynomial equation is an equation in which both
      sides are polynomials (see also system_of_polynomial_equations). These
      are further classified by degree:
          o linear_equation for degree one
          o quadratic_equation for degree two
          o cubic_equation for degree three
          o quartic_equation for degree four

    * A Diophantine_equation is an equation where the unknowns are required to
      be integers
    * A transcendental_equation is an equation involving a transcendental
      function of its unknowns
    * A parametric_equation is an equation in which the solutions for the
      variables are expressed as functions of some other variables, called
      parameters appearing in the equations
    * A functional_equation is an equation in which the unknowns are functions
      rather than simple quantities
    * Equations involving derivatives, integrals and finite differences:
          o A differential_equation is a functional equation involving
            derivatives of the unknown functions, where the function and its
            derivatives are evaluated at the same point, such as      f
            &#x2032;  ( x ) =  x  2     {\displaystyle f'(x)=x^{2}}  [
            {\displaystyle f'(x)=x^{2}}]. Differential equations are subdivided
            into ordinary_differential_equations for functions of a single
            variable and partial_differential_equations for functions of
            multiple variables
          o An integral_equation is a functional equation involving the
            antiderivatives of the unknown functions. For functions of one
            variable, such an equation differs from a differential equation
            primarily through a change of variable substituting the function by
            its derivative, however this is not the case when the integral is
            taken over an open surface
          o An integro-differential_equation is a functional equation involving
            both the derivatives and the antiderivatives of the unknown
            functions. For functions of one variable, such an equation differs
            from integral and differential equations through a similar change
            of variable.
          o A functional_differential_equation of delay_differential_equation
            is a function equation involving derivatives of the unknown
            functions, evaluated at multiple points, such as      f &#x2032;
            ( x ) = f ( x &#x2212; 2 )   {\displaystyle f'(x)=f(x-2)}  [
            {\displaystyle f'(x)=f(x-2)}]
          o A difference_equation is an equation where the unknown is a
            function f that occurs in the equation through f(x), f(xâ1), â¦,
            f(xâk), for some whole integer k called the order of the
            equation. If x is restricted to be an integer, a difference
            equation is the same as a recurrence_relation
          o A stochastic_differential_equation is a differential equation in
            which one or more of the terms is a stochastic_process
