Stem cells are cells that can differentiate into other types of cells, and can
also divide in self-renewal to produce more of the same type of stem cells.
In mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: embryonic_stem_cells,
which are isolated from the inner_cell_mass of blastocysts in early embryonic
development, and adult_stem_cells, which are found in various tissues of fully
developed mammals. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor_cells act as a
repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing embryo,
stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cellsâectoderm,
endoderm and mesoderm (see induced_pluripotent_stem_cells)âbut also maintain
the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal
tissues.
There are three known accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in
humans: bone_marrow, adipose_tissue, and blood. Stem cells can also be taken
from umbilical_cord_blood just after birth. Of all stem cell therapy types,
autologous harvesting involves the least risk.
Adult stem cells are frequently used in various medical therapies (e.g., bone
marrow_transplantation). Stem cells can now be artificially_grown and
transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics
consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves. Embryonic
cell_lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through somatic_cell
nuclear_transfer or dedifferentiation have also been proposed as promising
candidates for future therapies.[1] Research into stem cells grew out of
findings by Ernest_A._McCulloch and James_E._Till at the University_of_Toronto
in the 1960s.[2][3]

***** Properties[edit] *****
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two
properties:
    * Self-renewal: the ability to go through numerous cycles of cell_division
      while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
    * Potency: the capacity to differentiate into specialized cell types. In
      the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either totipotent or
      pluripotentâto be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although
      multipotent or unipotent progenitor_cells are sometimes referred to as
      stem cells. Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is
      regulated in a feed back mechanism.
**** Self-renewal[edit] ****
Two mechanisms ensure that a stem cell population is maintained:
1. Obligatory_asymmetric_replication: a stem cell divides into one mother cell
that is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell that is
differentiated.
When a stem cell self-renews it divides and does not disrupt the
undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well
as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell.
[4]
2. Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell develops into two
differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes mitosis and produces
two stem cells identical to the original.
**** Potency meaning[edit] ****
Main article: Cell_potency
Pluripotent, embryonic stem cells originate as inner cell mass (ICM) cells
within a blastocyst. These stem cells can become any tissue in the body,
excluding a placenta. Only cells from an earlier stage of the embryo, known as
the morula, are totipotent, able to become all tissues in the body and the
extraembryonic placenta.
Human embryonic stem cells
A: Stem cell colonies that are not yet differentiated.
B: Nerve cells, an example of a cell_type after differentiation.
Potency specifies the differentiation potential (the potential to differentiate
into different cell types) of the stem cell.[5]
    * Totipotent (a.k.a. omnipotent) stem cells can differentiate into
      embryonic and extraembryonic cell types. Such cells can construct a
      complete, viable organism.[5] These cells are produced from the fusion of
      an egg and sperm cell. Cells produced by the first few divisions of the
      fertilized egg are also totipotent.[6]
    * Pluripotent stem cells are the descendants of totipotent cells and can
      differentiate into nearly all cells,[5] i.e. cells derived from any of
      the three germ_layers.[7]
    * Multipotent stem cells can differentiate into a number of cell types, but
      only those of a closely related family of cells.[5]
    * Oligopotent stem cells can differentiate into only a few cell types, such
      as lymphoid or myeloid stem cells.[5]
    * Unipotent cells can produce only one cell type, their own,[5] but have
      the property of self-renewal, which distinguishes them from non-stem
      cells (e.g. progenitor_cells, which cannot self-renew).
**** Identification[edit] ****
In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue.
For example, the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic_stem_cells
(HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without
HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long
term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted
individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual
without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.
Properties of stem cells can be illustrated in_vitro, using methods such as
clonogenic_assays, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to
differentiate and self-renew.[8][9] Stem cells can also be isolated by their
possession of a distinctive set of cell surface markers. However, in vitro
culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether
the cells shall behave in a similar manner in_vivo. There is considerable
debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.
[10]
***** Embryonic[edit] *****
Main article: Embryonic_stem_cell
Embryonic_stem_cells (ESCs) are the cells of the inner_cell_mass of a
blastocyst, formed prior to implantation in the uterus.[11] In human_embryonic
development the blastocyst stage is reached 4â5 days after fertilization, at
which time it consists of 50â150 cells. ESCs are pluripotent and give rise
during development to all derivatives of the three germ_layers: ectoderm,
endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more
than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary
stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the
extraembryonic_membranes or to the placenta.
During embryonic development the cells of the inner cell mass continuously
divide and become more specialized. For example, a portion of the ectoderm in
the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as 'neurectoderm', which will become
the future central_nervous_system.[12][page needed] Later in development,
neurulation causes the neurectoderm to form the neural_tube. At the neural tube
stage, the anterior portion undergoes encephalization to generate or 'pattern'
the basic form of the brain. At this stage of development, the principal cell
type of the CNS is considered a neural_stem_cell.
The neural stem cells self-renew and at some point transition into radial_glial
progenitor_cells (RGPs). Early-formed RGPs self-renew by symmetrical division
to form a reservoir group of progenitor_cells. These cells transition to a
neurogenic state and start to divide asymmetrically to produce a large
diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression,
morphological, and functional characteristics. The process of generating
neurons from radial glial cells is called neurogenesis. The radial glial cell,
has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning
the thickness of the neural tube wall. It shares some glial characteristics,
most notably the expression of glial_fibrillary_acidic_protein (GFAP).[13][14]
The radial glial cell is the primary neural stem cell of the developing
vertebrate CNS, and its cell body resides in the ventricular_zone, adjacent to
the developing ventricular_system. Neural stem cells are committed to the
neuronal lineages (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), and thus their
potency is restricted.[12]
Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or
human embryonic stem cells (hES) derived from the early inner cell mass. Both
have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different
environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are
grown on a layer of gelatin as an extracellular_matrix (for support) and
require the presence of leukemia_inhibitory_factor (LIF) in serum media. A drug
cocktail containing inhibitors to GSK3B and the MAPK/ERK_pathway, called 2i,
has also been shown to maintain pluripotency in stem cell culture.[15] Human
ESCs are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and require the
presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2).[16] Without optimal
culture conditions or genetic manipulation,[17] embryonic stem cells will
rapidly differentiate.
A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several
transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors Oct-
4, Nanog, and Sox2 form the core regulatory network that ensures the
suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of
pluripotency.[18] The cell surface antigens most commonly used to identify hES
cells are the glycolipids stage_specific_embryonic_antigen_3 and 4, and the
keratan sulfate antigens Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81. The molecular definition of a
stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research.
[19]
By using human embryonic stem cells to produce specialized cells like nerve
cells or heart cells in the lab, scientists can gain access to adult human
cells without taking tissue from patients. They can then study these
specialized adult cells in detail to try to discern complications of diseases,
or to study cell reactions to proposed new drugs.
Because of their combined abilities of unlimited expansion and pluripotency,
embryonic stem cells remain a theoretically potential source for regenerative
medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease.[20], however, there
are currently no approved treatments using ES cells. The first human trial was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in January 2009.[21] However,
the human trial was not initiated until October 13, 2010 in Atlanta for spinal
cord_injury_research. On November 14, 2011 the company conducting the trial
(Geron_Corporation) announced that it will discontinue further development of
its stem cell programs.[22] Differentiating ES cells into usable cells while
avoiding transplant rejection are just a few of the hurdles that embryonic stem
cell researchers still face.[23]Embryonic stem cells, being pluripotent,
require specific signals for correct differentiation â if injected directly
into another body, ES cells will differentiate into many different types of
cells, causing a teratoma. Ethical considerations regarding the use of unborn
human tissue are another reason for the lack of approved treatments using
embryonic stem cells. Many nations currently have moratoria or limitations on
either human ES cell research or the production of new human ES cell lines.

***** Fetal[edit] *****
The primitive stem cells located in the organs of fetuses are referred to as
fetal stem cells.[24] There are two types of fetal stem cells:
   1. Fetal proper stem cells come from the tissue of the fetus proper, and are
      generally obtained after an abortion. These stem cells are not immortal
      but have a high level of division and are multipotent.
   2. Extraembryonic fetal stem cells come from extraembryonic_membranes, and
      are generally not distinguished from adult stem cells. These stem cells
      are acquired after birth, they are not immortal but have a high level of
      cell division, and are pluripotent.[25]
***** Adult[edit] *****
Main article: Adult_stem_cell
Stem cell division and differentiation A: stem cell; B: progenitor cell; C:
 differentiated cell; 1: symmetric stem cell division; 2: asymmetric stem cell
division; 3: progenitor division; 4: terminal differentiation
Adult stem cells, also called somatic (from Greek ÏÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÎºÃ³Ï, "of the
body") stem cells, are stem cells which maintain and repair the tissue in which
they are found.[26] They can be found in children, as well as adults.[27]
There are three known accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in
humans:
   1. Bone_marrow, which requires extraction by harvesting, that is, drilling
      into bone (typically the femur or iliac_crest).
   2. Adipose tissue (fat cells), which requires extraction by liposuction.[28]
   3. Blood, which requires extraction through apheresis, wherein blood is
      drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a
      machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the
      blood to the donor.
Stem cells can also be taken from umbilical_cord_blood just after birth. Of all
stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition,
autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or
her own blood for elective surgical procedures.
Pluripotent adult stem cells are rare and generally small in number, but they
can be found in umbilical cord blood and other tissues.[29] Bone marrow is a
rich source of adult stem cells,[30] which have been used in treating several
conditions including liver cirrhosis,[31] chronic limb ischemia [32] and
endstage heart failure.[33] The quantity of bone marrow stem cells declines
with age and is greater in males than females during reproductive years.[34]
Much adult stem cell research to date has aimed to characterize their potency
and self-renewal capabilities.[35] DNA damage accumulates with age in both stem
cells and the cells that comprise the stem cell environment. This accumulation
is considered to be responsible, at least in part, for increasing stem cell
dysfunction with aging (see DNA_damage_theory_of_aging).[36]
Most adult stem cells are lineage-restricted (multipotent) and are generally
referred to by their tissue origin (mesenchymal_stem_cell, adipose-derived stem
cell, endothelial_stem_cell, dental_pulp_stem_cell, etc.).[37][38] Muse_cells
(multi-lineage differentiating stress enduring cells) are a recently discovered
pluripotent stem cell type found in multiple adult tissues, including adipose,
dermal fibroblasts, and bone marrow. While rare, muse cells are identifiable by
their expression of SSEA-3, a marker for undifferentiated stem cells, and
general mesenchymal stem cells markers such as CD105. When subjected to single
cell suspension culture, the cells will generate clusters that are similar to
embryoid bodies in morphology as well as gene expression, including canonical
pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog.[39]
Adult stem cell treatments have been successfully used for many years to treat
leukemia and related bone/blood cancers through bone marrow transplants.[40]
Adult stem cells are also used in veterinary medicine to treat tendon and
ligament injuries in horses.[41]
The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as controversial as
the use of embryonic_stem_cells, because the production of adult stem cells
does not require the destruction of an embryo. Additionally, in instances where
adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an autograft), the
risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government
funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.[42]
With the increasing demand of human adult stem cells for both research and
clinical purposes (typically 1â5 million cells per kg of body weight are
required per treatment) it becomes of utmost importance to bridge the gap
between the need to expand the cells in vitro and the capability of harnessing
the factors underlying replicative senescence. Adult stem cells are known to
have a limited lifespan in vitro and to enter replicative senescence almost
undetectably upon starting in vitro culturing.[43]
***** Amniotic[edit] *****
Multipotent stem cells are also found in amniotic_fluid. These stem cells are
very active, expand extensively without feeders and are not tumorigenic.
Amniotic_stem_cells are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of
adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.
[44] Amniotic stem cells are a topic of active research.
Use of stem cells from amniotic_fluid overcomes the ethical objections to using
human embryos as a source of cells. Roman_Catholic teaching forbids the use of
embryonic stem cells in experimentation; accordingly, the Vatican newspaper
"Osservatore_Romano" called amniotic stem cells "the future of medicine".[45]
It is possible to collect amniotic stem cells for donors or for autologous use:
the first US amniotic stem cells bank [46][47] was opened in 2009 in Medford,
MA, by Biocell_Center Corporation[48][49][50] and collaborates with various
hospitals and universities all over the world.[51]
***** Induced pluripotent[edit] *****
Main article: Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell
Adult stem cells have limitations with their potency; unlike embryonic_stem
cells (ESCs), they are not able to differentiate into cells from all three germ
layers. As such, they are deemed multipotent.
However, reprogramming allows for the creation of pluripotent cells, induced
pluripotent_stem_cells (iPSCs), from adult cells. These are not adult stem
cells, but adult cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to
cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein
transcription_factors, pluripotent stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have
been derived.[52][53][54] The first demonstration of induced pluripotent stem
cells was conducted by Shinya_Yamanaka and his colleagues at Kyoto_University.
[55] They used the transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 to
reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells.[52][56] Subsequent
work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells.[57]
Junying_Yu, James_Thomson, and their colleagues at the University_of
WisconsinâMadison used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and
Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human foreskin.[52]
[58] However, they were able to replicate Yamanaka's finding that inducing
pluripotency in human cells was possible.
Induced pluripotent stem cells differ from embryonic stem cells. They share
many similar properties, such as pluripotency and differentiation potential,
the expression of pluripotency genes, epigenetic patterns, embryoid_body and
teratoma formation, and viable chimera formation,[55][56] but there are many
differences within these properties. The chromatin of iPSCs appears to be more
"closed" or methylated than that of ESCs.[55][56] Similarly, the gene
expression pattern between ESCs and iPSCs, or even iPSCs sourced from different
origins.[55] There are thus questions about the "completeness" of reprogramming
and the somatic memory of induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite this,
inducing adult_cells to be pluripotent appears to be viable.
As a result of the success of these experiments, Ian_Wilmut, who helped create
the first cloned animal Dolly_the_Sheep, has announced that he will abandon
somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer as an avenue of research.[59]
Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cells provide several therapeutic
advantages. Like ESCs, they are pluripotent. They thus have great
differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within
the human body (if reprogramming to pluripotency was "complete").[55] Moreover,
unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem
cell line for each individual patient.[60] Frozen blood samples can be used as
a valuable source of induced pluripotent stem cells.[61] Patient specific stem
cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well
as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection.[60] Despite their current
limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold create potential for future use in
medical treatment and research.
***** Lineage[edit] *****
Main article: Stem_cell_line
To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see Stem
cell division and differentiation diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to
two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric
division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a progenitor_cell
with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds
of cell division before terminally differentiating into a mature cell. It is
possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric
divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as
receptors) between the daughter cells.[62]
An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to
environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when
they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in Drosophila
germarium have identified the signals decapentaplegic and adherens junctions
that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.[63][64]
***** Treatments[edit] *****
Main article: Stem_cell_therapy
Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or
condition. Bone_marrow_transplant is a form of stem cell therapy that has been
used for many years without controversy.[65][66]
**** Advantages[edit] ****
Stem cell treatments may lower symptoms of the disease or condition that is
being treated. The lowering of symptoms may allow patients to reduce the drug
intake of the disease or condition. Stem cell treatment may also provide
knowledge for society to further stem cell understanding and future treatments.
[67]
**** Disadvantages[edit] ****
Stem cell treatments may require immunosuppression because of a requirement for
radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or
because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to
avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is
being treated.
Pluripotency in certain stem cells could also make it difficult to obtain a
specific cell type. It is also difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed,
because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly. Undifferentiated
cells can create tissues other than desired types.[68]
Some stem cells form tumors after transplantation;[69] pluripotency is linked
to tumor formation especially in embryonic stem cells, fetal proper stem cells,
induced pluripotent stem cells. Fetal proper stem cells form tumors despite
multipotency.[70]
***** Research[edit] *****
Further information: Consumer_Watchdog_vs._Wisconsin_Alumni_Research_Foundation
Some of the fundamental patents covering human embryonic stem cells are owned
by the Wisconsin_Alumni_Research_Foundation (WARF) â they are patents
5,843,780, 6,200,806, and 7,029,913 invented by James_A._Thomson. WARF does not
enforce these patents against academic scientists, but does enforce them
against companies.[71]
In 2006, a request for the US_Patent_and_Trademark_Office (USPTO) to re-examine
the three patents was filed by the Public_Patent_Foundation on behalf of its
client, the non-profit patent-watchdog group Consumer_Watchdog (formerly the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights).[71] In the re-examination
process, which involves several rounds of discussion between the USPTO and the
parties, the USPTO initially agreed with Consumer Watchdog and rejected all the
claims in all three patents,[72] however in response, WARF amended the claims
of all three patents to make them more narrow, and in 2008 the USPTO found the
amended claims in all three patents to be patentable. The decision on one of
the patents (7,029,913) was appealable, while the decisions on the other two
were not.[73][74] Consumer Watchdog appealed the granting of the '913 patent to
the USPTO's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) which granted the
appeal, and in 2010 the BPAI decided that the amended claims of the '913 patent
were not patentable.[75] However, WARF was able to re-open prosecution of the
case and did so, amending the claims of the '913 patent again to make them more
narrow, and in January 2013 the amended claims were allowed.[76]
In July 2013, Consumer Watchdog announced that it would appeal the decision to
allow the claims of the '913 patent to the US Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal
Circuit (CAFC), the federal appeals court that hears patent cases.[77] At a
hearing in December 2013, the CAFC raised the question of whether Consumer
Watchdog had legal_standing to appeal; the case could not proceed until that
issue was resolved.[78]
**** Treatment[edit] ****
Diseases and conditions where stem cell treatment is being investigated.
Diseases and conditions where stem cell treatment is being investigated
include:
    * Diabetes[79]
    * Rheumatoid_arthritis[79]
    * Parkinson's_disease[79]
    * Alzheimer's_disease[79]
    * Osteoarthritis[79]
    * Stroke and traumatic_brain_injury repair[80]
    * Learning_disability due to congenital_disorder [81]
    * Spinal_cord_injury repair [82]
    * Heart_infarction [83]
    * Anti-cancer treatments [84]
    * Baldness reversal[85]
    * Replace missing teeth [86]
    * Repair hearing [87]
    * Restore vision [88] and repair damage to the cornea[89]
    * Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis [90]
    * Crohn's_disease [91]
    * Wound_healing [92]
    * Male_infertility due to absence of spermatogonial stem cells.[93] In
      recent studies, scientist have found a way to solve this problem by
      reprogramming a cell and turning it into a spermatozoon. Other studies
      have proven the restoration of spermatogenesis by introducing human iPSC
      cells in mice testicles. This could mean the end of azoospermia.[94]
    * Female_infertility: oocytes made from embryonic stem cells. Recently,
      scientists have found the ovarian stem cells, a rare type of cells
      (0,014%) found in the ovary. It is not clear their existence yet, but the
      impact it could have are limitless. It could be used as a treatment not
      only for infertility, but also for premature ovarian insufficiency.[95]
Research is underway to develop various sources for stem cells, and to apply
stem cell treatments for neurodegenerative_diseases and conditions, diabetes,
heart_disease, and other conditions.[96] Research is also underway in
generating organoids using stem cells, which would allow for further
understanding of human development, organogenesis, and modeling of human
diseases.[97]
In more recent years, with the ability of scientists to isolate and culture
embryonic_stem_cells, and with scientists' growing ability to create stem cells
using somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer and techniques to create induced
pluripotent_stem_cells, controversy has crept in, both related to abortion
politics and to human_cloning.
Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury account for a substantial number
of failures of new drugs in development and market withdrawal, highlighting the
need for screening assays such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that
are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug_development process.[98]
