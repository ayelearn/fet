Fermentation is a metabolic process that produces chemical changes in organic
substrates through the action of enzymes. In biochemistry, it is narrowly
defined as the extraction of energy from carbohydrates in the absence of
oxygen. In_the_context_of_food_production, it may more broadly refer to any
process in which the activity of microorganisms brings about a desirable change
to a foodstuff or beverage.[1] The science of fermentation is known as
zymology.
In microorganisms, fermentation is the primary means of producing ATP by the
degradation of organic nutrients anaerobically.[2] Humans have used
fermentation to produce foodstuffs and beverages since the Neolithic_age. For
example, fermentation is used for preservation in a process that produces
lactic_acid found in such sour foods as pickled_cucumbers, kimchi, and yogurt,
as well as for producing_alcoholic_beverages_such_as_wine and beer.
Fermentation occurs within the gastrointestinal tracts of all animals,
including humans.[3]

***** Definitions[edit] *****
Below are some definitions of fermentation. They range from informal, general
usages to more scientific definitions.[4]
   1. Preservation methods for food via microorganisms (general use).
   2. Any process that produces alcoholic beverages or acidic dairy products
      (general use).
   3. Any large-scale microbial process occurring with or without air (common
      definition used in industry).
   4. Any energy-releasing metabolic process that takes place only under
      anaerobic conditions (becoming more scientific).
   5. Any metabolic process that releases energy from a sugar or other organic
      molecule, does not require oxygen or an electron transport system, and
      uses an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor (most
      scientific).
***** Biological role[edit] *****
Along with photosynthesis and aerobic_respiration, fermentation is a way of
extracting energy from molecules, but it is the only one common to all bacteria
and eukaryotes. It is therefore considered the oldest metabolic_pathway,
suitable for an environment that does not yet have oxygen.[5]:389 Yeast, a form
of fungus, occurs in almost any environment capable of supporting microbes,
from the skins of fruits to the guts of insects and mammals and the deep ocean,
and they harvest sugar-rich materials to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.[6]
[7]
The basic mechanism for fermentation remains present in all cells of higher
organisms. Mammalian muscle carries out the fermentation that occurs during
periods of intense exercise where oxygen supply becomes limited, resulting in
the creation of lactic_acid.[8]:63 In invertebrates, fermentation also produces
succinate and alanine.[9]:141
Fermentative bacteria play an essential role in the production of methane in
habitats ranging from the rumens of cattle to sewage digesters and freshwater
sediments. They produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide, formate and acetate and
carboxylic_acids; and then consortia of microbes convert the carbon dioxide and
acetate to methane. Acetogenic bacteria oxidize the acids, obtaining more
acetate and either hydrogen or formate. Finally, methanogens (which are in the
domain Archea) convert acetate to methane.[10]
***** Biochemical overview[edit] *****
Comparison of aerobic respiration and most known fermentation types in
eucaryotic cell.[11] Numbers in circles indicate counts of carbon atoms in
molecules, C6 is glucose C6H12O6, C1 carbon_dioxide CO2. Mitochondrial outer
membrane is omitted.
Fermentation reacts NADH with an endogenous, organic electron_acceptor.[2]
Usually this is pyruvate formed from sugar through glycolysis. The reaction
produces NAD+ and an organic product, typical examples being ethanol, lactic
acid, carbon_dioxide, and hydrogen_gas_(H2). However, more exotic compounds can
be produced by fermentation, such as butyric_acid and acetone. Fermentation
products contain chemical energy (they are not fully oxidized), but are
considered waste products, since they cannot be metabolized further without the
use of oxygen.
Fermentation normally occurs in an anaerobic_environment. In the presence of
O2, NADH, and pyruvate are used to generate ATP in respiration. This is called
oxidative_phosphorylation, and it generates much more ATP than glycolysis
alone. For that reason, fermentation is rarely utilized when oxygen is
available. However, even in the presence of abundant oxygen, some strains of
yeast such as Saccharomyces_cerevisiae prefer fermentation to aerobic
respiration as long as there is an adequate supply of sugars (a phenomenon
known as the Crabtree_effect).[12] Some fermentation processes involve obligate
anaerobes, which cannot tolerate oxygen.
Although yeast carries out the fermentation in the production of ethanol in
beers, wines, and other alcoholic drinks, this is not the only possible agent:
bacteria carry out the fermentation in the production of xanthan_gum.
***** Products[edit] *****
**** Ethanol[edit] ****
Main article: Ethanol_fermentation
Overview of ethanol fermentation.
In ethanol fermentation, one glucose molecule is converted into two ethanol
molecules and two carbon_dioxide molecules.[13][14] It is used to make bread
dough rise: the carbon dioxide forms bubbles, expanding the dough into a foam.
[15][16] The ethanol is the intoxicating agent in alcoholic beverages such as
wine, beer and liquor.[17] Fermentation of feedstocks, including sugarcane,
corn, and sugar_beets, produces ethanol that is added to gasoline.[18] In some
species of fish, including goldfish and carp, it provides energy when oxygen is
scarce (along with lactic acid fermentation).[19]
The figure illustrates the process. Before fermentation, a glucose molecule
breaks down into two pyruvate molecules. The energy from this exothermic
reaction is used to bind inorganic phosphates to ATP and convert NAD+ to NADH.
The pyruvates break down into two acetaldehyde molecules and give off two
carbon_dioxide molecules as a waste product. The acetaldehyde is reduced into
ethanol using the energy and hydrogen from NADH, and the NADH is oxidized into
NAD+ so that the cycle may repeat. The reaction is catalysed by the enzymes
pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase.[13]
**** Lactic acid[edit] ****
Main article: Lactic_acid_fermentation
Homolactic fermentation (producing only lactic acid) is the simplest type of
fermentation. The pyruvate from glycolysis[20] undergoes a simple redox
reaction, forming lactic_acid.[21][22] It is unique because it is one of the
only respiration processes to not produce a gas as a byproduct. Overall, one
molecule of glucose (or any six-carbon sugar) is converted to two molecules of
lactic acid:
      C6H12O6 â 2 CH3CHOHCOOH
It occurs in the muscles of animals when they need energy faster than the blood
can supply oxygen. It also occurs in some kinds of bacteria (such as
lactobacilli) and some fungi. It is the type of bacteria that converts lactose
into lactic acid in yogurt, giving it its sour taste. These lactic acid
bacteria can carry out either homolactic_fermentation, where the end-product is
mostly lactic acid, or Heterolactic fermentation, where some lactate is further
metabolized and results in ethanol and carbon dioxide[21] (via the
phosphoketolase pathway), acetate, or other metabolic products, e.g.:
      C6H12O6 â CH3CHOHCOOH + C2H5OH + CO2
If lactose is fermented (as in yogurts and cheeses), it is first converted into
glucose and galactose (both six-carbon sugars with the same atomic formula):
      C12H22O11 + H2O â 2 C6H12O6
Heterolactic fermentation is in a sense intermediate between lactic_acid
fermentation and other types, e.g. alcoholic_fermentation (see below). The
reasons to go further and convert lactic acid into anything else are:
    * The acidity of lactic acid impedes biological processes. This can be
      beneficial to the fermenting organism as it drives out competitors that
      are unadapted to the acidity. As a result, the food will have a longer
      shelf life (part of the reason foods are purposely fermented in the first
      place); however, beyond a certain point, the acidity starts affecting the
      organism that produces it.
    * The high concentration of lactic acid (the final product of fermentation)
      drives the equilibrium backwards (Le_Chatelier's_principle), decreasing
      the rate at which fermentation can occur and slowing down growth.
    * Ethanol, into which lactic acid can be easily converted, is volatile and
      will readily escape, allowing the reaction to proceed easily. CO2 is also
      produced, but it is only weakly acidic and even more volatile than
      ethanol.
    * Acetic acid (another conversion product) is acidic and not as volatile as
      ethanol; however, in the presence of limited oxygen, its creation from
      lactic acid releases additional energy. It is a lighter molecule than
      lactic acid, that forms fewer hydrogen bonds with its surroundings (due
      to having fewer groups that can form such bonds), thus is more volatile
      and will also allow the reaction to move forward more quickly.
    * If propionic_acid, butyric_acid, and longer monocarboxylic acids are
      produced (see mixed_acid_fermentation), the amount of acidity produced
      per glucose consumed will decrease, as with ethanol, allowing faster
      growth.
**** Hydrogen gas[edit] ****
Main article: Fermentative_hydrogen_production
Hydrogen gas is produced in many types of fermentation (mixed_acid
fermentation, butyric_acid fermentation, caproate fermentation, butanol
fermentation, glyoxylate fermentation) as a way to regenerate NAD+ from NADH.
Electrons are transferred to ferredoxin, which in turn is oxidized by
hydrogenase, producing H2.[13] Hydrogen gas is a substrate for methanogens and
sulfate_reducers, which keep the concentration of hydrogen low and favor the
production of such an energy-rich compound,[23] but hydrogen gas at a fairly
high concentration can nevertheless be formed, as in flatus.
As an example of mixed acid fermentation, bacteria such as Clostridium
pasteurianum ferment glucose producing butyrate, acetate, carbon_dioxide, and
hydrogen gas:[24] The reaction leading to acetate is:
      C6H12O6 + 4 H2O → 2 CH3COOâ + 2 HCO3â + 4 H+ + 4 H2
Glucose could theoretically be converted into just CO2 and H2, but the global
reaction releases little energy.
***** Modes of operation[edit] *****
Most industrial fermentation uses batch or fed-batch procedures, although
continuous fermentation can be more economical if various challenges,
particularly the difficulty of maintaining sterility, can be met.[25]
**** Batch[edit] ****
In a batch process, all the ingredients are combined and the reactions proceed
without any further input. Batch fermentation has been used for millennia to
make bread and alcoholic beverages, and it is still a common method, especially
when the process is not well understood.[26]:1 However, it can be expensive
because the fermentor must be sterilized using high pressure steam between
batches.[25] Strictly speaking, there is often addition of small quantities of
chemicals to control the pH or suppress foaming.[26]:25
Batch fermentation goes through a series of phases. There is a lag phase in
which cells adjust to their environment; then a phase in which exponential
growth occurs. Once many of the nutrients have been consumed, the growth slows
and becomes non-exponential, but production of secondary metabolites (including
commercially important antibiotics and enzymes) accelerates. This continues
through a stationary phase after most of the nutrients have been consumed, and
then the cells die.[26]:25
**** Fed-batch[edit] ****
See also: Fed-batch_culture
Fed-batch fermentation is a variation of batch fermentation where some of the
ingredients are added during the fermentation. This allows greater control over
the stages of the process. In particular, production of secondary metabolites
can be increased by adding a limited quantity of nutrients during the non-
exponential growth phase. Fed-batch operations are often sandwiched between
batch operations.[26]:1[27]
**** Open[edit] ****
The high cost of sterilizing the fermentor between batches can be avoided using
various open fermentation approaches that are able to resist contamination. One
is to use a naturally evolved mixed culture. This is particularly favored in
wastewater treatment, since mixed populations can adapt to a wide variety of
wastes. Thermophilic bacteria can produce lactic acid at temperatures of around
50 degrees Celsius, sufficient to discourage microbial contamination; and
ethanol has been produced at a temperature of 70 Â°C. This is just below its
boiling point (78 Â°C), making it easy to extract. Halophilic bacteria can
produce bioplastics in hypersaline conditions. Solid-state fermentation adds a
small amount of water to a solid substrate; it is widely used in the food
industry to produce flavors, enzymes and organic acids.[25]
**** Continuous[edit] ****
In continuous fermentation, substrates are added and final products removed
continuously.[25] There are three varieties: chemostats, which hold nutrient
levels constant; turbidostats, which keep cell mass constant; and plug_flow
reactors in which the culture medium flows steadily through a tube while the
cells are recycled from the outlet to the inlet.[27] If the process works well,
there is a steady flow of feed and effluent and the costs of repeatedly setting
up a batch are avoided. Also, it can prolong the exponential growth phase and
avoid byproducts that inhibit the reactions by continuously removing them.
However, it is difficult to maintain a steady state and avoid contamination,
and the design tends to be complex.[25] Typically the fermentor must run for
over 500 hours to be more economical than batch processors.[27]
***** History of the use of fermentation[edit] *****
The use of fermentation, particularly for beverages, has existed since the
Neolithic and has been documented dating from 7000â6600 BCE in Jiahu, China,
[28] 5000 BCE in India, Ayurveda mentions many Medicated Wines, 6000 BCE in
Georgia,[29] 3150 BCE in ancient_Egypt,[30] 3000 BCE in Babylon,[31] 2000 BCE
in pre-Hispanic Mexico,[31] and 1500 BC in Sudan.[32] Fermented foods have a
religious significance in Judaism and Christianity. The Baltic_god Rugutis was
worshiped as the agent of fermentation.[33][34]
Louis Pasteur in his laboratory
In 1837, Charles_Cagniard_de_la_Tour, Theodor_Schwann and Friedrich_Traugott
KÃ¼tzing independently published papers concluding, as a result of microscopic
investigations, that yeast is a living organism that reproduces by budding.[35]
[36]:6 Schwann boiled grape juice to kill the yeast and found that no
fermentation would occur until new yeast was added. However, a lot of chemists,
including Antoine_Lavoisier, continued to view fermentation as a simple
chemical reaction and rejected the notion that living organisms could be
involved. This was seen as a reversion to vitalism and was lampooned in an
anonymous publication by Justus_von_Liebig and Friedrich_WÃ¶hler.[5]:108â109
The turning point came when Louis_Pasteur (1822â1895), during the 1850s and
1860s, repeated Schwann's experiments and showed that fermentation is initiated
by living organisms in a series of investigations.[22][36]:6 In 1857, Pasteur
showed that lactic acid fermentation is caused by living organisms.[37] In
1860, he demonstrated that bacteria cause souring in milk, a process formerly
thought to be merely a chemical change, and his work in identifying the role of
microorganisms in food spoilage led to the process of pasteurization.[38] In
1877, working to improve the French brewing_industry, Pasteur published his
famous paper on fermentation, "Etudes sur la BiÃ¨re", which was translated into
English in 1879 as "Studies on fermentation".[39] He defined fermentation
(incorrectly) as "Life without air",[40] but correctly showed that specific
types of microorganisms cause specific types of fermentations and specific end-
products.
Although showing fermentation to be the result of the action of living
microorganisms was a breakthrough, it did not explain the basic nature of the
fermentation process, or prove that it is caused by the microorganisms that
appear to be always present. Many scientists, including Pasteur, had
unsuccessfully attempted to extract the fermentation enzyme from yeast.[40]
Success came in 1897 when the German chemist Eduard_Buechner ground up yeast,
extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement that this "dead"
liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much
like living yeasts.[41] Buechner's results are considered to mark the birth of
biochemistry. The "unorganized ferments" behaved just like the organized ones.
From that time on, the term enzyme came to be applied to all ferments. It was
then understood that fermentation is caused by enzymes that are produced by
microorganisms.[42] In 1907, Buechner won the Nobel_Prize_in_chemistry for his
work.[43]
Advances in microbiology and fermentation technology have continued steadily up
until the present. For example, in the 1930s, it was discovered that
microorganisms could be mutated with physical and chemical treatments to be
higher-yielding, faster-growing, tolerant of less oxygen, and able to use a
more concentrated medium.[44][45] Strain selection and hybridization developed
as well, affecting most modern food_fermentations.
***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word "ferment" is derived from the Latin verb fervere, which means to boil.
It is thought to have been first used in the late 14th century in alchemy, but
only in a broad sense. It was not used in the modern scientific sense until
around 1600.
