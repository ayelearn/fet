The internal structure of a chloroplast
The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark
reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle[1] of photosynthesis
are the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into
glucose. These reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a
chloroplast outside the thylakoid_membranes. These reactions take the products
(ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent_reactions and perform further chemical
processes on them. There are three phases to the light-independent reactions,
collectively called the Calvin cycle: carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration.
This process occurs only when light is available. Plants do not carry out the
Calvin cycle during nighttime. They instead release sucrose into the phloem
from their starch reserves to provide energy for the plant. This process
happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis (C3
carbon_fixation, C4_carbon_fixation, and Crassulacean_Acid_Metabolism_(CAM));
CAM plants store malic_acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day
to make this process work.[2]

***** Coupling to other metabolic pathways [edit] *****
These reactions are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain
as the energy required to reduce the carbon dioxide is provided by NADPH
produced in photosystem_I during the light_dependent_reactions. The process of
photorespiration, also known as C2 cycle, is also coupled to the calvin cycle,
as it results from an alternative reaction of the RuBisCO enzyme, and its final
byproduct is another glyceraldehyde-3-P.
***** Calvin cycle[edit] *****
Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon_fixation
The Calvin cycle, CalvinâBensonâBassham (CBB) cycle, reductive pentose
phosphate cycle or C3 cycle is a series of biochemical redox reactions that
take place in the stroma of chloroplast in photosynthetic organisms.
The cycle was discovered by Melvin_Calvin, James_Bassham, and Andrew_Benson at
the University_of_California,_Berkeley[3] by using the radioactive isotope
carbon-14.
Photosynthesis occurs in two stages in a cell. In the first stage, light-
dependent reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-
storage and transport molecules ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle uses the energy
from short-lived electronically excited carriers to convert carbon_dioxide and
water into organic_compounds[4] that can be used by the organism (and by
animals that feed on it). This set of reactions is also called carbon fixation.
The key enzyme of the cycle is called RuBisCO. In the following biochemical
equations, the chemical species (phosphates and carboxylic acids) exist in
equilibria among their various ionized states as governed by the pH.
The enzymes in the Calvin cycle are functionally equivalent to most enzymes
used in other metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis and the pentose
phosphate_pathway, but they are found in the chloroplast stroma instead of the
cell cytosol, separating the reactions. They are activated in the light (which
is why the name "dark reaction" is misleading), and also by products of the
light-dependent reaction. These regulatory functions prevent the Calvin cycle
from being respired to carbon dioxide. Energy (in the form of ATP) would be
wasted in carrying out these reactions that have no net_productivity.
The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following:
      3 CO
      2 + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ + 9 ATP â glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) + 6 NADP+
      + 9 ADP + 3 H
      2O + 8 Pi   (Pi = inorganic phosphate)
Hexose (six-carbon) sugars are not a product of the Calvin cycle. Although many
texts list a product of photosynthesis as C
6H
12O
6, this is mainly a convenience to counter the equation of respiration, where
six-carbon sugars are oxidized in mitochondria. The carbohydrate products of
the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or "triose
phosphates", namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).
**** Steps[edit] ****
In the first stage of the Calvin cycle, a CO
2 molecule is incorporated into one of two three-carbon molecules
(glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate or G3P), where it uses up two molecules of ATP and
two molecules of NADPH, which had been produced in the light-dependent stage.
The three steps involved are:
Calvin cycle step 1 (black circles represent carbon atoms)
Calvin cycle steps 2 and 3 combined
   1. The enzyme RuBisCO catalyses the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-
      bisphosphate, RuBP, a 5-carbon compound, by carbon dioxide (a total of 6
      carbons) in a two-step reaction.[5] The product of the first step is
      enediol-enzyme complex that can capture CO
      2 or O
      2. Thus, enediol-enzyme complex is the real carboxylase/oxygenase. The CO
      2 that is captured by enediol in second step produces an unstable six-
      carbon compound called 2-carboxy 3-keto 1,5-biphosphoribotol (or 3-keto-
      2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate) that immediately splits into 2
      molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, or 3-PGA, a 3-carbon compound[6] (also:
      3-phosphoglyceric acid, PGA, 3PGA).
   2. The enzyme phosphoglycerate_kinase catalyses the phosphorylation of 3-PGA
      by ATP (which was produced in the light-dependent stage). 1,3-
      Bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPGA, glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate) and ADP are the
      products. (However, note that two 3-PGAs are produced for every CO
      2 that enters the cycle, so this step utilizes two ATP per CO
      2 fixed.)
   3. The enzyme glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate_dehydrogenase catalyses the
      reduction of 1,3BPGA by NADPH (which is another product of the light-
      dependent stage). Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate (also called G3P, GP, TP,
      PGAL, GAP) is produced, and the NADPH itself is oxidized and becomes
      NADP+. Again, two NADPH are utilized per CO
      2 fixed.
Regeneration stage of the Calvin cycle
The next stage in the Calvin cycle is to regenerate RuBP. Five G3P molecules
produce three RuBP molecules, using up three molecules of ATP. Since each CO
2 molecule produces two G3P molecules, three CO
2 molecules produce six G3P molecules, of which five are used to regenerate
RuBP, leaving a net gain of one G3P molecule per three CO
2 molecules (as would be expected from the number of carbon atoms involved).
Simplified C3 cycle with structural formulas
The regeneration stage can be broken down into steps.
   1. Triose_phosphate_isomerase converts all of the G3P reversibly into
      dihydroxyacetone_phosphate (DHAP), also a 3-carbon molecule.
   2. Aldolase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase convert a G3P and a DHAP into
      fructose_6-phosphate (6C). A phosphate ion is lost into solution.
   3. Then fixation of another CO
      2 generates two more G3P.
   4. F6P has two carbons removed by transketolase, giving erythrose-4-
      phosphate. The two carbons on transketolase are added to a G3P, giving
      the ketose xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P).
   5. E4P and a DHAP (formed from one of the G3P from the second CO
      2 fixation) are converted into sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (7C) by
      aldolase enzyme.
   6. Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (one of only three enzymes of the Calvin
      cycle that are unique to plants) cleaves sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate
      into sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, releasing an inorganic phosphate ion into
      solution.
   7. Fixation of a third CO
      2 generates two more G3P. The ketose S7P has two carbons removed by
      transketolase, giving ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), and the two carbons
      remaining on transketolase are transferred to one of the G3P, giving
      another Xu5P. This leaves one G3P as the product of fixation of 3 CO
      2, with generation of three pentoses that can be converted to Ru5P.
   8. R5P is converted into ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P, RuP) by phosphopentose
      isomerase. Xu5P is converted into RuP by phosphopentose_epimerase.
   9. Finally, phosphoribulokinase (another plant-unique enzyme of the pathway)
      phosphorylates RuP into RuBP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, completing the
      Calvin cycle. This requires the input of one ATP.
Thus, of six G3P produced, five are used to make three RuBP (5C) molecules
(totaling 15 carbons), with only one G3P available for subsequent conversion to
hexose. This requires nine ATP molecules and six NADPH molecules per three CO
2 molecules. The equation of the overall Calvin cycle is shown diagrammatically
below.
The overall equation of the Calvin cycle (black circles represent carbon atoms)
RuBisCO also reacts competitively with O
2 instead of CO
2 in photorespiration. The rate of photorespiration is higher at high
temperatures. Photorespiration turns RuBP into 3-PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate, a
2-carbon molecule that can be converted via glycolate and glyoxalate to
glycine. Via the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate, two glycines are
converted into serine +CO
2. Serine can be converted back to 3-phosphoglycerate. Thus, only 3 of 4
carbons from two phosphoglycolates can be converted back to 3-PGA. It can be
seen that photorespiration has very negative consequences for the plant,
because, rather than fixing CO
2, this process leads to loss of CO
2. C4_carbon_fixation evolved to circumvent photorespiration, but can occur
only in certain plants native to very warm or tropical climatesâcorn, for
example.
**** Products[edit] ****
The immediate products of one turn of the Calvin cycle are 2 glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate (G3P) molecules, 3 ADP, and 2 NADP+. (ADP and NADP+ are not really
"products." They are regenerated and later used again in the Light-dependent
reactions). Each G3P molecule is composed of 3 carbons. For the Calvin cycle to
continue, RuBP (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) must be regenerated. So, 5 out of 6
carbons from the 2 G3P molecules are used for this purpose. Therefore, there is
only 1 net carbon produced to play with for each turn. To create 1 surplus G3P
requires 3 carbons, and therefore 3 turns of the Calvin cycle. To make one
glucose molecule (which can be created from 2 G3P molecules) would require 6
turns of the Calvin cycle. Surplus G3P can also be used to form other
carbohydrates such as starch, sucrose, and cellulose, depending on what the
plant needs.[7]
***** Light-dependent regulation[edit] *****
Main article: Light-dependent_reactions
These reactions do not occur in the dark or at night. There is a light-
dependent regulation of the cycle enzymes, as the third step requires reduced
NADP.
There are two regulation systems at work when the cycle must be turned on or
off: the thioredoxin/ferredoxin activation system, which activates some of the
cycle enzymes; and the RuBisCo enzyme activation, active in the Calvin cycle,
which involves its own activase.
The thioredoxin/ferredoxin system activates the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-
P dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-P phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase,
sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, and ribulose-5-phosphatase kinase, which are
key points of the process. This happens when light is available, as the
ferredoxin protein is reduced in the photosystem_I complex of the thylakoid
electron chain when electrons are circulating through it.[8] Ferredoxin then
binds to and reduces the thioredoxin protein, which activates the cycle enzymes
by severing a cystine bond found in all these enzymes. This is a dynamic
process as the same bond is formed again by other proteins that deactivate the
enzymes. The implications of this process are that the enzymes remain mostly
activated by day and are deactivated in the dark when there is no more reduced
ferredoxin available.
The enzyme RuBisCo has its own, more complex activation process. It requires
that a specific lysine amino acid be carbamylated to activate the enzyme. This
lysine binds to RuBP and leads to a non-functional state if left
uncarbamylated. A specific activase enzyme, called RuBisCo_activase, helps this
carbamylation process by removing one proton from the lysine and making the
binding of the carbon dioxide molecule possible. Even then the RuBisCo enzyme
is not yet functional, as it needs a magnesium ion bound to the lysine to
function. This magnesium ion is released from the thylakoid lumen when the
inner pH drops due to the active pumping of protons from the electron flow.
RuBisCo activase itself is activated by increased concentrations of ATP in the
stroma caused by its phosphorylation.
