Tea plant
Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water
over cured leaves of the Camellia_sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush) native to
East_Asia.[3] After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.
[4] There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese
greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[5] while
others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or
grassy notes.
Tea originated in Southwest_China during the Shang_dynasty, where it was used
as a medicinal_drink.[6] An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the
3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua_Tuo.[7] It was popularized as
a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang_dynasty, and tea drinking spread
to other East Asian countries. Portuguese_priests and merchants introduced it
to Europe during the 16th century.[8] During the 17th century, drinking tea
became fashionable among Britons, who started large-scale production and
commercialization of the plant in India. Combined, China and India supplied 62%
of the world's tea in 2016.
The term herbal_tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis: infusions
of fruit, leaves, or other_parts_of_the_plant, such as steeps of rosehip,
chamomile, or rooibos. These are sometimes[9] called tisanes or herbal
infusions to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant.

***** Etymology *****
Main article: Etymology_of_tea
The Chinese_character for tea is è¶, originally written with an extra stroke
as è¼ (pronounced tÃº, used as a word for a bitter herb), and acquired its
current form during the Tang_Dynasty.[10][11][12] The word is pronounced
differently in the different varieties_of_Chinese, such as chÃ¡ in Mandarin, zo
and dzo in Wu_Chinese, and ta and te in Min_Chinese.[13] One suggestion is that
the different pronunciations may have arisen from the different words for tea
in ancient China, for example tÃº (è¼) may have given rise to tÃª;[14]
historical phonologists however argued that the cha, te and dzo all arose from
the same root with a reconstructed pronunciation dra, which changed due to
sound shift through the centuries.[15] There were other ancient words for tea,
though ming (è) is the only other one still in common use.[15][16] It has
been proposed that the Chinese words for tea, tu, cha and ming, may have been
borrowed from the Austro-Asiatic_languages of people who inhabited southwest
China; cha for example may have been derived from an archaic Austro-Asiatic
root *la, meaning "leaf".[17]
Tea plantation in Assam, India
The few exceptions of words for tea that do not fall into the three broad
groups of te, cha and chai are the minor languages from the botanical homeland
of the tea plant: northeast Burma and southwest Yunnan. Examples are la
(meaning tea purchased elsewhere) and miiem (wild tea gathered in the hills)
from the Wa_people, letpet in Burmese and meng in Lamet meaning "fermented tea
leaves", as well as miang in Thai ("fermented tea").
Most Chinese languages, such as Mandarin and Cantonese, pronounce it along the
lines of cha, but Hokkien and Teochew Chinese varieties along the Southern
coast of China pronounce it like teh. These two pronunciations have made their
separate ways into other languages around the world.[18]
Starting in the early 17th century, the Dutch played a dominant role in the
early European tea trade via the Dutch_East_India_Company.[19] The Dutch
borrowed the word for "tea" (thee) from Min_Chinese, either through trade
directly from Hokkien speakers in Formosa where they had established a port, or
from Malay traders in Bantam, Java.[20] The Dutch then introduced to other
European languages this Min pronunciation for tea, including English tea,
French thÃ©, Spanish tÃ©, and German Tee.[21] This pronunciation is also the
most common form worldwide.[22] The Cha pronunciation came from the Cantonese
chÃ h of Guangzhou (Canton) and the ports of Hong_Kong and Macau, which were
also major points of contact, especially with the Portuguese traders who
settled Macau in the 16th century. The Portuguese adopted the Cantonese
pronunciation "chÃ¡", and spread it to India.[20] However, the Korean and
Japanese pronunciations of cha were not from Cantonese, but were borrowed into
Korean and Japanese during earlier periods of Chinese history.
A third form, the increasingly widespread chai, came from Persian ÚØ§Û
[tÊÉËi] chay. Both the chÃ¢ and chÃ¢y forms are found in Persian
dictionaries.[23] They are derived from the Northern Chinese pronunciation of
chÃ¡,[24] which passed overland to Central Asia and Persia, where it picked up
the Persian grammatical suffix -yi before passing on to Russian as ÑÐ°Ð¹ (
[tÉÃ¦j], chay), Arabic as Ø´Ø§Ù (pronounced shay [ÊÃ¦iË] due to the lack of
a /tÍ¡Ê/ sound in Arabic), Urdu as ÚØ§Ø¦Û chay, Hindi as à¤à¤¾à¤¯ chÄy,
Turkish as Ã§ay, etc.[25] The few exceptions of words for tea that do not fall
into the three broad groups of te, cha and chai are mostly from the minor
languages from the botanical homeland of the tea plant from which the Chinese
words for tea might have been borrowed originally.[15] English has all three
forms: cha or char (both pronounced /tÊÉË/), attested from the 16th century;
tea, from the 17th; and chai, from the 20th. However, the form chai refers
specifically to a black tea mixed with sugar or honey, spices and milk in
contemporary English.[26]
***** Origin and history *****
Further information: History_of_tea
A 19th-century Japanese painting depicting Shennong: Chinese legends credit
Shennong with the invention of tea.[27]
Tea plants are native to East Asia, and probably originated in the borderlands
of north Burma and southwestern China.[28]
    * Chinese (small leaf) tea
    * Chinese Western Yunnan Assam (large leaf) tea
          o Indian Assam (large leaf) tea
    * Chinese Southern Yunnan Assam (large leaf) tea
Chinese (small leaf) type tea (C. sinensis var. sinensis) may have originated
in southern China possibly with hybridization of unknown wild tea relatives.
However, since there are no known wild populations of this tea, the precise
location of its origin is speculative.[29][30]
Given their genetic differences forming distinct clades, Chinese Assam type tea
(C. sinensis var. assamica) may have two different parentages â one being
found in southern Yunnan (Xishuangbanna, Pu'er_City) and the other in western
Yunnan (Lincang, Baoshan). Many types of Southern Yunnan assam tea have been
hybridized with the closely related species Camellia_taliensis. Unlike Southern
Yunnan Assam tea, Western Yunnan Assam tea shares many genetic similarities
with Indian Assam type tea (also C. sinensis var. assamica). Thus, Western
Yunnan Assam tea and Indian Assam tea both may have originated from the same
parent plant in the area where southwestern China, Indo-Burma, and Tibet meet.
However, as the Indian Assam tea shares no haplotypes with Western Yunnan Assam
tea, Indian Assam tea is likely to have originated from an independent
domestication. Some Indian Assam tea appears to have hybridized with the
species Camellia_pubicosta.[29][30]
Assuming a generation of 12 years, Chinese small leaf tea is estimated to have
diverged from Assam tea around 22,000 years ago while Chinese Assam tea and
Indian Assam tea diverged 2,800 years ago. The divergence of Chinese small leaf
tea and Assam tea would correspond to the last glacial_maximum.[29][30]
Tea drinking may have begun in the region of Yunnan region, when it was used
for medicinal purposes. It is also believed that in Sichuan, "people began to
boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition
of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink,
rather than as a medicinal concoction."[6]
Chinese legends attribute the invention of tea to the mythical Shennong (in
central and northern China) in 2737 BC although evidence suggests that tea
drinking may have been introduced from the southwest of China (Sichuan/Yunnan
area).[27] The earliest written records of tea come from China. The word tÃº
è¼ appears in the Shijing and other ancient texts to signify a kind of "bitter
vegetable" (è¦è), and it is possible that it referred to many different
plants such as sowthistle, chicory, or smartweed,[31] as well as tea.[15] In
the Chronicles_of_Huayang, it was recorded that the Ba people in Sichuan
presented tu to the Zhou king. The Qin later conquered the state of Ba and its
neighbour Shu, and according to the 17th century scholar Gu_Yanwu who wrote in
Ri Zhi Lu (æ¥ç¥é): "It was after the Qin had taken Shu that they learned
how to drink tea."[2] Another possible early reference to tea is found in a
letter written by the Qin Dynasty general Liu Kun who requested that some "real
tea" to be sent to him.[32]
The earliest known physical evidence[33] of tea was discovered in 2016 in the
mausoleum of Emperor_Jing_of_Han in Xi'an, indicating that tea from the genus
Camellia was drunk by Han_Dynasty emperors as early as the 2nd century BC.[34]
The Han dynasty work, "The Contract for a Youth", written by Wang_Bao in 59 BC,
[35] contains the first known reference to boiling tea. Among the tasks listed
to be undertaken by the youth, the contract states that "he shall boil tea and
fill the utensils" and "he shall buy tea at Wuyang".[2] The first record of tea
cultivation is also dated to this period (the reign of Emperor_Xuan_of_Han),
during which tea was cultivated on Meng Mountain (èå±±) near Chengdu.[36]
Another early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in
a medical text by Hua_Tuo, who stated, "to drink bitter t'u constantly makes
one think better."[37] However, before the mid-8th century Tang dynasty, tea-
drinking was primarily a southern Chinese practice.[38] It became widely
popular during the Tang_Dynasty, when it was spread to Korea, Japan, and
Vietnam.
Through the centuries, a variety of techniques for processing tea, and a number
of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was
steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form,[39] while in the Song_dynasty,
loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the Yuan and Ming
dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried, a
process that stops the oxidation process that turns the leaves dark, thereby
allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, in which the
leaves were allowed to partially oxidize before pan-frying, was developed.[38]
Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized black_tea, and the leaves
were allowed to oxidize further. Yellow_tea was an accidental discovery in the
production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently sloppy
practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, but yielded a different flavour as
a result.[40]

Tea was first introduced to Portuguese priests and merchants in China during
the 16th century, at which time it was termed chÃ¡.[8] The earliest European
reference to tea, written as Chiai, came from Delle navigationi e viaggi
written by a Venetian, Giambattista_Ramusio, in 1545.[41] The first recorded
shipment of tea by a European nation was in 1607 when the Dutch_East_India
Company moved a cargo of tea from Macao to Java, then two years later, the
Dutch bought the first assignment of tea which was from Hirado in Japan to be
shipped to Europe.[42] Tea became a fashionable drink in The_Hague in the
Netherlands, and the Dutch introduced the drink to Germany, France and across
the Atlantic to New_Amsterdam (New York).[43]
The first record of tea in English came from a letter written by Richard
Wickham, who ran an East_India_Company office in Japan, writing to a merchant
in Macao requesting "the best sort of chaw" in 1615. Peter_Mundy, a traveller
and merchant who came across tea in Fujian in 1637, wrote, "chaa â only water
with a kind of herb boyled in it ".[44][45] Tea was sold in a coffee house in
London in 1657, Samuel_Pepys tasted tea in 1660, and Catherine_of_Braganza took
the tea-drinking habit to the British court when she married Charles_II in
1662. Tea, however, was not widely consumed in Britain until the 18th century,
and remained expensive until the latter part of that period. British drinkers
preferred to add sugar and milk to black tea, and black tea overtook green_tea
in popularity in the 1720s.[46] Tea smuggling during the 18th century led to
the general public being able to afford and consume tea. The British government
removed the tax on tea, thereby eliminating the smuggling trade by 1785.[47] In
Britain and Ireland, tea was initially consumed as a luxury item on special
occasions, such as religious festivals, wakes, and domestic work gatherings.
The price of tea in Europe fell steadily during the 19th century, especially
after Indian tea began to arrive in large quantities; by the late 19th century
tea had become an everyday beverage for all levels of society.[48] The
popularity of tea also informed a number of historical events â the Tea_Act
of_1773 provoked the Boston_Tea_Party that escalated into the American
Revolution. The need to address the issue of British trade deficit caused by
the Manchu Emperor Kangxi who proclaimed that âChina was the center of the
world, possessing everything they could ever want or need and banned foreign
products from being sold in China!â He also decreed in 1685 âThat all goods
bought from China must be paid for in Silver Coin or Bullion.â This caused
all other Nation's Traders to find some other product, opium, to sell to China
to earn back the silver they were required to paid for tea, jade and silk.
Later, Chinese Government attempts to curtail the trade in opium with out
relaxing trade restrictions on foreign goods, resulted in the Opium_Wars.[49]
Chinese small leaf type tea was introduced into India in 1836 by the British in
an attempt to break the Chinese monopoly on tea.[50] In 1841, Archibald
Campbell brought seeds of Chinese tea from the Kumaun region and experimented
with planting tea in Darjeeling. The Alubari tea garden was opened in 1856 and
Darjeeling_tea began to be produced.[51] In 1848, Robert_Fortune was sent by
the East India Company on a mission to China to bring the tea plant back to
Great Britain. He began his journey in high secrecy as his mission occurred in
the lull between the Anglo-Chinese First_Opium_War (1839â1842) and Second
Opium_War (1856â1860).[52] The Chinese tea plants he brought back were
introduced to the Himalayas, though most did not survive. The British had
discovered that a different variety of tea was endemic to Assam and the
northeast region of India and that it was used by the local Singpho_people, and
these were then grown instead of the Chinese tea plant and then were
subsequently hybridized with Chinese small leaf type tea as well as likely
closely related wild tea species. Using the Chinese planting and cultivation
techniques, the British launched a tea industry by offering land in Assam to
any European who agreed to cultivate it for export.[50] Tea was originally
consumed only by anglicized Indians; however, it became widely popular in India
in the 1950s because of a successful advertising campaign by the India Tea
Board.[50]
***** Cultivation and harvesting *****
Tea plantation workers in Sri_Lanka
Camellia_sinensis is an evergreen plant that grows mainly in tropical and
subtropical climates.[53] Some varieties can also tolerate marine_climates and
are cultivated as far north as Cornwall in England,[54] Perthshire in Scotland,
[55] Washington state in the United States,[56] and Vancouver_Island in Canada.
[57] In the Southern Hemisphere, tea is grown as far south as Hobart on the
Australian island of Tasmania[58][59] and Waikato in New Zealand.[60]
Tea plants are propagated from seed and cuttings; about 4 to 12 years are
needed for a plant to bear seed and about three years before a new plant is
ready for harvesting.[53] In addition to a zone_8 climate or warmer, tea plants
require at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall a year and prefer acidic_soils.[61]
Many high-quality tea plants are cultivated at elevations of up to 1,500 m
(4,900 ft) above sea level. Though at these heights the plants grow more
slowly, they acquire a better flavour.[62]
Two principal varieties are used: Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, which is
used for most Chinese, Formosan and Japanese teas, and C. sinensis var.
assamica, used in Pu-erh and most Indian teas (but not Darjeeling). Within
these botanical varieties, many strains and modern clonal varieties are known.
Leaf size is the chief criterion for the classification of tea plants, with
three primary classifications being,[63] Assam type, characterised by the
largest leaves; China type, characterised by the smallest leaves; and Cambodian
type, characterised by leaves of intermediate size. The Cambod type tea (C.
assamica subsp. lasiocaly) was originally considered a type of assam tea.
However, later genetic work showed that it is a hybrid between Chinese small
leaf tea and assam type tea.[64] Darjeeling tea also appears to be hybrids
between Chinese small leaf tea and assam type tea.[65]
A tea plant will grow into a tree of up to 16 m (52 ft) if left undisturbed,
[53] but cultivated plants are generally pruned to waist height for ease of
plucking. Also, the short plants bear more new shoots which provide new and
tender leaves and increase the quality of the tea.[66]
Only the top 1â2 inches (2.5â5.1 cm) of the mature plant are picked. These
buds and leaves are called 'flushes'.[67] A plant will grow a new flush every
seven to 15 days during the growing season. Leaves that are slow in development
tend to produce better-flavoured teas.[53]
Pests of tea include mosquito bugs of the genus Helopeltis (which are true_bugs
that must not be confused with the_dipteran) that can tatter leaves, so they
may be sprayed with insecticides. In addition, there may be Lepidopteran leaf
feeders and various tea_diseases.
***** Chemical composition *****
See also: Phenolic_content_in_tea and Health_effects_of_tea
Physically speaking, tea has properties of both a solution and a suspension. It
is a solution of all the water-soluble compounds that have been extracted from
the tea leaves, such as the polyphenols and amino acids, but is a suspension
when all of the insoluble components are considered, such as the cellulose in
the tea leaves.[68]
Caffeine constitutes about 3% of tea's dry weight, translating to between 30
milligrams (0.0011 oz) and 90 milligrams (0.0032 oz) per 8-oz (250-ml) cup
depending on the type, brand,[69] and brewing method.[70] A study found that
the caffeine content of 1 gram (0.035 oz) of black tea ranged from 22â28
milligrams (0.00078â0.00099 oz), while the caffeine content of 1 gram
(0.035 oz) of green tea ranged from 11â20 milligrams (0.00039â0.00071 oz),
reflecting a significant difference.[71] Tea also contains small amounts of
theobromine and theophylline, which are stimulants, and xanthines similar to
caffeine.[72]
Fresh tea leaves in various stages of growth.
Black and green_teas contain no essential_nutrients in significant amounts,
with the exception of the dietary_mineral, manganese at 0.5 milligrams
(1.8Ã10â5 oz) per cup or 26% of the Daily_Value.[73] Because of modern
environmental pollution, fluoride sometimes occur in tea. Certain types of
brick_tea made from old leaves and stems have the highest levels.[74]
The astringency in tea can be attributed to the presence of polyphenols. These
are the most abundant compounds in tea leaves, making up 30â40% of their
composition.[75] Polyphenols include flavonoids, epigallocatechin_gallate
(EGCG), and other catechins.[76][77]
It has been suggested that green and black tea may protect against cancer[78]
or other diseases such as obesity[79] or Alzheimer's_disease,[80] but the
compounds found in green tea have not been conclusively demonstrated to have
any effect on human diseases.[81][82]
***** Processing and classification *****
Main article: Tea_processing
Teas of different levels of oxidation (L to R): green, yellow, oolong, and
black
Tea is generally divided into categories based on how it is processed.[83] At
least six different types are produced:
    * White: wilted and unoxidized;
    * Yellow: unwilted and unoxidized but allowed to yellow;
    * Green: unwilted and unoxidized;
    * Oolong: wilted, bruised, and partially oxidized;
    * Black: wilted, sometimes crushed, and fully oxidized (called ç´è¶
      [hÃ³ngchÃ¡], "red tea" in Chinese tea culture);
    * Post-fermented: green tea that has been allowed to ferment/compost
      (called é»è¶ [hÄichÃ¡] "black tea" in Chinese tea culture).
After picking, the leaves of C. sinensis soon begin to wilt and oxidize unless
immediately dried. An enzymatic_oxidation process triggered by the plant's
intracellular enzymes causes the leaves to turn progressively darker as their
chlorophyll breaks down and tannins are released. This darkening is stopped at
a predetermined stage by heating, which deactivates the enzymes responsible. In
the production of black teas, halting by heating is carried out simultaneously
with drying. Without careful moisture and temperature control during
manufacture and packaging, growth of undesired molds and bacteria may make tea
unfit for consumption.
**** Additional processing and additives ****
Further information: Tea_blending_and_additives
Common processing methods of tea leaves
After basic processing, teas may be altered through additional processing steps
before being sold,[84] and is often consumed with additions to the basic tea
leaf and water added during preparation or drinking. Examples of additional
processing steps that occur before tea is sold are blending, flavouring,
scenting, and decaffeination of teas. Examples of additions added at the point
of consumption include milk, sugar and lemon.
*** Blending ***
Tea blending is the combination of different teas together to achieve the final
product. Almost all tea in bags and most loose tea sold in the West is blended.
[citation_needed] Such teas may combine others from the same cultivation area
or several different ones. The aim is to obtain consistency, better taste,
higher price, or some combination of the three.
*** Flavouring ***
Flavoured and scented teas add new aromas and flavours to the base tea. This
can be accomplished through directly adding flavouring agents, such as ginger
or dried ginger, cloves, mint_leaves, cardamom, bergamot (found in Earl_Grey),
vanilla, and spearmint. Alternatively, because tea easily retains odours, it
can be placed in proximity to an aromatic ingredient to absorb its aroma, as in
traditional jasmine_tea.[85][unreliable_source?]
*** Milk ***
Black tea is often taken with milk
The addition of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the
epistolist Madame_de_SÃ©vignÃ©.[86] Many teas are traditionally drunk with milk
in cultures where dairy products are consumed. These include Indian masala_chai
and British tea blends. These teas tend to be very hearty varieties of black
tea which can be tasted through the milk, such as Assams, or the East Friesian
blend. Milk is thought to neutralise remaining tannins and reduce acidity.[87]
[88] The Han_Chinese do not usually drink milk with tea but the Manchus do, and
the elite of the Qing_Dynasty of the Chinese Empire continued to do so. Hong
Kong-style_milk_tea is based on British colonial habits. Tibetans and other
Himalayan peoples traditionally drink tea with milk or yak_butter and salt. In
Eastern European countries (Russia, Poland and Hungary) and in Italy, tea is
commonly served with lemon juice. In Poland, tea with milk is called a bawarka
("Bavarian style"), and is often drunk by pregnant and nursing women. In
Australia, tea with milk is white tea.
The order of steps in preparing a cup of tea is a much-debated topic, and can
vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some say it is preferable to
add the milk before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can
denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of
UHT_milk, resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage.[89] Others insist it is
better to add the milk after brewing the tea, as black tea is often brewed as
close to boiling as possible.[clarify] The addition of milk chills the beverage
during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot,
meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By
adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also
to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be
observed.[citation_needed] Historically, the order of steps was taken as an
indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain
would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling
water unadulterated with milk.[90] Higher temperature difference means faster
heat_transfer, so the earlier milk is added, the slower the drink cools. A 2007
study published in the European Heart Journal found certain beneficial_effects
of_tea may be lost through the addition of milk.[91]

**** Black tea ****
Main article: Black_tea
Popular varieties of black_tea include Assam, Nepal, Darjeeling, Nilgiri, Rize,
Keemun, and Ceylon teas.
Many of the active substances in black tea do not develop at temperatures lower
than 90 Â°C (194 Â°F).[92] As a result, black tea in the West is usually
steeped in water near its boiling point, at around 99 Â°C (210 Â°F). Since
boiling point drops with increasing altitude, it is difficult to brew black tea
properly in mountainous areas.
Western black teas are usually brewed for about four minutes. In many regions
of the world, however, actively boiling water is used and the tea is often
stewed. In India, black tea is often boiled for fifteen minutes or longer to
make Masala_chai, as a strong brew is preferred. Tea is often strained while
serving.
A food safety management group of the International_Organization_for
Standardization (ISO) has published a standard for preparing a cup of tea (ISO
3103: Tea â Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests), primarily
intended for standardizing preparation for comparison and rating purposes.
**** Green tea ****
Main article: Green_tea
In regions of the world that prefer mild beverages, such as the Far East, green
tea is steeped in water around 80 to 85 Â°C (176 to 185 Â°F). Regions such as
North Africa or Central Asia prefer a bitter tea, and hotter water is used. In
Morocco, green tea is steeped in boiling water for 15 minutes.
The container in which green tea is steeped is often warmed beforehand to
prevent premature cooling. High-quality green and white teas can have new water
added as many as five or more times, depending on variety, at increasingly
higher temperatures.
**** Oolong tea ****
Main article: Oolong
Oolong tea is brewed around 82 to 96 Â°C (185 to 205 Â°F), with the brewing
vessel warmed before pouring the water. Yixing_purple_clay teapots are the
traditional brewing-vessel for oolong tea which can be brewed multiple times
from the same leaves, unlike green tea, seeming to improve with reuse. In the
southern Chinese and Taiwanese Gongfu_tea_ceremony, the first brew is
discarded, as it is considered a rinse of leaves rather than a proper brew.
**** Pu-erh tea ****
Main article: Pu'er_tea
Pu-erh teas require boiling water for infusion. Some prefer to quickly rinse
pu-erh for several seconds with boiling water to remove tea dust which
accumulates from the ageing process, then infuse it at the boiling point
(100 Â°C or 212 Â°F), and allow it to steep from 30 seconds to five minutes.
**** Masala chai ****
Main article: Masala_chai
Meaning "spiced tea", masala chai tea is prepared using black or green tea with
milk (in which case it may be called a "latte"), and may be spiced with ginger.
[93]
**** Cold brew tea ****
See also: Cold_brew_tea and Iced_tea
While most tea is prepared using hot water, it is also possible to brew a
beverage from tea using room temperature or cooled water. This requires longer
steeping time to extract the key components, and produces a different flavour
profile. Cold brews use about 1.5 times the tea leaves that would be used for
hot steeping, and are refrigerated for 4â10 hours. The process of making cold
brew tea is much simpler than that for cold_brew_coffee.
Cold brewing has some disadvantages compared to hot steeping. If the leaves or
source water contain unwanted bacteria, they may flourish, whereas using hot
water has the benefit of killing most bacteria. This is less of a concern in
modern times and developed regions. Cold brewing may also allow for less
caffeine to be extracted.
**** Pouring from height ****
The flavour of tea can also be altered by pouring it from different heights,
resulting in varying degrees of aeration.[94] The art of elevated pouring is
used principally to enhance the flavour of the tea, while cooling the beverage
for immediate consumption.[94]
In Southeast_Asia, the practice of pouring tea from a height has been refined
further using black tea to which condensed milk is added, poured from a height
from one cup to another several times in alternating fashion and in quick
succession, to create a tea with entrapped air bubbles, creating a frothy
"head" in the cup. This beverage, teh_tarik, literally, "pulled tea" (which has
its origin as a hot Indian tea beverage), has a creamier taste than flat milk
tea and is common in the region.
***** Tea culture *****

Tea may be consumed early in the day to heighten calm alertness[citation
needed]; it contains L-theanine, theophylline, and bound caffeine[5] (sometimes
called theine). Decaffeinated brands are also sold. While herbal teas are also
referred to as tea, most of them do not contain leaves from the tea plant.
While tea is the second most consumed beverage on Earth after water, in many
cultures it is also consumed at elevated social events, such as the tea_party.
Tea_ceremonies have arisen in different cultures, such as the Chinese and
Japanese traditions, each of which employs certain techniques and ritualised
protocol of brewing and serving tea for enjoyment in a refined setting. One
form of Chinese tea ceremony is the Gongfu_tea_ceremony, which typically uses
small Yixing_clay_teapots and oolong_tea.
In_the_United_Kingdom 63% of people drink tea daily[95] and is perceived as one
of Britain's cultural beverages. It is customary for a host to offer tea to
guests soon after their arrival. Tea is consumed both at home and outside the
home, often in cafÃ©s or tea_rooms. Afternoon_tea with cakes on fine porcelain
is a cultural stereotype. In southwest England, many cafÃ©s serve a cream_tea,
consisting of scones, clotted_cream, and jam alongside a pot of tea. In some
parts of Britain and India 'tea'_may_also_refer_to_the_evening_meal.
Ireland has long been one of the biggest per capita consumers of tea in the
world. The national average is four cups per person per day, with many people
drinking six cups or more. Tea in Ireland is usually taken with milk or sugar
and is slightly spicier and stronger than the traditional English blend.
[citation_needed]
Tea is prevalent in most cultures in the Middle East. In Arab_culture, tea is a
focal point for social gatherings.[citation_needed]
Turkish_tea is an important part of that_country's_cuisine, and is the most
commonly consumed hot drink, despite the country's long history of coffee
consumption. In 2004 Turkey produced 205,500 tonnes of tea (6.4% of the world's
total tea production), which made it one of the largest tea markets in the
world,[96] with 120,000 tons being consumed in Turkey, and the rest being
exported.[97] In 2010 Turkey had the highest per capita consumption in the
world at 2.7 kg.[98] As of 2013, the per-capita consumption of Turkish_tea
exceeds 10 cups per day and 13.8 kg per year.[99] Tea is grown mostly in Rize
Province on the Black Sea coast.[100]
In Iranian_culture, tea is so widely consumed, it is generally the first thing
offered to a household guest.[101]
Russia_has_a_long,_rich_tea_history dating to 1638 when tea was introduced to
Tsar_Michael. Social gatherings were considered incomplete without tea, which
was traditionally brewed in a samovar, and today 82% of Russians consume tea
daily[citation_needed].
In Pakistan, both black and green teas are popular and are known locally as
sabz chai and kahwah, respectively. The popular green tea called kahwah is
often served after every meal in the Pashtun belt of Balochistan and in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, which is where the Khyber_Pass is found. In central and southern
Punjab and the metropolitan Sindh region of Pakistan, tea with milk and sugar
(sometimes with pistachios, cardamom, etc.), commonly referred to as chai, is
widely consumed. It is the most common beverage of households in the region. In
the northern Pakistani regions of Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan, a salty,
buttered Tibetan-style_tea is consumed.
In the transnational Kashmir region, which straddles the border between India
and Pakistan, Kashmiri chai or noon_chai, a pink, creamy tea with pistachios,
almonds, cardamom, and sometimes cinnamon, is consumed primarily at special
occasions, weddings, and during the winter months when it is sold in many
kiosks.
Indian_tea
Indian_tea_culture is strong â the drink is the most popular hot beverage in
the country. It is consumed daily[citation_needed] in almost all houses,
offered to guests, consumed in high amounts in domestic and official
surroundings, and is made with the addition of milk with or without spices, and
usually sweetened. At homes it is sometimes served with biscuits to be dipped
in the tea and eaten before consuming the tea. More often than not, it is drunk
in "doses" of small cups (referred to as "Cutting" chai if sold at street tea
vendors) rather than one large cup. On 21 April 2012, the Deputy Chairman of
Planning_Commission_(India), Montek_Singh_Ahluwalia, said tea would be declared
as national drink by April 2013.[102][103] The move is expected to boost the
tea industry in the country. Speaking on the occasion, Assam Chief Minister
Tarun_Gogoi said a special package for the tea industry would be announced in
the future to ensure its development.[104] The history_of_tea_in_India is
especially rich.
In Burma (Myanmar), tea is consumed not only as hot drinks, but also as sweet
tea and green tea known locally as laphet-yay and laphet-yay-gyan,
respectively. Pickled tea leaves, known locally as laphet, are also a national
delicacy. Pickled tea is usually eaten with roasted sesame seeds, crispy fried
beans, roasted peanuts and fried garlic chips.[105]
In Mali, gunpowder_tea is served in series of three, starting with the highest
oxidisation or strongest, unsweetened tea, locally referred to as "strong like
death", followed by a second serving, where the same tea leaves are boiled
again with some sugar added ("pleasant as life"), and a third one, where the
same tea leaves are boiled for the third time with yet more sugar added ("sweet
as love"). Green tea is the central ingredient of a distinctly Malian custom,
the "Grin", an informal social gathering that cuts across social and economic
lines, starting in front of family compound gates in the afternoons and
extending late into the night, and is widely popular in Bamako and other large
urban areas.[citation_needed]
In the United States, 80% of tea is consumed as iced_tea.[106] Sweet_tea is
native to the southeastern_US, and is iconic in its cuisine.[107]

Tea is the most popular manufactured drink consumed in the world, equaling all
others â including coffee, chocolate, soft drinks, and alcohol â combined.
[4] Most tea consumed outside East Asia is produced on large plantations in the
hilly regions of India and Sri Lanka, and is destined to be sold to large
businesses. Opposite this large-scale industrial production are many small
"gardens," sometimes minuscule plantations, that produce highly sought-after
teas prized by gourmets. These teas are both rare and expensive, and can be
compared to some of the most expensive wines in this respect.
India is the world's largest tea-drinking nation,[109] although the per capita
consumption of tea remains a modest 750 grams (26 oz) per person every year.
Turkey, with 2.5 kilograms (5.5 lb) of tea consumed per person per year, is the
world's greatest per capita consumer.[110]
**** Labor and consumer safety problems ****
Multiple recent[when?] reports have found that most Chinese and Indian teas
contain residues of banned toxic pesticides.[111][112][113][114]
Tea production in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda has been reported
to make use of child_labor according to the U.S._Department_of_Labor's List_of
Goods_Produced_by_Child_Labor_or_Forced_Labor[115] (a report on the worst forms
of child labor).
**** Certification ****
Workers who pick and pack tea on plantations in developing countries can face
harsh working conditions and may earn below the living_wage.[116]
A number of bodies independently certify the production of tea. Tea from
certified estates can be sold with a certification label on the pack. The most
important certification schemes are Rainforest_Alliance, Fairtrade, UTZ
Certified, and Organic,[citation_needed] which also certify other crops such as
coffee, cocoa and fruit. Rainforest Alliance certified tea is sold by Unilever
brands Lipton and PG_Tips in Western Europe, Australia and the US. Fairtrade
certified tea is sold by a large number of suppliers around the world. UTZ
Certified announced a partnership in 2008 with Sara Lee brand Pickwick_tea.
Production of organic tea has risen since its introduction in 1990 at Rembeng,
Kondoli Tea Estate, Assam.[117] 6,000 tons of organic tea were sold in 1999.
[118] About 75% of organic tea production is sold in France, Germany, Japan,
the United Kingdom, and the United States.[citation_needed]
**** Trade ****
In 2013, China â the world's largest producer of tea â exported 325,806
tonnes, or 14% of their total crop.[119] India exported 254,841 tonnes or 20%
of their total production.[119]
In 2013, the largest importer of tea was the Russian_Federation with 173,070
tonnes, followed by the United_Kingdom, the United States, and Pakistan.[119]
***** Packaging *****
**** Tea bags ****
Tea bags
Main article: Tea_bag
In 1907, American tea merchant Thomas Sullivan began distributing samples of
his tea in small bags of Chinese_silk with a drawstring. Consumers noticed they
could simply leave the tea in the bag and reuse it with fresh tea. However, the
potential of this distribution and packaging method would not be fully realised
until later on. During World_War_II, tea was rationed in the United Kingdom. In
1953, after rationing_in_the_UK ended, Tetley launched the tea bag to the UK
and it was an immediate success.
The "pyramid tea bag" (or sachet), introduced by Lipton[120] and PG_Tips/
Scottish Blend in 1996,[121] attempts to address one of the connoisseurs'
arguments against paper tea bags by way of its three-dimensional tetrahedron
shape, which allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping.[citation
needed] However, some types of pyramid tea bags have been criticised as being
environmentally unfriendly, since their synthetic material is not as
biodegradable as loose tea leaves and paper tea bags.[122]
**** Loose tea ****
A blend of loose-leaf black teas
The tea leaves are packaged loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other
container such as a tea_chest. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder_tea
leaves, which resist crumbling, are sometimes vacuum-packed for freshness in
aluminised_packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea must be individually
measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavour control at the expense
of convenience. Strainers, tea_balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and
infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A
traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, the lid of
which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.
**** Compressed tea ****
Compressed_tea (such as pu-erh) is produced for convenience in transport,
storage, and ageing. It can usually be stored longer without spoilage than
loose leaf tea.
Compressed tea is prepared by loosening leaves from the cake using a small
knife, and steeping the extracted pieces in water. During the Tang dynasty, as
described by Lu Yu, compressed tea was ground into a powder, combined with hot
water, and ladled into bowls, resulting in a "frothy" mixture.[123] In the Song
dynasty, the tea powder would instead be whisked with hot water in the bowl.
Although no longer practiced in China today, the whisking method of preparing
powdered tea was transmitted to Japan by Zen Buddhist monks, and is still used
to prepare matcha in the Japanese_tea_ceremony.[124]
Compressed tea was the most popular form of tea in China during the Tang
dynasty.[125] By the beginning of the Ming dynasty, it had been displaced by
loose-leaf tea.[126] It remains popular, however, in the Himalayan countries
and Mongolian steppes. In Mongolia, tea bricks were ubiquitous enough to be
used as a form of currency. Among Himalayan peoples, compressed tea is consumed
by combining it with yak_butter and salt to produce butter_tea.[127]
**** Instant tea ****
"Instant tea", similar to freeze-dried instant_coffee and an alternative to
brewed tea, can be consumed either hot or cold. Instant tea was developed in
the 1930s, with NestlÃ© introducing the first commercial product in 1946, while
Redi-Tea debuted instant iced_tea in 1953.
Delicacy of flavour is sacrificed for convenience. Additives such as chai,
vanilla, honey or fruit, are popular, as is powdered_milk.
During the Second World War British and Canadian soldiers were issued an
instant tea known as "Compo" in their Composite Ration Packs. These blocks of
instant tea, powdered milk, and sugar were not always well received. As Royal
Canadian Artillery Gunner, George C Blackburn observed:
     But, unquestionably, the feature of Compo rations destined to be
     remembered beyond all others is Compo tea...Directions say to
     "sprinkle powder on heated water and bring to the boil, stirring
     well, three heaped teaspoons to one pint of water."
     Every possible variation in the preparation of this tea was tried,
     but...it always ended up the same way. While still too hot to drink,
     it is a good-looking cup of strong tea. Even when it becomes just
     cool enough to be sipped gingerly, it is still a good-tasting cup of
     tea, if you like your tea strong and sweet. But let it cool enough to
     be quaffed and enjoyed, and your lips will be coated with a sticky
     scum that forms across the surface, which if left undisturbed will
     become a leathery membrane that can be wound around your finger and
     flipped away...[128]
**** Bottled and canned tea ****
Main article: Canned_tea
Canned tea is sold prepared and ready to drink. It was introduced in 1981 in
Japan.
The first bottled tea introduced by Indonesian tea company PT. Sinar Sosro in
1969 with brand name Teh Botol Sosro (or Sosro bottled tea).[129]
In 1983, Swiss-based Bischofszell Food Ltd., was the first company to bottle
iced tea on an industrial scale.[130]
***** Storage *****
Storage conditions and type determine the shelf_life of tea. Black tea's is
greater than green's. Some, such as flower teas, may last only a month or so.
Others, such as pu-erh, improve with age.
To remain fresh and prevent mold, tea needs to be stored away from heat, light,
air, and moisture. Tea must be kept at room temperature in an air-tight
container. Black tea in a bag within a sealed opaque canister may keep for two
years. Green tea deteriorates more rapidly, usually in less than a year.
Tightly rolled gunpowder tea leaves keep longer than the more open-leafed Chun
Mee_tea.
Storage life for all teas can be extended by using desiccant or oxygen-
absorbing packets, vacuum sealing, or refrigeration in air-tight containers
(except green tea, where discrete use of refrigeration or freezing is
recommended and temperature variation kept to a minimum).[131]

      that both varieties have the same chromosome number (n=15) and can be

      British who introduced tea drinking to India, initially to anglicized
      Indians. Tea did not become a mass drink there until the 1950s when the
      India Tea Board, faced with a surplus of low-grade tea, launched an
      advertising campaign to popularize it in the north, where the drink of
      choice was milk.
