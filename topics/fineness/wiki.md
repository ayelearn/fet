****** Fineness ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The fineness of a precious_metal object (coin, bar, jewelry, etc.) represents
the weight of fine metal therein, in proportion to the total weight which
includes alloying base_metals and any impurities. Alloy metals are added to
increase hardness and durability of coins and jewelry, alter colors, decrease
the cost per weight, or avoid the cost of high-purity refinement. For example,
copper is added to the precious metal silver to make a more durable alloy for
use in coins, housewares and jewelry. Coin silver, which was used for making
silver_coins in the past, contains 90% silver and 10% copper, by mass. Sterling
silver contains 92.5% silver and 7.5% of other metals, usually copper, by mass.
Various ways of expressing fineness have been used and two remain in common
use: millesimal fineness expressed in units of parts_per_1,000[1] and karats
used only for gold. Karats measure the parts per 24, so that 18 karat =
&#x200b;18⁄24 = 75% and 24 karat gold is considered 100% gold.[2]

***** Millesimal fineness[edit] *****
Millesimal fineness is a system of denoting the purity of platinum, gold and
silver alloys by parts_per_thousand of pure metal by mass in the alloy. For
example, an alloy containing 75% gold is denoted as "750". Many European
countries use decimal hallmark stamps (i.e., "585", "750", etc.) rather than
"14K", "18K", etc., which is used in the United Kingdom and United States.
It is an extension of the older karat system of denoting the purity of gold by
fractions of 24, such as "18 karat" for an alloy with 75% (18 parts per 24)
pure gold by mass.
The millesimal fineness is usually rounded to a three figure number,
particularly where used as a hallmark, and the fineness may vary slightly from
the traditional versions of purity.
Here are the most common millesimal finenesses used for precious_metals and the
most common terms associated with them.
**** Platinum[edit] ****
    * 999.5: what most dealers would buy as if 100% pure; the most common
      purity for platinum bullion coins and bars

      Perth_Mint in 1957.[3][4]
    * 999.99âfive nines fine: the purest type of gold currently produced; the
      Royal_Canadian_Mint regularly produces commemorative coins in this
      fineness, including the world's largest at 100 kg.[5]
    * 999.9âfour nines fine: e.g., ordinary Canadian_Gold_Maple_Leaf and
      American_Buffalo coins

    * 500: Standard used for making British coinage after 1920
***** Karat[edit] *****
See the article carat_(mass) for the unit of mass (weight) used for precious
stones and pearls
The karat (US spelling, symbol K or kt) or carat (UK spelling, symbol C or ct)
[9][10] is a fractional measure of purity for gold alloys, in parts fine per 24
parts whole. The karat system is a standard adopted by US federal law.[11]
**** Measure[edit] ****
      K is the karat rating of the material,
      Mg is the mass of pure gold in the alloy, and
      Mm is the total mass of the material.
24-karat gold is pure (while 100% purity is unattainable, this designation is
permitted in commerce for 99.95% purity), 18-karat gold is 18 parts gold, 6
parts another metal (forming an alloy with 75% gold), 12-karat gold is 12 parts
gold (12 parts another metal), and so forth.[12]
In England, the karat was divisible into four grains, and the grain was
divisible into four quarts. For example, a gold alloy of &#x200b;127⁄128
fineness (that is, 99.2% purity) could have been described as being 23-karat,
3-grain, 1-quart gold.
The karat fractional system is increasingly being complemented or superseded by
the millesimal system, described above.
Conversion between percentage of pure gold and karats:
    * 58.33â62.50% = 14K (acclaimed 58.33%)
    * 75.00â79.16% = 18K (acclaimed 75.00%)
    * 91.66â95.83% = 22K (acclaimed 91.66%)
    * 95.83â99.95% = 23K (acclaimed 95.83%)
    * 99.95â100% = 24K (acclaimed 99.95%)
**** Volume[edit] ****
However, this system of calculation gives only the mass of pure gold contained
in an alloy. The term 18-karat gold means that the alloy's mass consists of 75%
of gold and 25% of alloy(s). The quantity of gold by volume in a less-than-24-
karat gold alloy differs according to the alloy(s) used. For example, knowing
that standard 18-karat yellow gold consists of 75% gold, 12.5% silver and the
remaining 12.5% of copper (all by mass), the volume of pure gold in this alloy
will be 60% since gold is much denser than the other metals used: 19.32 g/cm3
for gold, 10.49 g/cm3 for silver and 8.96 g/cm3 for copper.
This formula gives the amount of gold in cubic centimeters or in milliliters in
an alloy:
          V  Au   =     M  a   &#x00D7;    k t  24    19.32     {\displaystyle
      V_{\text{Au}}={\frac {M_{\text{a}}\times {\frac {kt}{24}}}{19.32}}}  [
      {\displaystyle V_{\text{Au}}={\frac {M_{\text{a}}\times {\frac {kt}{24}}}
      {19.32}}}]
where
      VAu is the volume of gold in cubic centimeters or in milliliters,
      Ma is the total mass of the alloy in grams, and
      kt is the karat purity of the alloy.
To have the percentage of the volume of gold in an alloy, divide the volume of
gold in cubic centimetres or in millilitres by the total volume of the alloy in
cubic centimetres or in millilitres.
For 10-carat gold, the gold volume in the alloy represents about 26% of the
total volume for standard yellow gold. Talking about purity according to mass
could lead to some misunderstandings; for many people, purity means volume.
**** Etymology[edit] ****
Karat is a variant of carat. First attested in English in the mid-15th century,
the word carat came from Middle_French carat, in turn derived either from
Italian carato or Medieval Latin carratus. These were borrowed into Medieval
Europe from the Arabic qÄ«rÄá¹­ meaning "fruit of the carob tree", also
"weight of 4 grains", (ÙÙØ±Ø§Ø·‎) and was a unit of mass[13] though it was
probably not used to measure gold in classical times.[14] The Arabic term
ultimately originates from the Greek kerÃ¡tion (ÎºÎµÏÎ¬ÏÎ¹Î¿Î½) meaning carob
seed (literally "small horn")[14][15][16] (diminutive of ÎºÎ­ÏÎ±Ï â keras,
"horn"[17]).
In 309 CE, Roman_Emperor Constantine_I began to mint a new gold coin solidus
that was &#x200b;1⁄72 of a libra (Roman pound) of gold[18] equal to a mass of
24 siliquae, where each siliqua (or carat) was &#x200b;1⁄1728 of a libra.[19]
This is believed to be the origin of the value of the karat.[20]
***** Verifying fineness[edit] *****
While there are many methods of detecting fake precious metals, there are
realistically only two options available for verifying the marked fineness of
metal as being reasonably accurate: assaying the metal (which requires
destroying it), or using X-ray_fluorescence (XRF). XRF will only measure the
outermost portion of the piece of metal, so it may get fooled by thick plating.
This becomes a concern because it would be possible for an unscrupulous refiner
to produce precious metals bars that are slightly less pure than what they mark
the bar. A refiner doing $1 billion of business each year that marked .980 pure
bars as .999 fine would make about an extra $20 million in profit. In the
United States, the actual purity of gold articles must be no less than .003
less than the marked purity (e.g. .996 fine for gold marked .999 fine), and the
actual purity of silver articles must be no less than .004 less than the marked
purity.[21]
***** Fine weight[edit] *****
A piece of alloy metal containing a precious metal may also have the weight of
its precious component referred to as its fine weight. For example, 1 troy
ounce of 18 karat gold (which is 75% gold) may be said to have a fine weight of
0.75 troy ounces.
***** Troy mass of silver content[edit] *****
Fineness of silver in Britain was traditionally expressed as the mass of silver
expressed in troy_ounces and pennyweights (&#x200b;1⁄20 troy ounce), in one
troy_pound (12 troy ounces) of the resulting alloy. Britannia_silver has a
fineness of 11 troy ounces, 10 pennyweights, or about 95.833% silver, whereas
sterling_silver has a fineness of 11 troy ounces, 2 pennyweights, or exactly
92.5% silver.
