Relocation of an electron from an atom or molecule to another
Electron transfer (ET) occurs when an electron relocates from an atom or
molecule to another such chemical entity. ET is a mechanistic description of a
redox reaction, wherein the oxidation state of reactant and product changes.
Electron transfer is ionic bonding.
Numerous biological_processes involve ET reactions. These processes include
oxygen binding, photosynthesis, respiration, and detoxification. Additionally,
the process of energy_transfer can be formalized as a two-electron exchange
(two concurrent ET events in opposite directions) in case of small distances
between the transferring molecules. ET reactions commonly involve transition
metal_complexes,[1][2] but there are now many examples of ET in organic
chemistry.

***** Classes of electron transfer[edit] *****
There are several classes of electron transfer, defined by the state of the two
redox centers and their connectivity
**** Inner-sphere electron transfer[edit] ****
Main article: Inner-sphere_electron_transfer
In inner-sphere ET, the two redox centers are covalently linked during the ET.
This bridge can be permanent, in which case the electron transfer event is
termed intramolecular electron transfer. More commonly, however, the covalent
linkage is transitory, forming just prior to the ET and then disconnecting
following the ET event. In such cases, the electron transfer is termed
intermolecular electron transfer. A famous example of an inner sphere ET
process that proceeds via a transitory bridged intermediate is the reduction of
[CoCl(NH3)5]2+ by [Cr(H2O)6]2+. In this case the chloride ligand is the
bridging ligand that covalently connects the redox partners.
**** Outer-sphere electron transfer[edit] ****
Main article: Outer-sphere_electron_transfer
In outer-sphere ET reactions, the participating redox centers are not linked
via any bridge during the ET event. Instead, the electron "hops" through space
from the reducing center to the acceptor. Outer sphere electron transfer can
occur between different chemical species or between identical chemical species
that differ only in their oxidation state. The later process is termed self-
exchange. As an example, self-exchange describes the degenerate reaction
between permanganate and its one-electron reduced relative manganate:
      [MnO4]â + [Mn*O4]2â â [MnO4]2â + [Mn*O4]â
In general, if electron transfer is faster than ligand substitution, the
reaction will follow the outer-sphere electron transfer.
Often occurs when one/both reactants are inert or if there is no suitable
bridging ligand.
A key concept of Marcus_theory is that the rates of such self-exchange
reactions are mathematically related to the rates of "cross reactions". Cross
reactions entail partners that differ by more than their oxidation states. One
example (of many thousands) is the reduction of permanganate by iodide to form
iodine and, again, manganate.
*** Five steps of an outer sphere reaction[edit] ***
    * 1. reactants diffuse together out of their solvent shells => precursor
      complex (requires work =wr)
    * 2. changing bond lengths, reorganize solvent => activated complex
    * 3. Electron transfer
    * 4. Relaxation of bond lengths, solvent molecules => successor complex
    * 5. Diffusion of products (requires work=wp)
**** Heterogeneous electron transfer[edit] ****
In heterogeneous electron transfer, an electron moves between a chemical
species and a solid-state electrode. Theories addressing heterogeneous electron
transfer have applications in electrochemistry and the design of solar_cells.
***** Theory[edit] *****
The first generally accepted theory of ET was developed by Rudolph_A._Marcus to
address outer-sphere_electron_transfer and was based on a transition-state
theory approach. The Marcus theory of electron transfer was then extended to
include inner-sphere_electron_transfer by Noel_Hush and Marcus. The resultant
theory, called Marcus-Hush_theory, has guided most discussions of electron
transfer ever since. Both theories are, however, semiclassical in nature,
although they have been extended to fully quantum_mechanical treatments by
Joshua_Jortner, Alexander_M._Kuznetsov, and others proceeding from Fermi's
Golden_Rule and following earlier work in non-radiative_transitions.
Furthermore, theories have been put forward to take into account the effects of
vibronic_coupling on electron transfer; in particular, the PKS_theory_of
electron_transfer.[3]
Before 1991, ET in metalloproteins was thought to affect primarily the diffuse,
averaged properties of the non-metal atoms forming an insulated barrier between
the metals, but Beratan, Betts and Onuchic [4] subsequently showed that the ET
rates are governed by the bond structures of the proteins -- that the
electrons, in effect, tunnel through the bonds comprising the chain structure
of the proteins.
