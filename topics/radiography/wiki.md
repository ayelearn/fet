Radiography is an imaging_technique using X-rays, gamma_rays, or similar
ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation[1] to view the internal form of
an object. Applications of radiography include medical_radiography
("diagnostic" and "therapeutic") and industrial_radiography. Similar techniques
are used in airport_security (where "body scanners" generally use backscatter
X-ray). To create an image in Conventional_Radiography, a beam of X-rays is
produced by an X-ray_generator and is projected toward the object. A certain
amount of the X-rays or other radiation is absorbed by the object, dependent on
the object's density and structural composition. The X-rays that pass through
the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either photographic
film or a digital detector). The generation of flat two_dimensional images by
this technique is called projectional_radiography. In computed_tomography (CT
scanning) an X-ray source and its associated detectors rotate around the
subject which itself moves through the conical X-ray beam produced. Any given
point within the subject is crossed from many directions by many different
beams at different times. Information regarding attenuation of these beams is
collated and subjected to computation to generate two dimensional images in
three planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) which can be further processed to
produce a three dimensional image.

ICD-9-CM     87, 88.0-88.6

Since the body is made up of various substances with differing densities,
Ionising and non-ionising radiation can be used to reveal the internal
structure of the body on an image receptor by highlighting these differences
using attenuation, or in the case of ionising radiation, the absorption of X-
ray photons by the denser substances (like calcium-rich bones). The discipline
involving the study of anatomy through the use of radiographic images is known
as radiographic_anatomy. Medical radiography acquisition is generally carried
out by radiographers, while image analysis is generally done by radiologists.
Some radiographers also specialise in image interpretation. Medical radiography
includes a range of modalities producing many different types of image, each of
which has a different clinical application.
**** Projectional radiography[edit] ****
Main article: Projectional_Radiography
Acquisition of projectional_radiography, with an X-ray_generator and a
detector.
The creation of images by exposing an object to X-rays or other high-energy
forms of electromagnetic_radiation and capturing the resulting remnant beam (or
"shadow") as a latent image is known as "projection radiography." The "shadow"
may be converted to light using a fluorescent screen, which is then captured on
photographic_film, it may be captured by a phosphor screen to be "read" later
by a laser (CR), or it may directly activate a matrix of solid-state detectors
(DRâsimilar to a very large version of a CCD in a digital camera). Bone and
some organs (such as lungs) especially lend themselves to projection
radiography. It is a relatively low-cost investigation with a high diagnostic
yield. The difference between soft and hard body parts stems mostly from the
fact that carbon has a very low X-ray cross section compared to calcium.
**** Computed tomography[edit] ****
Main article: Computed_tomography
Images generated from computed_tomography, including a 3D_rendered image at
upper left.
Computed_tomography or CT scan (previously known as CAT scan, the "A" standing
for "axial") uses ionizing radiation (x-ray radiation) in conjunction with a
computer to create images of both soft and hard tissues. These images look as
though the patient was sliced like bread (thus, "tomography"-- "tomo" means
"slice"). Though CT uses a higher amount of ionizing x-radiation than
diagnostic x-rays (both utilising X-ray radiation), with advances in
technology, levels of CT radiation dose and scan times have reduced[2]. CT
exams are generally short, most lasting only as long as a breath-hold, Contrast
agents are also often used, depending on the tissues needing to be seen.
Radiographers perform these examinations, sometimes in conjunction with a
radiologist (for instance, when a radiologist performs a CT-guided biopsy).
**** Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry[edit] ****
Main article: Dual_energy_X-ray_absorptiometry
DEXA, or bone densitometry, is used primarily for osteoporosis tests. It is not
projection radiography, as the X-rays are emitted in 2 narrow beams that are
scanned across the patient, 90 degrees from each other. Usually the hip (head
of the femur), lower back (lumbar_spine), or heel (calcaneum) are imaged, and
the bone density (amount of calcium) is determined and given a number (a T-
score). It is not used for bone imaging, as the image quality is not good
enough to make an accurate diagnostic image for fractures, inflammation, etc.
It can also be used to measure total body fat, though this is not common. The
radiation dose received from DEXA scans is very low, much lower than projection
radiography examinations.
**** Fluoroscopy[edit] ****
Main article: Fluoroscopy
Fluoroscopy is a term invented by Thomas Edison during his early X-ray studies.
The name refers to the fluorescence he saw while looking at a glowing plate
bombarded with X-rays.[3]
The technique provides moving projection radiographs. Fluoroscopy is mainly
performed to view movement (of tissue or a contrast agent), or to guide a
medical intervention, such as angioplasty, pacemaker insertion, or joint
repair/replacement. The latter can often be carried out in the operating
theatre, using a portable fluoroscopy machine called a C-arm.[4] It can move
around the surgery table and make digital images for the surgeon. Biplanar
Fluoroscopy works the same as single plane fluoroscopy except displaying two
planes at the same time. The ability to work in two planes is important for
orthopedic and spinal surgery and can reduce operating times by eliminating re-
positioning.[5]
*** Angiography[edit] ***
Angiogram showing a transverse_projection of the vertebro basilar and posterior
cerebral circulation.
Main article: Angiography
Angiography is the use of fluoroscopy to view the cardiovascular system. An
iodine-based contrast is injected into the bloodstream and watched as it
travels around. Since liquid blood and the vessels are not very dense, a
contrast with high density (like the large iodine atoms) is used to view the
vessels under X-ray. Angiography is used to find aneurysms, leaks, blockages
(thromboses), new vessel growth, and placement of catheters and stents. Balloon
angioplasty is often done with angiography.
**** Contrast radiography[edit] ****
Main article: Radiocontrast_agent
Contrast radiography uses a radiocontrast agent, a type of contrast_medium, to
make the structures of interest stand out visually from their background.
Contrast agents are required in conventional angiography, and can be used in
both projectional_radiography and computed_tomography (called "contrast_CT").
[6][7]
**** Other medical imaging[edit] ****
Although not technically radiographic techniques due to not using X-rays,
imaging modalities such as PET and MRI are sometimes grouped in radiography
because the radiology department of hospitals handle all forms of imaging.
Treatment using radiation is known as radiotherapy.
***** Industrial radiography[edit] *****
Main article: Industrial_radiography
Industrial_radiography is a method of non-destructive_testing where many types
of manufactured components can be examined to verify the internal structure and
integrity of the specimen. Industrial Radiography can be performed utilizing
either X-rays or gamma_rays. Both are forms of electromagnetic_radiation. The
difference between various forms of electromagnetic energy is related to the
wavelength. X and gamma rays have the shortest wavelength and this property
leads to the ability to penetrate, travel through, and exit various materials
such as carbon_steel and other metals. Specific methods include industrial
computed_tomography.
Radiography may also be used in paleontology, such as for these radiographs of
the Darwinius fossil Ida.
***** Image quality[edit] *****
Sharpness of a radiographic image is strongly determined by the size of the X-
ray source. This is determined by the area of the electron beam hitting the
anode. A large photon source results in more blurring in the final image and is
worsened by an increase in image formation distance. This blurring can be
measured as a contribution to the modulation_transfer_function of the imaging
system.
***** Radiation dose[edit] *****
The dosage of radiation applied in radiography varies by procedure. For
example, the effective dosage of a chest x-ray is 0.1 mSv, while an abdominal
CT is 10 mSv.[8] The American_Association_of_Physicists_in_Medicine (AAPM) have
stated that the "risks of medical imaging at patient doses below 50 mSv for
single procedures or 100 mSv for multiple procedures over short time periods
are too low to be detectable and may be nonexistent." Other scientific bodies
sharing this conclusion include the International_Organization_of_Medical
Physicists, the UN_Scientific_Committee_on_the_Effects_of_Atomic_Radiation, and
the International_Commission_on_Radiological_Protection. Nonetheless,
radiological organizations, including the Radiological_Society_of_North_America
(RSNA) and the American_College_of_Radiology (ACR), as well as multiple
government agencies, indicate safety standards to ensure that radiation dosage
is as low as possible.[9]
**** Shielding[edit] ****
Lead is the most common shield against X-rays because of its high density
(11340 kg/m3), stopping power, ease of installation and low cost. The maximum
range of a high-energy photon such as an X-ray in matter is infinite; at every
point in the matter traversed by the photon, there is a probability of
interaction. Thus there is a very small probability of no interaction over very
large distances. The shielding of photon beam is therefore exponential (with an
attenuation_length being close to the radiation_length of the material);
doubling the thickness of shielding will square the shielding effect.

The following table shows the recommended thickness of lead shielding in
function of X-ray energy, from the Recommendations by the Second International
Congress of Radiology.[10]
**** Campaigns[edit] ****
In response to increased concern by the public over radiation doses and the
ongoing progress of best practices, The Alliance for Radiation Safety in
Pediatric Imaging was formed within the Society_for_Pediatric_Radiology. In
concert with the American_Society_of_Radiologic_Technologists, the American
College_of_Radiology, and the American_Association_of_Physicists_in_Medicine,
the Society for Pediatric Radiology developed and launched the Image Gently
campaign which is designed to maintain high quality imaging studies while using
the lowest doses and best radiation safety practices available on pediatric
patients.[11] This initiative has been endorsed and applied by a growing list
of various professional medical organizations around the world and has received
support and assistance from companies that manufacture equipment used in
radiology.
Following upon the success of the Image Gently campaign, the American College
of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, the American
Association of Physicists in Medicine, and the American Society of Radiologic
Technologists have launched a similar campaign to address this issue in the
adult population called Image Wisely.[12] The World_Health_Organization and
International_Atomic_Energy_Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations have also been
working in this area and have ongoing projects designed to broaden best
practices and lower patient radiation dose.[13][14][15]
**** Provider payment[edit] ****
Contrary to advice that emphasises only conducting radiographs when in the
patient's interest, recent evidence suggests that they are used more frequently
when dentists are paid under fee-for-service[16]
***** Equipment[edit] *****

**** Sources[edit] ****
Further information: X-ray_generator
In medicine and dentistry, projectional_radiography and computed_tomography
images generally use X-rays created by X-ray_generators, which generate X-rays
from X-ray_tubes. The resultant images from the radiograph (X-ray generator/
machine) or CT scanner are correctly referred to as "radiograms"/
"roentgenograms" and "tomograms" respectively.
A number of other sources of X-ray photons are possible, and may be used in
industrial radiography or research; these include betatrons, and linear
accelerators (linacs) and synchrotrons. For gamma_rays, radioactive sources
such as 192Ir, 60Co or 137Cs are used.
**** Grid[edit] ****
A Bucky-Potter_grid may be placed between the patient and the detector to
reduce the quantity of scattered x-rays that reach the detector. This improves
the contrast resolution of the image, but also increases radiation exposure for
the patient.[17]
**** Detectors[edit] ****
Main article: X-ray_detector
Detectors can be divided into two major categories: imaging detectors (such as
photographic_plates and X-ray film (photographic_film), now mostly replaced by
various digitizing devices like image_plates or flat_panel_detectors) and dose
measurement devices (such as ionization_chambers, Geiger_counters, and
dosimeters used to measure the local radiation_exposure, dose, and/or dose
rate, for example, for verifying that radiation_protection equipment and
procedures are effective on an ongoing basis).[18][19][20]
**** Image intensifiers and array detectors[edit] ****
Main article: X-ray_image_intensifier
As an alternative to X-ray detectors, image_intensifiers are analog devices
that readily convert the acquired X-ray image into one visible on a video
screen. This device is made of a vacuum tube with a wide input surface coated
on the inside with caesium_iodide (CsI). When hit by X-rays material phosphors
which causes the photocathode adjacent to it to emit electrons. These electron
are then focus using electron lenses inside the intensifier to an output screen
coated with phosphorescent materials. The image from the output can then be
recorded via a camera and displayed.[21]
Digital devices known as array detectors are becoming more common in
fluoroscopy. These devices are made of discrete pixelated detectors known as
thin-film_transistors (TFT) which can either work indirectly by using photo
detectors that detect light emitted from a scintillator material such as CsI,
or directly by capturing the electrons produced when the X-rays hit the
detector. Direct detector do not tend to experience the blurring or spreading
effect caused by phosphorescent scintillators of or film screens since the
detectors are activated directly by X-ray photons.[22]
***** Dual-energy[edit] *****
Dual-energy radiography is where images are acquired using two separate tube
voltages. This is the standard method for bone_densitometry. It is also used in
CT_pulmonary_angiography to decrease the required dose of iodinated_contrast.
[23]
***** History[edit] *****
Further information: X-ray_Â§ History
Taking an X-ray image with early Crookes_tube apparatus, late 1800s.
Radiography's origins and fluoroscopy's_origins can both be traced to 8
November 1895, when German physics professor Wilhelm_Conrad_RÃ¶ntgen discovered
the X-ray and noted that, while it could pass through human tissue, it could
not pass through bone or metal.[24] RÃ¶ntgen referred to the radiation as "X",
to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. He received the first
Nobel_Prize_in_Physics for his discovery.[25]
There are conflicting accounts of his discovery because RÃ¶ntgen had his lab
notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his
biographers:[26][27] RÃ¶ntgen was investigating cathode_rays using a
fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide and a Crookes_tube which
he had wrapped in black cardboard to shield its fluorescent glow. He noticed a
faint green glow from the screen, about 1 metre away. RÃ¶ntgen realized some
invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make
the screen glow: they were passing through an opaque object to affect the film
behind it.[28]
The first radiograph
RÃ¶ntgen discovered X-rays' medical use when he made a picture of his wife's
hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. The photograph of his wife's
hand was the first ever photograph of a human body part using X-rays. When she
saw the picture, she said, "I have seen my death."[28]
The first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by John_Hall-Edwards in
Birmingham,_England on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in
the hand of an associate.[29] On 14 February 1896, Hall-Edwards also became the
first to use X-rays in a surgical operation.[30]
The United States saw its first medical X-ray obtained using a discharge_tube
of Ivan_Pulyui's design. In January 1896, on reading of RÃ¶ntgen's discovery,
Frank Austin of Dartmouth_College tested all of the discharge tubes in the
physics laboratory and found that only the Pulyui tube produced X-rays. This
was a result of Pulyui's inclusion of an oblique "target" of mica, used for
holding samples of fluorescent material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896
Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin
Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Gilman
had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture, to the X-rays and collected the
resulting image of the broken bone on gelatin_photographic_plates obtained from
Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in RÃ¶ntgen's work.[31]
X-rays were put to diagnostic use very early; for example, Alan_Archibald
Campbell-Swinton opened a radiographic laboratory in the United Kingdom in
1896, before the dangers of ionizing radiation were discovered. Indeed, Marie
Curie pushed for radiography to be used to treat wounded soldiers in World War
I. Initially, many kinds of staff conducted radiography in hospitals, including
Physicists, Photographers, Physicians, Nurses, and Engineers. The medical
speciality of radiology grew up over many years around the new technology. When
new diagnostic tests were developed, it was natural for the Radiographers to be
trained in and to adopt this new technology. Radiographers now perform
fluoroscopy, computed_tomography, mammography, ultrasound, nuclear_medicine and
magnetic_resonance_imaging as well. Although a nonspecialist dictionary might
define radiography quite narrowly as "taking X-ray images", this has long been
only part of the work of "X-ray Departments", Radiographers, and Radiologists.
Initially, radiographs were known as roentgenograms,[32] while Skiagrapher
(from the Ancient_Greek words for "shadow" and "writer") was used until about
1918 to mean Radiographer. The Japanese term for the radiograph,
ã¬ã³ãã²ã³ (rentogen), shares its etymology with the original English
term.
