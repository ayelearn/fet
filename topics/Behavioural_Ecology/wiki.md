Behavioral ecology, also spelled behavioural ecology, is the study of the
evolutionary basis for animal_behavior due to ecological pressures. Behavioral
ecology emerged from ethology after Niko_Tinbergen outlined four_questions to
address when studying animal behaviors that are the proximate_causes, ontogeny,
survival_value, and phylogeny of behavior.
If an organism has a trait that provides a selective advantage (i.e., has
adaptive significance) in its environment, then natural_selection favors it.
Adaptive significance refers to the expression of a trait that affects fitness,
measured by an individual's reproductive success. Adaptive traits are those
that produce more copies of the individual's genes in future generations.
Maladaptive traits are those that leave fewer. For example, if a bird that can
call more loudly attracts more mates, then a loud call is an adaptive trait for
that species because a louder bird mates more frequently than less loud
birdsâthus sending more loud-calling genes into future generations.
Individuals are always in competition with others for limited resources,
including food, territories, and mates. Conflict occurs between predators and
prey, between rivals for mates, between siblings, mates, and even between
parents and offspring.

***** Competing for resources[edit] *****
The value of a social behavior depends in part on the social behavior of an
animal's neighbors. For example, the more likely a rival male is to back down
from a threat, the more value a male gets out of making the threat. The more
likely, however, that a rival will attack if threatened, the less useful it is
to threaten other males. When a population exhibits a number of interacting
social behaviors such as this, it can evolve a stable pattern of behaviors
known as an evolutionarily_stable_strategy (or ESS). This term, derived from
economic game_theory, became prominent after John_Maynard_Smith (1982)[1]
recognized the possible application of the concept of a Nash_equilibrium to
model the evolution of behavioral strategies.
**** Evolutionarily stable strategy[edit] ****
In short, evolutionary_game_theory asserts that only strategies that, when
common in the population, cannot be "invaded" by any alternative (mutant)
strategy is an ESS, and thus maintained in the population. In other words, at
equilibrium every player should play the best strategic response to each other.
When the game is two player and symmetric, each player should play the strategy
that provides the response best for it.
Therefore, the ESS is considered the evolutionary end point subsequent to the
interactions. As the fitness conveyed by a strategy is influenced by what other
individuals are doing (the relative frequency of each strategy in the
population), behavior can be governed not only by optimality but the
frequencies of strategies adopted by others and are therefore frequency
dependent (frequency_dependence).
Behavioral evolution is therefore influenced by both the physical environment
and interactions between other individuals.
An example of how changes in geography can make a strategy susceptible to
alternative strategies is the parasitization of the African honey bee, A._m.
scutellata.
**** Resource defense[edit] ****
The term economic defendability was first introduced by Jerram Brown in 1964.
Economic defendability states that defense of a resource have costs, such as
energy expenditure or risk of injury, as well as benefits of priority access to
the resource. Territorial_behavior arises when benefits are greater than the
costs.[2]
Studies of the golden-winged_sunbird have validated the concept of economic
defendability. Comparing the energetic costs a sunbird expends in a day to the
extra nectar gained by defending a territory, researchers showed that birds
only became territorial when they were making a net energetic profit.[3] When
resources are at low density, the gains from excluding others may not be
sufficient to pay for the cost of territorial defense. In contrast, when
resource availability is high, there may be so many intruders that the defender
would have no time to make use of the resources made available by defense.
Sometimes the economics of resource competition favors shared defense. An
example is the feeding territories of the white_wagtail. The white wagtails
feed on insects washed up by the river onto the bank, which acts as a renewing
food supply. If any intruders harvested their territory then the prey would
quickly become depleted, but sometimes territory owners tolerate a second bird,
known as a satellite. The two sharers would then move out of phase with one
another, resulting in decreased feeding rate but also increased defense,
illustrating advantages of group living.[4]
**** Ideal free distribution[edit] ****
Main article: Ideal_free_distribution
One of the major models used to predict the distribution of competing
individuals amongst resource patches is the ideal free distribution model.
Within this model, resource patches can be of variable quality, and there is no
limit to the number of individuals that can occupy and extract resources from a
particular patch. Competition within a particular patch means that the benefit
each individual receives from exploiting a patch decreases logarithmically with
increasing number of competitors sharing that resource patch. The model
predicts that individuals will initially flock to higher-quality patches until
the costs of crowding bring the benefits of exploiting them in line with the
benefits of being the only individual on the lesser-quality resource patch.
After this point has been reached, individuals will alternate between
exploiting the higher-quality patches and the lower-quality patches in such a
way that the average benefit for all individuals in both patches is the same.
This model is ideal in that individuals have complete information about the
quality of a resource patch and the number of individuals currently exploiting
it, and free in that individuals are freely able to choose which resource patch
to exploit.[5]
An experiment by Manfred Malinski in 1979 demonstrated that feeding behavior in
three-spined_sticklebacks follows an ideal free distribution. Six fish were
placed in a tank, and food items were dropped into opposite ends of the tank at
different rates. The rate of food deposition at one end was set at twice that
of the other end, and the fish distributed themselves with four individuals at
the faster-depositing end and two individuals at the slower-depositing end. In
this way, the average feeding rate was the same for all of the fish in the
tank.[6]
**** Mating strategies and tactics[edit] ****
As with any competition of resources, species across the animal kingdom may
also engage in competitions for mating. If one considers mates or potentials
mates as a resource, these sexual partners can be randomly distributed amongst
resource pools within a given environment. Following the ideal free
distribution model, suitors distribute themselves amongst the potential mates
in an effort to maximize their chances or the number of potential matings. For
all competitors, males of a species in most cases, there are variations in both
the strategies and tactics used to obtain matings. Strategies generally refer
to the genetically determined behaviors that can be described as conditional.
Tactics refer to the subset of behaviors within a given genetic strategy. Thus
it is not difficult for a great many variations in mating strategies to exist
in a given environment or species.[7]
An experiment conducted by Anthony Arak, where playback of synthetic calls from
male natterjack_toads was used to manipulate behavior of the males in a chorus,
the difference between strategies and tactics is clear. While small and
immature, male natterjack toads adopted a satellite tactic to parasitize larger
males. Though large males on average still retained greater reproductive
success, smaller males were able to intercept matings. When the large males of
the chorus were removed, smaller males adopted a calling behavior, no longer
competing against the loud calls of larger males. When smaller males got larger
and their calls more competitive, then they started calling and competing
directly for mates.[8]
***** Sexual selection[edit] *****
**** Mate choice by resources[edit] ****
In many sexually reproducing species, such as mammals, birds, and amphibians,
females are able to bear offspring for a certain time period, during which the
males are free to mate with other available females, and therefore can father
many more offspring to pass on their genes. The fundamental difference between
male and female reproduction mechanisms determines the different strategies
each sex employs to maximize their reproductive_success. For males, their
reproductive success is limited by access to females, while females are limited
by their access to resources. In this sense, females can be much choosier than
males because they have to bet on the resources provided by the males to ensure
reproductive success.[9]
Resources usually include nest sites, food and protection. In some cases, the
males provide all of them (e.g. sedge_warblers).[10] The females dwell in their
chosen malesâ territories for access to these resources. The males gain
ownership to the territories through male-male_competition that often involves
physical aggression. Only the largest and strongest males manage to defend the
best quality nest sites. Females choose males by inspecting the quality of
different territories or by looking at some male traits that can indicate the
quality of resources.[9] One example of this is with the grayling butterfly
(Hipparchia_semele), where males engage in complex flight patterns to decide
who defends a particular territory. The female grayling butterfly chooses a
male based on the most optimal location for oviposition.[11] Sometimes, males
leave after mating. The only resource that a male provides is a nuptial_gift,
such as protection or food.[12] The female can evaluate the quality of the
protection or food provided by the male so as to decide whether to mate or not
or how long she is willing to copulate.
**** Mate choice by genes[edit] ****
When males' only contribution to offspring is their sperm, females are
particularly choosy. With this high level of female choice, sexual ornaments
are seen in males, where the ornaments reflect the male's social status. Two
hypotheses have been proposed to conceptualize the genetic benefits from female
mate choice.[9]
First, the good genes hypothesis suggests that female choice is for higher
genetic quality and that this preference is favored because it increases
fitness of the offspring.[13] This includes Zahavi's_handicap_hypothesis and
Hamilton_and_Zuk's_host_and_parasite_arms_race. Zahavi's handicap hypothesis
was proposed within the context of looking at elaborate male sexual displays.
He suggested that females favor ornamented traits because they are handicaps
and are indicators of the male's genetic quality. Since these ornamented traits
are hazards, the male's survival must be indicative of his high genetic quality
in other areas. In this way, the degree that a male expresses his sexual
display indicates to the female his genetic quality.[9] Zuk and Hamilton
proposed a hypothesis after observing disease as a powerful selective pressure
on a rabbit population. They suggested that sexual displays were indicators of
resistance of disease on a genetic level.[9]
Such 'choosiness' from the female individuals can be seen in wasp species too,
especially among Polistes_dominula wasps. The females tend to prefer males with
smaller, more elliptically shaped spots than those with larger and more
irregularly shaped spots. Those males would have reproductive superiority over
males with irregular spots.
Fisher's hypothesis of runaway sexual selection suggests that female preference
is genetically correlated with male traits and that the preference co-evolves
with the evolution of that trait, thus the preference is under indirect
selection.[13] Fisher suggests that female preference began because the trait
indicated the maleâs quality. The female preference spread, so that the
femalesâ offspring now benefited from the higher quality from specific trait
but also greater attractiveness to mates. Eventually, the trait only represents
attractiveness to mates, and no longer represents increased survival.[9]
An example of mate choice by genes is seen in the cichlid fish Tropheus_moorii
where males provide no parental care. An experiment found that a female T.
moorii is more likely to choose a mate with the same color morph as her own.
[14] In another experiment, females have been shown to share preferences for
the same males when given two to choose from, meaning some males get to
reproduce more often than others.[15]
**** Sensory bias[edit] ****
The sensory bias hypothesis states that the preference for a trait evolves in a
non-mating context, and is then exploited by one sex to obtain more mating
opportunities. The competitive sex evolves traits that exploit a pre-existing
bias that the choosy sex already possesses. This mechanism is thought to
explain remarkable trait differences in closely related species because it
produces a divergence in signaling systems, which leads to reproductive
isolation.[16]
Sensory bias has been demonstrated in guppies, freshwater fish from Trinidad
and_Tobago. In this mating system, female guppies prefer to mate with males
with more orange body coloration. However, outside of a mating context, both
sexes prefer animate orange objects, which suggests that preference originally
evolved in another context, like foraging.[17] Orange fruits are a rare treat
that fall into streams where the guppies live. The ability to find these fruits
quickly is an adaptive quality that has evolved outside of a mating context.
Sometime after the affinity for orange objects arose, male guppies exploited
this preference by incorporating large orange spots to attract females.
Another example of sensory exploitation is in the water mite Neumania
papillator, an ambush_predator that hunts copepods (small crustaceans) passing
by in the water column.[18] When hunting, N. papillator adopts a characteristic
stance termed the 'net stance' - their first four legs are held out into the
water column, with their four hind legs resting on aquatic vegetation; this
allows them to detect vibrational stimuli produced by swimming prey and use
this to orient towards and clutch at prey.[19] During courtship, males actively
search for females[20] - if a male finds a female, he slowly circles around the
female whilst trembling his first and second leg near her.[18][19] Male leg
trembling causes females (who were in the 'net stance') to orient towards often
clutch the male.[18] This did not damage the male or deter further courtship;
the male then deposited spermatophores and began to vigorously fan and jerk his
fourth pair of legs over the spermatophore, generating a current of water that
passed over the spermatophores and towards the female.[18] Sperm packet uptake
by the female would sometimes follow.[18] Heather Proctor hypothesised that the
vibrations trembling male legs made were done to mimic the vibrations that
females detect from swimming prey - this would trigger the female prey-
detection responses causing females to orient and then clutch at males,
mediating courtship.[18][21] If this was true and males were exploiting female
predation responses, then hungry females should be more receptive to male
trembling â Proctor found that unfed captive females did orient and clutch at
males significantly more than fed captive females did, consistent with the
sensory exploitation hypothesis.[18]
Other examples for the sensory bias mechanism include traits in auklets,[22]
wolf_spiders,[23] and manakins.[24] Further experimental work is required to
reach a fuller understanding of the prevalence and mechanisms of sensory bias.
[25]
***** Sexual conflict[edit] *****
Sexual_conflict, in some form or another, may very well be inherent in the ways
most animals reproduce.[26] Females invest more in offspring prior to mating,
due to the differences in gametes in species that exhibit anisogamy, and often
invest more in offspring after mating.[27] This unequal investment leads, on
one hand, to intense competition between males for mates and, on the other
hand, to females choosing among males for better access to resources and good
genes. Because of differences in mating goals, males and females may have very
different preferred outcomes to mating.
Sexual conflict occurs whenever the preferred outcome of mating is different
for the male and female. This difference, in theory, should lead to each sex
evolving adaptations that bias the outcome of reproduction towards its own
interests. This sexual competition leads to sexually antagonistic coevolution
between males and females, resulting in what has been described as an
evolutionary_arms_race between males and females.[28][29]
**** Conflict over mating[edit] ****
Male_scorpionfly
Malesâ reproductive successes are often limited by access to mates, whereas
femalesâ reproductive successes are more often limited by access to
resources. Thus, for a given sexual encounter, it benefits the male to mate,
but benefits the female to be choosy and resist.[27] For example, male small
tortoiseshell butterfly compete to gain the best territory to mate.[30] Another
example of this conflict can be found in the Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa
virginica. Males of this species are limited in reproduction primarily by
access to mates, so they claim a territory and wait for a female to pass
through. Big males are, therefore, more successful in mating because they claim
territories near the female nesting sites that are more sought after. Smaller
males, on the other hand, monopolize less competitive sites in foraging areas
so that they may mate with reduced conflict.[31]
Extreme manifestations of this conflict are seen throughout nature. For
example, the male Panorpa scorpionflies attempt to force copulation. Male
scorpionflies usually acquire mates by presenting them with edible nuptial
gifts in the forms of salivary secretions or dead insects. However, some males
attempt to force copulation by grabbing females with a specialized abdominal
organ without offering a gift.[32] Forced_copulation is costly to the female as
she does not receive the food from the male and has to search for food herself
(costing time and energy), while it is beneficial for the male as he does not
need to find a nuptial gift.
In other cases, however, it pays for the female to gain more matings and her
social mate to prevent these so as to guard paternity. For example, in many
socially monogamous birds, males follow females closely during their fertile
periods and attempt to chase away any other males to prevent extra-pair
matings. The female may attempt to sneak off to achieve these extra matings. In
species where males are incapable of constant guarding, the social male may
frequently copulate with the female so as to swamp rival malesâ sperm.[33]
Female red_junglefowl in Thailand
Sexual conflict after mating has also been shown to occur in both males and
females. Males employ a diverse array of tactics to increase their success in
sperm_competition. These can include removing other maleâs sperm from
females, displacing other maleâs sperm by flushing out prior inseminations
with large amounts of their own sperm, creating copulatory plugs in femalesâ
reproductive tracts to prevent future matings with other males, spraying
females with anti-aphrodisiacs to discourage other males from mating with the
female, and producing sterile parasperm to protect fertile eusperm in the
femaleâs reproductive tract.[27] For example, the male spruce bud moth
(Zeiraphera_canadensis) secretes an accessory gland protein during mating that
makes them unattractive to other males and thus prevents females from future
copulation.[34] The Rocky_Mountain_parnassian also exhibits this type of sexual
conflict when the male butterflies deposit a waxy genital plug onto the tip of
the female's abdomen that physically prevents the female from mating again.[35]
Males can also prevent future mating by transferring an anti-Aphrodiasic to the
female during mating. This behavior is seen in butterfly species such as
Heliconius_mepomene, where males transfer a compound that causes the female to
smell like a male butterfly and thus deter any future potential mates.[36]
Furthermore, males may control the strategic allocation of sperm, producing
more sperm when females are more promiscuous. All these methods are meant to
ensure that females are more likely to produce offspring belonging to the males
who uses the method.[27]
Females also control the outcomes of matings, and there exists the possibility
that females choose sperm (cryptic female choice).[27] A dramatic example of
this is the feral fowl Gallus_gallus. In this species, females prefer to
copulate with dominant males, but subordinate males can force matings. In these
cases, the female is able to eject the subordinate maleâs sperm using cloacal
contractions.[37]
***** Parental care and family conflicts[edit] *****
Parental_care is the investment a parent puts into their offspringâwhich
includes protecting and feeding the young, preparing burrows or nests, and
providing eggs with yolk.[38] There is great variation in parental care in the
animal kingdom. In some species, the parents may not care for their offspring
at all, while in others the parents exhibit single-parental or even bi-parental
care. As with other topics in behavioral ecology, interactions within a family
involve conflicts. These conflicts can be broken down into three general types:
sexual (male-female) conflict, parent-offspring conflict, and sibling conflict.
**** Types of parental care[edit] ****
There are many different patterns of parental_care in the animal kingdom. The
patterns can be explained by physiological constraints or ecological
conditions, such as mating opportunities. In invertebrates, there is no
parental care in most species because it is more favorable for parents to
produce a large number of eggs whose fate is left to chance than to protect a
few individual young. For example, female L._figueresi die after stocking their
larvae's cells with pollen and nectar and before their larvae hatch.[39] In
birds, biparental care is the most common, because reproductive success
directly depends on the parents' ability to feed their chicks. Two parents can
feed twice as many young, so it is more favorable for birds to have both
parents delivering food. In mammals, female-only care is the most common. This
is most likely because females are internally fertilized and so are holding the
young inside for a prolonged period of gestation, which provides males with the
opportunity to desert. Females also feed the young through lactation after
birth, so males are not required for feeding. Male parental care is only
observed in species where they contribute to feeding or carrying of the young,
such as in marmosets.[40] In fish there is no parental care in 79% of bony
fish.[41] In fish with parental care, it usually limited to selecting,
preparing, and defending a nest, as seen in sockeye_salmon, for example.[42]
Also, parental care in fish, if any, is primarily done by males, as seen in
gobies and redlip_blennies.[43][38] The cichlid fish V._moorii exhibits
biparental care.[44] In species with internal fertilization, the female is
usually the one to take care of the young. In cases where fertilization is
external the male becomes the main caretaker.
**** Familial conflict[edit] ****
Familial conflict is a result of trade-offs as a function of lifetime parental
investment. Parental investment was defined by Robert_Trivers in 1972 as âany
investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the
offspring's chance of surviving at the cost of the parentâs ability to invest
in other offspringâ.[citation_needed] Parental investment includes behaviors
like guarding and feeding. Each parent has a limited amount of parental
investment over the course of their lifetime. Investment trade-offs in
offspring quality and quantity within a brood and trade offs between current
and future broods leads to conflict over how much parental investment to
provide and to whom parents should invest in. There are three major types of
familial conflict: sexual, parent-offspring, and sibling-sibling conflict.[9]
*** Sexual conflict[edit] ***
Main article: Sexual_conflict
Great tit
There is conflict among parents as to who should provide the care as well as
how much care to provide. Each parent must decide whether or not to stay and
care for their offspring, or to desert their offspring. This decision is best
modeled by game_theoretic approaches to evolutionarily_stable_strategies (ESS)
where the best strategy for one parent depends on the strategy adopted by the
other parent. Recent research has found response matching in parents who
determine how much care to invest in their offspring. Studies found that parent
great_tits match their partnerâs increased care-giving efforts with increased
provisioning rates of their own.[45] This cued parental response is a type of
behavioral negotiation between parents that leads to stabilized compensation.
*** Parent-offspring conflict[edit] ***
Blackbird chicks in a nest
According to Robert_Triversâs theory on relatedness,[citation_needed] each
offspring is related to itself by 1, but is only 0.5 related to their parents
and siblings. Genetically, offspring are predisposed to behave in their own
self-interest while parents are predisposed to behave equally to all their
offspring, including both current and future ones. Offspring selfishly try to
take more than their fair shares of parental_investment, while parents try to
spread out their parental investment equally amongst their present young and
future young. There are many examples of parent-offspring conflict in nature.
One manifestation of this is asynchronous hatching in birds. A behavioral
ecology hypothesis is known as Lack's brood reduction hypothesis (named after
David_Lack).[citation_needed] Lack's hypothesis posits an evolutionary and
ecological explanation as to why birds lay a series of eggs with an
asynchronous delay leading to nestlings of mixed age and weights. According to
Lack, this brood behavior is an ecological insurance that allows the larger
birds to survive in poor years and all birds to survive when food is plentiful.
[46][47] We also see sex-ratio conflict between the queen and her workers in
social hymenoptera. Because of haplodiploidy, the workers (offspring) prefer a
3:1 female to male sex allocation while the queen prefers a 1:1 sex ratio. Both
the queen and the workers try to bias the sex ratio in their favor.[48] In some
species, the workers gain control of the sex ratio, while in other species,
like B._terrestris, the queen has a considerable amount of control over the
colony sex ratio.[49] Lastly, there has been recent evidence regarding genomic
imprinting that is a result of parent-offspring conflict. Paternal genes in
offspring demand more maternal resources than maternal genes in the same
offspring and vice versa. This has been show in imprinted genes like insulin-
like_growth_factor-II.[50]
*** Parent-offspring conflict resolution[edit] ***
Parents need an honest signal from their offspring that indicates their level
of hunger or need, so that the parents can distribute resources accordingly.
Offspring want more than their fair share of resources, so they exaggerate
their signals to wheedle more parental investment. However, this conflict is
countered by the cost of excessive begging. Not only does excessive begging
attract predators, but it also retards chick growth if begging goes unrewarded.
[51] Thus, the cost of increased begging enforces offspring honesty.
Another resolution for parent-offspring conflict is that parental provisioning
and offspring demand have actually coevolved, so that there is no obvious
underlying conflict. Cross-fostering experiments in great_tits (Parus major)
have shown that offspring beg more when their biological mothers are more
generous.[52] Therefore, it seems that the willingness to invest in offspring
is co-adapted to offspring demand.
*** Sibling-sibling conflict[edit] ***
GalÃ¡pagos fur seals
The lifetime parental_investment is the fixed amount of parental resources
available for all of a parent's young, and an offspring wants as much of it as
possible. Siblings in a brood often compete for parental resources by trying to
gain more than their fair share of what their parents can offer. Nature
provides numerous examples in which sibling rivalry escalates to such an
extreme that one sibling tries to kill off broodmates to maximize parental
investment (See Siblicide). In the GalÃ¡pagos_fur_seal, the second pup of a
female is usually born when the first pup is still suckling. This competition
for the mother's milk is especially fierce during periods of food shortage such
as an El_NiÃ±o year, and this usually results in the older pup directly
attacking and killing the younger one.[53]
In some bird species, sibling rivalry is also abetted by the asynchronous
hatching of eggs. In the blue-footed_booby, for example, the first egg in a
nest is hatched four days before the second one, resulting in the elder chick
having a four-day head start in growth. When the elder chick falls 20-25% below
its expected weight threshold, it attacks its younger sibling and drives it
from the nest.[54]
Sibling relatedness in a brood also influences the level of sibling-sibling
conflict. In a study on passerine birds, it was found that chicks begged more
loudly in species with higher levels of extra-pair_paternity.[55]
**** Brood parasitism[edit] ****
Main article: Brood_parasite
Adult reed_warbler feeding a common cuckoo chick
Some animals deceive_other_species into providing all parental care. These
brood parasites selfishly exploit their hosts' parents and host offspring. The
common_cuckoo is a well known example of a brood parasite. Female cuckoos lay a
single egg in the nest of the host species and when the cuckoo chick hatches,
it ejects all the host eggs and young. Other examples of brood parasites
include honeyguides, cowbirds, and the large_blue_butterfly.[56][57][58] Brood
parasite offspring have many strategies to induce their host parents to invest
parental care. Studies show that the common cuckoo uses vocal mimicry to
reproduce the sound of multiple hungry host young to solicit more food.[59]
Other cuckoos use visual deception with their wings to exaggerate the begging
display. False gapes from brood parasite offspring cause host parents to
collect more food.[60] Another example of a brood parasite is Phengaris
butterflies such as Phengaris_rebeli and Phengaris_arion, which differ from the
cuckoo in that the butterflies do not oviposit directly in the nest of the
host, an ant species Myrmica_schencki.[61][62] Rather, the butterfly larvae
release chemicals that deceive the ants into believing that they are ant
larvae, causing the ants to bring the butterfly larvae back to their own nests
to feed them.[61][62] Other examples of brood parasites are Polistes_sulcifer,
a paper wasp that has lost the ability to build its own nests so females lay
their eggs in the nest of a host species, Polistes_dominula, and rely on the
host workers to take care of their brood,[63] as well as Bombus_bohemicus, a
bumblebee that relies on host workers of various other Bombus species.[64]
Similarly, in Eulaema_meriana, some Leucospidae wasps exploit the brood cells
and nest for shelter and food from the bees.[65][66] Vespula_austriaca is
another wasp in which the females force the host workers to feed and take care
of the brood.[67] In particular, Bombus_hyperboreus, an Arctic bee species, is
also classified as a brood parasite in that it attacks and enslaves other
species within their subgenus, Alpinobombus to propagate their population.[68]
***** Mating systems[edit] *****
Main article: Mating_systems
Various types of mating systems include monogamy, polygyny, polyandry,
promiscuity, and polygamy. Each is differentiated by the sexual behavior
between mates, such as which males mate with certain females. An influential
paper by Stephen Emlen and Lewis Oring (1977)[69] argued that two main factors
of animal behavior influence the diversity of mating systems: the relative
accessibility that each sex has to mates, and the parental desertion by either
sex.
**** Mating systems with no male parental care[edit] ****
In a system that does not have male parental care, resource dispersion,
predation, and the effects of social_living primarily influence female
dispersion, which in turn influences male dispersion. Since males' primary
concern is female acquisition, the males either indirectly or directly compete
for the females. In direct competition, the males are directly focused on the
females.[70] Blue-headed_wrasse demonstrate the behavior in which females
follow resourcesâsuch as good nest sitesâand males follow the females.[70]
[71] Conversely, species with males that exemplify indirectly competitive
behavior tend towards the malesâ anticipation of the resources desired by
females and their subsequent effort to control or acquire these resources,
which helps them to achieve success with females.[70] Grey-sided voles
demonstrate indirect male competition for females. The males were
experimentally observed to home in on the sites with the best food in
anticipation of females settling in these areas.[70][72] Males of Euglossa
imperialis, a non-social bee species, also demonstrate indirect competitive
behavior by forming aggregations of territories, which can be considered leks,
to defend fragrant-rich primary territories. The purpose of these aggregations
is largely only facultative, since the more suitable fragrant-rich sites there
are, the more habitable territories there are to inhabit, giving females of
this species a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate.[73] Leks
and choruses have also been deemed another behavior among the phenomena of male
competition for females. Due to the resource-poor nature of the territories
that lekking males often defend, it is difficult to categorize them as indirect
competitors. For example, the ghost_moth males display in leks to attract a
female mate. Additionally, it is difficult to classify them as direct
competitors seeing as they put a great deal of effort into their defense of
their territories before females arrive, and upon female arrival they put for
the great mating displays to attract the females to their individual sites.
These observations make it difficult to determine whether female or resource
dispersion primarily influences male aggregation, especially in lieu of the
apparent difficulty that males may have defending resources and females in such
densely populated areas.[70] Because the reason for male aggregation into leks
is unclear, five hypotheses have been proposed. These postulates propose the
following as reasons for male lekking: hotspot, predation reduction, increased
female attraction, hotshot males, facilitation of female choice.[70][74] With
all of the mating behaviors discussed, the primary factors influencing
differences within and between species are ecology, social conflicts, and life
history differences.[70]
In some other instances, neither direct nor indirect competition is seen.
Instead, in species like the Edith's_checkerspot butterfly, males' efforts are
directed at acquisition of females and they exhibit indiscriminate mate
location behavior, where, given the low cost of mistakes, they blindly attempt
to mate both correctly with females and incorrectly with other objects.[75]
**** Mating systems with male parental care[edit] ****
*** Monogamy[edit] ***
Monogamy is the mating system in 90% of birds, possibly because each male and
female has a greater number of offspring if they share in raising a brood.[76]
In obligate monogamy, males feed females on the nest, or share in incubation
and chick-feeding. In some species, males and females form lifelong pair bonds.
Monogamy may also arise from limited opportunities for polygamy, due to strong
competition among males for mates, females suffering from loss of male help,
and female-female aggression.[77]
*** Polygyny[edit] ***
In birds, polygyny occurs when males indirectly monopolize females by
controlling resources. In species where males normally do not contribute much
to parental care, females suffer relatively little or not at all.[78] In other
species, however, females suffer through the loss of male contribution, and the
cost of having to share resources that the male controls, such as nest sites or
food. In some cases, a polygynous male may control a high-quality territory so
for the female, the benefits of polygyny may outweigh the costs.[79]
*** Polyandry threshold[edit] ***
There also seems to be a âpolyandry thresholdâ where males may do better by
agreeing to share a female instead of maintaining a monogamous mating system.
[80] Situations that may lead to cooperation among males include when food is
scarce, and when there is intense competition for territories or females. For
example, male lions sometimes form coalitions to gain control of a pride of
females. In some populations of Galapagos_hawks, groups of males would
cooperate to defend one breeding territory. The males would share matings with
the female and share paternity with the offspring.[81]
*** Female desertion and sex role reversal[edit] ***
In birds, desertion often happens when food is abundant, so the remaining
partner is better able to raise the young unaided. Desertion also occurs if
there is a great chance of a parent to gain another mate, which depends on
environmental and populational factors.[82] Some birds, such as the phalaropes,
have reversed sex roles where the female is larger and more brightly colored,
and compete for males to incubate their clutches.[83] In jacanas, the female is
larger than the male and her territory could overlap the multiple territories
of up to four males.[84]
***** Social behaviors[edit] *****
Animals cooperate with each other to increase their own fitness.[85] These
altruistic, and sometimes spiteful behaviors can be explained by Hamilton's
rule, which states that rB-C > 0 where r= relatedness, B= benefits, and C=
costs.[86]
**** Kin selection[edit] ****
Main article: Kin_selection
Kin selection refers to evolutionary strategies where an individual acts to
favor the reproductive_success of relatives, or kin, even if the action incurs
some cost to the organism's own survival and ability to procreate.[85] John
Maynard_Smith coined the term in 1964,[87] although the concept was referred to
by Charles_Darwin who cited that helping relatives would be favored by group
selection. Mathematical descriptions of kin selection were initially offered by
R._A._Fisher in 1930[88] and J._B._S._Haldane in 1932.[89] and 1955.[90] W._D.
Hamilton popularized the concept later, including the mathematical treatment by
George_Price in 1963 and 1964.[91][92]
Kin selection predicts that individuals will harbor personal costs in favor of
one or multiple individuals because this can maximize their genetic
contribution to future generations. For example, an organism may be inclined to
expend great time and energy in parental_investment to rear offspring since
this future generation may be better suited for propagating genes that are
highly shared between the parent and offspring.[85] Ultimately, the initial
actor performs apparent altruistic actions for kin to enhance its own
reproductive fitness. In particular, organisms are hypothesized to act in favor
of kin depending on their genetic relatedness.[91][92] So, individuals are
inclined to act altruistically for siblings, grandparents, cousins, and other
relatives, but to differing degrees.[85]
*** Inclusive fitness[edit] ***
Inclusive_fitness describes the component of reproductive success in both a
focal individual and their relatives.[85] Importantly, the measure embodies the
sum of direct and indirect fitness and the change in their reproductive success
based on the actor's behavior.[93] That is, the effect an individual's
behaviors have on: being personally better-suited to reproduce offspring, and
aiding descendent and non-descendent relatives in their reproductive efforts.
[85] Natural_selection is predicted to push individuals to behave in ways that
maximize their inclusive fitness. Studying inclusive fitness is often done
using predictions from Hamilton's rule.
**** Kin recognition[edit] ****
Main article: Kin_recognition
*** Genetic cues[edit] ***
One possible method of kin selection is based on genetic cues that can be
recognized phenotypically.[9] Genetic recognition has been exemplified in a
species that is usually not thought of as a social creature: amoebae. Social
amoebae form fruiting bodies when starved for food. These amoebae
preferentially formed slugs and fruiting bodies with members of their own
lineage, which is clonially related.[94] The genetic cue comes from variable
lag genes, which are involved in signaling and adhesion between cells.[95]
Kin can also be recognized a genetically determined odor, as studied in the
primitively social sweat bee, Lasioglossum_zephyrum. These bees can even
recognize relatives they have never met and roughly determine relatedness.[96]
The Brazilian stingless bee Schwarziana_quadripunctata uses a distinct
combination of chemical hydrocarbons to recognize and locate kin. Each chemical
odor, emitted from the organism's epicuticles, is unique and varies according
to age, sex, location, and hierarchical position.[97] Similarly, individuals of
the stingless bee species Trigona_fulviventris can distinguish kin from non-kin
through recognition of a number of compounds, including hydrocarbons and fatty
acids that are present in their wax and floral oils from plants used to
construct their nests.[98] In the species, Osmia_rufa, kin selection has also
been associated with mating selection. Females, specifically, select males for
mating with whom they are genetically more related to.[99]
*** Environmental cues[edit] ***
There are two simple rules that animals follow to determine who is kin. These
rules can be exploited, but exist because they are generally successful.
The first rule is âtreat anyone in my home as kin.â This rule is readily
seen in the reed_warbler, a bird species that only focuses on chicks in their
own nest. If its own kin is placed outside of the nest, a parent bird ignores
that chick. This rule can sometimes lead to odd results, especially if there is
a parasitic bird that lays eggs in the reed warbler nest. For example, an adult
cuckoo may sneak its egg into the nest. Once the cuckoo hatches, the reed
warbler parent feeds the invading bird like its own child. Even with the risk
for exploitation, the rule generally proves successful.[9][100]
The second rule, named by Konrad_Lorenz as âimprinting,â states that those
who you grow up with are kin. Several species exhibit this behavior, including,
but not limited to the Belding's_ground_squirrel.[9] Experimentation with these
squirrels showed that regardless of true genetic relatedness, those that were
reared together rarely fought. Further research suggests that there is
partially some genetic recognition going on as well, as siblings that were
raised apart were less aggressive toward one another compared to non-relatives
reared apart.[101]
**** Cooperation[edit] ****
Cooperation is broadly defined as behavior that provides a benefit to another
individual that specifically evolved for that benefit. This excludes behavior
that has not been expressly selected for to provide a benefit for another
individual, because there are many commensal and parasitic relationships where
the behavior one individual (which has evolved to benefit that individual and
no others) is taken advantage of by other organisms. Stable cooperative
behavior requires that it provide a benefit to both the actor and recipient,
though the benefit to the actor can take many different forms.[9]
*** Within species[edit] ***
Within species cooperation occurs among members of the same species. Examples
of intraspecific cooperation include cooperative breeding (such as in weeper
capuchins) and cooperative foraging (such as in wolves). There are also forms
of cooperative defense mechanisms, such as the "fighting swarm" behavior used
by the stingless bee Tetragonula_carbonaria.[102] Much of this behavior occurs
due to kin selection. Kin selection allows cooperative behavior to evolve where
the actor receives no direct benefits from the cooperation.[9]
Cooperation (without kin selection) must evolve to provide benefits to both the
actor and recipient of the behavior. This includes reciprocity, where the
recipient of the cooperative behavior repays the actor at a later time. This
may occur in vampire bats but it is uncommon in non-human animals.[103]
Cooperation can occur willingly between individuals when both benefit directly
as well. Cooperative breeding, where one individual cares for the offspring of
another, occurs in several species, including wedge-capped_capuchin monkeys.
[104]
Cooperative behavior may also be enforced, where their failure to cooperate
results in negative consequences. One of the best examples of this is worker
policing, which occurs in social insect colonies.[105]
The cooperative_pulling_paradigm is a popular experimental design used to
assess if and under which conditions animals cooperate. It involves two or more
animals pulling rewards towards themselves via an apparatus they can not
successfully operate alone.[106]
*** Between species[edit] ***
Cooperation can occur between members of different species. For interspecific
cooperation to be evolutionarily stable, it must benefit individuals in both
species. Examples include pistol shrimp and goby fish, nitrogen fixing microbes
and legumes,[107] ants and aphids.[108] In ants and aphids, aphids secrete a
sugary liquid called honeydew, which ants eat. The ants provide protection to
the aphids against predators, and, in some instances, raise the aphid eggs and
larvae inside the ant colony. This behavior is analogous to human
domestication.[108] The genus of goby fish, Elacatinus also demonstrate
cooperation by removing and feeding on ectoparasites of their clients.[109] The
species of wasp Polybia_rejecta and ants Azteca chartifex show a cooperative
behavior protecting one another's nests from predators.
Market economics often govern the details of the cooperation: e.g. the amount
exchanged between individual animals follow the rules of supply_and_demand.
[110]
**** Spite[edit] ****
Hamilton's_rule can also predict spiteful behaviors between non-relatives.[9] A
spiteful behavior is one that is harmful to both the actor and to the
recipient. Spiteful behavior is favored if the actor is less related to the
recipient than to the average member of the population making r negative and if
rB-C is still greater than zero. Spite can also be thought of as a type of
altruism because harming a non-relative, by taking his resources for example,
could also benefit a relative, by allowing him access to those resources.
Furthermore, certain spiteful behaviors may provide harmful short term
consequences to the actor but also give long term reproductive benefits.[111]
Many behaviors that are commonly thought of as spiteful are actually better
explained as being selfish, that is benefiting the actor and harming the
recipient, and true spiteful behaviors are rare in the animal kingdom.
An example of spite is the sterile soldiers of the polyembryonic parasitoid
wasp. A female wasp lays a male and a female egg in a caterpillar. The eggs
divide asexually, creating many genetically identical male and female larvae.
Sterile soldier wasps also develop and attack the relatively unrelated brother
larvae so that the genetically identical sisters have more access to food.[9]
Another example is bacteria that release bacteriocins.[9] The bacteria that
releases the bacteriocin may have to die to do so, but most of the harm is to
unrelated individuals who are killed by the bacteriocin. This is because the
ability to produce and release the bacteriocin is linked to an immunity to it.
Therefore, close relatives to the releasing cell are less likely to die than
non-relatives.
***** Altruism and conflict in social insects[edit] *****
Honeypot ant
Many insect species of the order Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps) are eusocial.
Within the nests or hives of social insects, individuals engage in specialized
tasks to ensure the survival of the colony. Dramatic examples of these
specializations include changes in body morphology or unique behaviors, such as
the engorged bodies of the honeypot_ant Myrmecocystus mexicanus or the waggle
dance of honey bees and a wasp species, Vespula_vulgaris.
In many, but not all social insects, reproduction is monopolized by the queen
of the colony. Due to the effects of a haplodiploid mating system, in which
unfertilized eggs become male drones and fertilized eggs become worker females,
average relatedness values between sister workers can be higher than those seen
in humans or other eutherian mammals. This has led to the suggestion that kin
selection may be a driving force in the evolution of eusociality, as
individuals could provide cooperative care that establishes a favorable benefit
to cost ratio (rB-c_>_0).[112] However, not all social insects follow this
rule. In the social wasp Polistes dominula, 35% of the nest mates are
unrelated.[30][54] In many other species, unrelated individuals only help the
queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for
unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other social insect
submits to unrelated queens in this way. This seemingly unfavorable behavior
parallels some vertebrate systems. It is thought that this unrelated assistance
is evidence of altruism in P. dominula.[30]
Naked mole-rats
Cooperation in social organisms has numerous ecological factors that can
determine the benefits and costs associated with this form of organization. One
suggested benefit is a type of "life insurance" for individuals who participate
in the care of the young. In this instance, individuals may have a greater
likelihood of transmitting genes to the next generation when helping in a group
compared to individual reproduction. Another suggested benefit is the
possibility of "fortress defense", where soldier castes threaten or attack
intruders, thus protecting related individuals inside the territory. Such
behaviors are seen in the snapping shrimp Synalpheus_regalis and gall-forming
aphid Pemphigus_spyrothecae.[113][114] A third ecological factor that is
posited to promote eusociality is the distribution of resources: when food is
sparse and concentrated in patches, eusociality is favored. Evidence supporting
this third factor comes from studies of naked_mole-rats and Damaraland_mole-
rats, which have communities containing a single pair of reproductive
individuals.[115]
**** Conflicts in social insects[edit] ****
Although eusociality has been shown to offer many benefits to the colony, there
is also potential for conflict. Examples include the sex-ratio conflict and
worker_policing seen in certain species of social Hymenoptera such as
Dolichovespula_media, Dolichovespula_sylvestris, Dolichovespula_norwegica[116]
and Vespula_vulgaris.[117][118] The queen and the worker wasps either
indirectly kill the laying-workers' offspring by neglecting them or directly
condemn them by cannibalizing and scavenging.[119]
The sex-ratio conflict arises from a relatedness asymmetry, which is caused by
the haplodiploidy nature of Hymenoptera. For instance, workers are most related
to each other because they share half of the genes from the queen and inherit
all of the fatherâs genes. Their total relatedness to each other would be
0.5+ (0.5 x 0.5) = 0.75. Thus, sisters are three-fourths related to each other.
On the other hand, males arise from unfertilized larva, meaning they only
inherit half of the queenâs genes and none from the father. As a result, a
female is related to her brother by 0.25, because 50% of her genes that come
from her father have no chance of being shared with a brother. Her relatedness
to her brother would therefore be 0.5 x 0.5=0.25.[9]:382
According to Trivers and Hareâs population-level sex-investment ratio theory,
the ratio of relatedness between sexes determines the sex investment ratios.
[120] As a result, it has been observed that there is a tug-of-war between the
queen and the workers, where the queen would prefer a 1:1 female to male ratio
because she is equally related to her sons and daughters (r=0.5 in each case).
However, the workers would prefer a 3:1 female to male ratio because they are
0.75 related to each other and only 0.25 related to their brothers.[9]:382
Allozyme data of a colony may indicate who wins this conflict.[121]
Conflict can also arise between workers in colonies of social insects. In some
species, worker females retain their ability to mate and lay eggs. The colony's
queen is related to her sons by half of her genes and a quarter to the sons of
her worker daughters. Workers, however, are related to their sons by half of
their genes and to their brothers by a quarter. Thus, the queen and her worker
daughters would compete for reproduction to maximize their own reproductive
fitness. Worker reproduction is limited by other workers who are more related
to the queen than their sisters, a situation occurring in many polyandrous
hymenopteran species. Workers police the egg-laying females by engaging in
oophagy or directed acts of aggression.[122][123]
**** The monogamy hypothesis[edit] ****
The monogamy hypothesis states that the presence of monogamy in insects is
crucial for eusociality to occur. This is thought to be true because of
Hamiltonâs rule that states that rB-C>0. By having a monogamous mating
system, all of the offspring have high relatedness to each other. This means
that it is equally beneficial to help out a sibling, as it is to help out an
offspring. If there were many fathers the relatedness of the colony would be
lowered.[9]:371â375
This monogamous mating system has been observed in insects such as termites,
ants, bees and wasps.[9]:371â375 In termites the queen commits to a single
male when founding a nest. In ants, bees and wasps the queens have a functional
equivalent to lifetime monogamy. The male can even die before the founding of
the colony. The queen can store and use the sperm from a single male throughout
their lifetime, sometimes up to 30 years.[9]:371â375
In an experiment looking at the mating of 267 hymenopteran species, the results
were mapped onto a phylogeny. It was found that monogamy was the ancestral
state in all the independent transitions to eusociality. This indicates that
monogamy is the ancestral, likely to be crucial state for the development of
eusociality. In species where queens mated with multiple mates, it was found
that these were developed from lineages where sterile castes already evolved,
so the multiple mating was secondary.[124] In these cases, multiple mating is
likely to be advantageous for reasons other than those important at the origin
of eusociality. Most likely reasons are that a diverse worker pool attained by
multiple mating by the queen increases disease resistance and may facilitate a
division of labor among workers[9]:371â375
***** Communication and signaling[edit] *****
Main article: Animal_communication
Communication is varied at all scales of life, from interactions between
microscopic organisms to those of large groups of people. Nevertheless, the
signals used in communication abide by a fundamental property: they must be a
quality of the receiver that can transfer information to a receiver that is
capable of interpreting the signal and modifying its behavior accordingly.
Signals are distinct from cues in that evolution has selected for signalling
between both parties, whereas cues are merely informative to the observer and
may not have originally been used for the intended purpose. The natural world
is replete with examples of signals, from the luminescent flashes of light from
fireflies, to chemical signaling in red_harvester_ants to prominent mating
displays of birds such as the Guianan_cock-of-the-rock, which gather in leks,
the pheromones released by the corn_earworm_moth,[125] the dancing patterns of
the blue-footed_booby, or the alarm sound Synoeca_cyanea make by rubbing their
mandibles against their nest.[126] Yet other examples are the cases of the
grizzled_skipper and Spodoptera_littoralis where pheromones are released as a
sexual recognition mechanism that drives evolution.[127][128]
The nature of communication poses evolutionary concerns, such as the potential
for deceit or manipulation on the part of the sender. In this situation, the
receiver must be able to anticipate the interests of the sender and act
appropriately to a given signal. Should any side gain advantage in the short
term, evolution would select against the signal or the response. The conflict
of interests between the sender and the receiver results in an evolutionarily
stable state only if both sides can derive an overall benefit.
Although the potential benefits of deceit could be great in terms of mating
success, there are several possibilities for how dishonesty is controlled,
which include indices, handicaps, and common interests. Indices are reliable
indicators of a desirable quality, such as overall health, fertility, or
fighting ability of the organism. Handicaps, as the term suggests, place a
restrictive cost on the organisms that own them, and thus lower quality
competitors experience a greater relative cost compared to their higher quality
counterparts. In the common interest situation, it is beneficial to both sender
and receiver to communicate honestly such that the benefit of the interaction
is maximized.
Signals are often honest, but there are exceptions. Prime examples of dishonest
signals include the luminescent lure of the anglerfish, which is used to
attract prey, or the mimicry of non-poisonous butterfly species, like the
Batesian mimic Papilio_polyxenes of the poisonous model Battus_philenor.[129]
Although evolution should normally favor selection against the dishonest
signal, in these cases it appears that the receiver would benefit more on
average by accepting the signal.
