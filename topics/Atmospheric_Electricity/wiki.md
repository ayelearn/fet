Electricity in planetary atmospheres
Cloud to ground lightning. Typically, lightning discharges 30,000 amperes, at
up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, x-rays and even gamma
rays.[1] Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000 kelvins.
Atmospheric electricity is the study of electrical_charges in the Earth's
atmosphere (or that of another planet). The movement of charge between the
Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and the ionosphere is known as the global
atmospheric_electrical_circuit. Atmospheric electricity is an interdisciplinary
topic with a long history, involving concepts from electrostatics, atmospheric
physics, meteorology and Earth_science.[2]
Thunderstorms act as a giant battery in the atmosphere, charging up the
ionosphere to about 400,000 volts with respect to the surface. This sets up an
electric field throughout the atmosphere, which decreases with increase in
altitude. Atmospheric ions created by cosmic rays and natural radioactivity
move in the electric field, so a very small current flows through the
atmosphere, even away from thunderstorms. Near the surface of the earth, the
magnitude of the field is on average around 100 V/m.[3]
Atmospheric electricity involves both thunderstorms, which create lightning
bolts to rapidly discharge huge amounts of atmospheric charge stored in storm
clouds, and the continual electrification of the air due to ionization from
cosmic_rays and natural_radioactivity, which ensure that the atmosphere is
never quite neutral.[4]

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_electromagnetic_theory
Sparks drawn from electrical machines and from Leyden_jars suggested to the
early experimenters, Hauksbee, Newton, Wall, Nollet, and Gray, that lightning
was caused by electric discharges. In 1708, Dr. William_Wall was one of the
first to observe that spark discharges resembled miniature lightning, after
observing the sparks from a charged piece of amber.
Benjamin_Franklin's experiments showed that electrical phenomena of the
atmosphere were not fundamentally different from those produced in the
laboratory, by listing many similarities between electricity and lightning. By
1749, Franklin observed lightning to possess almost all the properties
observable in electrical machines.
In July 1750, Franklin hypothesized that electricity could be taken from clouds
via a tall metal aerial with a sharp point. Before Franklin could carry out his
experiment, in 1752 Thomas-FranÃ§ois_Dalibard erected a 40-foot (12 m) iron rod
at Marly-la-Ville, near Paris, drawing sparks from a passing cloud. With
ground-insulated aerials, an experimenter could bring a grounded lead with an
insulated wax handle close to the aerial, and observe a spark discharge from
the aerial to the grounding wire. In May 1752, Dalibard affirmed that
Franklin's theory was correct.
Around June 1752, Franklin reportedly performed his famous kite experiment. The
kite experiment was repeated by Romas, who drew from a metallic string sparks 9
feet (2.7 m) long, and by Cavallo, who made many important observations on
atmospheric electricity. Lemonnier (1752) also reproduced Franklin's experiment
with an aerial, but substituted the ground wire with some dust particles
(testing attraction). He went on to document the fair_weather_condition, the
clear-day electrification of the atmosphere, and its diurnal variation.
Beccaria (1775) confirmed Lemonnier's diurnal variation data and determined
that the atmosphere's charge polarity was positive in fair weather. Saussure
(1779) recorded data relating to a conductor's induced charge in the
atmosphere. Saussure's instrument (which contained two small spheres suspended
in parallel with two thin wires) was a precursor to the electrometer. Saussure
found that the atmospheric electrification under clear weather conditions had
an annual variation, and that it also varied with height. In 1785, Coulomb
discovered the electrical conductivity of air. His discovery was contrary to
the prevailing thought at the time, that the atmospheric gases were insulators
(which they are to some extent, or at least not very good conductors when not
ionized). Erman (1804) theorized that the Earth was negatively charged, and
Peltier (1842) tested and confirmed Erman's idea.
Several researchers contributed to the growing body of knowledge about
atmospheric electrical phenomena. Francis_Ronalds began observing the potential
gradient and air-earth currents around 1810, including making continuous
automated_recordings.[5] He resumed his research in the 1840s as the inaugural
Honorary Director of the Kew_Observatory, where the first extended and
comprehensive dataset of electrical and associated meteorological parameters
was created. He also supplied his equipment to other facilities around the
world with the goal of delineating atmospheric electricity on a global scale.
[6] Kelvin's new water dropper collector and divided-ring electrometer [7] were
introduced at Kew Observatory in the 1860s, and atmospheric electricity
remained a speciality of the observatory until its closure. For high-altitude
measurements, kites were once used, and weather balloons or aerostats are still
used, to lift experimental equipment into the air. Early experimenters even
went aloft themselves in hot-air_balloons.
Hoffert (1888) identified individual lightning downward strokes using early
cameras.[8] Elster and Geitel, who also worked on thermionic_emission, proposed
a theory to explain thunderstorms' electrical structure (1885) and, later,
discovered atmospheric radioactivity (1899) from the existence of positive and
negative ions in the atmosphere.[9] Pockels (1897) estimated lightning current
intensity by analyzing lightning flashes in basalt (c. 1900)[10] and studying
the left-over magnetic_fields caused by lightning.[11] Discoveries about the
electrification of the atmosphere via sensitive electrical instruments and
ideas on how the Earth's negative charge is maintained were developed mainly in
the 20th century, with CTR_Wilson playing an important part.[12][13] Current
research on atmospheric electricity focuses mainly on lightning, particularly
high-energy particles and transient luminous events, and the role of non-
thunderstorm electrical processes in weather and climate.
***** Description[edit] *****
Atmospheric electricity is always present, and during fine weather away from
thunderstorms, the air above the surface of Earth is positively charged, while
the Earth's surface charge is negative. It can be understood in terms of a
difference_of_potential between a point of the Earth's surface, and a point
somewhere in the air above it. Because the atmospheric electric field is
negatively directed in fair weather, the convention is to refer to the
potential gradient, which has the opposite sign and is about 100V/m at the
surface. The potential gradient in most locations is much lower than this value
because it is an average of the charge built up by every thunderstorm and
atmospheric disturbance around the globe.[4] There is a weak conduction current
of atmospheric ions moving in the atmospheric electric field, about 2
picoAmperes per square metre, and the air is weakly conductive due to the
presence of these atmospheric ions.
**** Variations[edit] ****
Global daily cycles in the atmospheric electric field, with a minimum around 03
UT and peaking roughly 16 hours later, were researched by the Carnegie
Institution of Washington in the 20th century. This Carnegie_curve[14]
variation has been described as "the fundamental electrical heartbeat of the
planet".[15]
Even away from thunderstorms, atmospheric electricity can be highly variable,
but, generally, the electric field is enhanced in fogs and dust whereas the
atmospheric electrical conductivity is diminished.
**** Near space[edit] ****
The electrosphere layer (from tens of kilometers above the surface of the earth
to the ionosphere) has a high electrical conductivity and is essentially at a
constant electric potential. The ionosphere is the inner edge of the
magnetosphere and is the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar
radiation. (Photoionization is a physical process in which a photon is incident
on an atom, ion or molecule, resulting in the ejection of one or more
electrons.)[16]
**** Cosmic radiation[edit] ****
Main articles: Background_radiation and Cosmic_ray
The Earth, and almost all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by
radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively
charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside our
solar_system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create
an air_shower of secondary ionising radiation, including X-rays, muons,
protons, alpha_particles, pions, and electrons. Ionization from this secondary
radiation ensures that the atmosphere is weakly conductive, and that the slight
current flow from these ions over the Earth's surface balances the current flow
from thunderstorms.[3] Ions have characteristic parameters such as mobility,
lifetime, and generation rate that vary with altitude.
**** Thunderstorms and lightning[edit] ****
Main articles: Thunderstorms and lightning
The potential_difference between the ionosphere and the Earth is maintained by
thunderstorms, with lightning strikes delivering negative charges from the
atmosphere to the ground.
World map showing frequency of lightning strikes, in flashes per kmÂ² per year
(equal-area projection). Lightning strikes most frequently in the Democratic
Republic_of_the_Congo. Combined 1995â2003 data from the Optical Transient
Detector and 1998â2003 data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor.
Collisions between ice and soft hail (graupel) inside cumulonimbus_clouds
causes separation of positive and negative charges within the cloud, essential
for the generation of lightning. How lightning initially forms is still a
matter of debate: Scientists have studied root causes ranging from atmospheric
perturbations (wind, humidity, and atmospheric_pressure) to the impact of solar
wind and energetic particles.
An average bolt of lightning carries a negative electric current of 40
kiloamperes_(kA) (although some bolts can be up to 120 kA), and transfers a
charge of five coulombs and energy of 500 MJ, or enough energy to power a 100-
watt lightbulb for just under two months. The voltage depends on the length of
the bolt, with the dielectric_breakdown of air being three million volts per
meter, and lightning bolts often being several hundred meters long. However,
lightning leader development is not a simple matter of dielectric breakdown,
and the ambient electric fields required for lightning leader propagation can
be a few orders of magnitude less than dielectric breakdown strength. Further,
the potential gradient inside a well-developed return-stroke channel is on the
order of hundreds of volts per meter or less due to intense channel ionization,
resulting in a true power output on the order of megawatts per meter for a
vigorous return-stroke current of 100 kA .[10]
If the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated
from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be
calculated. In an average thunderstorm, the energy released amounts to about
10,000,000 kilowatt-hours (3.6Ã1013 joule), which is equivalent to a 20-
kiloton nuclear_warhead. A large, severe thunderstorm might be 10 to 100 times
more energetic.

**** Corona discharges[edit] ****
A depiction of atmospheric electricity in a Martian dust storm, which has been
suggested as a possible explanation for enigmatic chemistry results from Mars
(see also Viking_lander_biological_experiments)[17]
St._Elmo's_Fire is an electrical phenomenon in which luminous plasma is created
by a coronal_discharge originating from a grounded_object. Ball_lightning is
often erroneously identified as St. Elmo's Fire, whereas they are separate and
distinct phenomena.[18] Although referred to as "fire", St. Elmo's Fire is, in
fact, plasma, and is observed, usually during a thunderstorm, at the tops of
trees, spires or other tall objects, or on the heads of animals, as a brush or
star of light.
Corona is caused by the electric field around the object in question ionizing
the air molecules, producing a faint_glow easily visible in low-light
conditions. Approximately 1,000 â 30,000 volts per centimetre is required to
induce St. Elmo's Fire; however, this is dependent on the geometry of the
object in question. Sharp points tend to require lower voltage levels to
produce the same result because electric fields are more concentrated in areas
of high curvature, thus discharges are more intense at the end of pointed
objects. St. Elmo's Fire and normal sparks both can appear when high electrical
voltage affects a gas. St. Elmo's fire is seen during thunderstorms when the
ground below the storm is electrically charged, and there is high voltage in
the air between the cloud and the ground. The voltage tears apart the air
molecules and the gas begins to glow. The nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth's
atmosphere causes St. Elmo's Fire to fluoresce with blue or violet light; this
is similar to the mechanism that causes neon signs to glow.
**** Earth-Ionosphere cavity[edit] ****
Main article: Schumann_resonance
The Schumann_resonances are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low
frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth's electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann
resonance is due to the space between the surface of the Earth and the
conductive ionosphere acting as a waveguide. The limited dimensions of the
earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic
waves. The cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes.[19]
**** Electrical system grounding[edit] ****
Main article: Earthing_system
Atmospheric charges can cause undesirable, dangerous, and potentially lethal
charge potential buildup in suspended electric wire power distribution systems.
Bare wires suspended in the air spanning many kilometers and isolated from the
ground can collect very large stored charges at high voltage, even when there
is no thunderstorm or lightning occurring. This charge will seek to discharge
itself through the path of least insulation, which can occur when a person
reaches out to activate a power switch or to use an electric device.
To dissipate atmospheric charge buildup, one side of the electrical
distribution system is connected to the earth at many points throughout the
distribution system, as often as on every support pole. The one earth-connected
wire is commonly referred to as the "protective earth", and provides path for
the charge potential to dissipate without causing damage, and provides
redundancy in case any one of the ground paths is poor due to corrosion or poor
ground conductivity. The additional electric grounding wire that carries no
power serves a secondary role, providing a high-current short-circuit path to
rapidly blow fuses and render a damaged device safe, rather than have an
ungrounded device with damaged insulation become "electrically live" via the
grid power supply, and hazardous to touch.
Each transformer in an alternating current distribution grid segments the
grounding system into a new separate circuit loop. These separate grids must
also be grounded on one side to prevent charge buildup within them relative to
the rest of the system, and which could cause damage from charge potentials
discharging across the transformer coils to the other grounded side of the
distribution network.
