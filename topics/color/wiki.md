Colors can appear different depending on their surrounding colors and shapes.
The two small squares have exactly the same color, but the right one looks
slightly darker, the Chubb_illusion.
Color (American_English), or colour (Commonwealth_English), is the
characteristic of human visual_perception described through color categories,
with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple. This perception
of color derives from the stimulation of cone_cells in the human eye by
electromagnetic_radiation in the visible_spectrum. Color categories and
physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the
wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is
governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission
spectra, etc.
By defining a color_space, colors can be identified numerically by coordinates,
which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed
color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the International
Commission_on_Illumination. The RGB_color_space for instance is a color space
corresponding to human trichromacy and to the three cone cell types that
respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564Ã¢Â€Â“580 nm
(red); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534Ã¢Â€Â“545Â nm (green); and short-
wavelength light, near 420Ã¢Â€Â“440Â nm (blue).[1][2] There may also be more than
three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as in the CMYK_color_model,
wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's colorfulness).
The photo-receptivity of the "eyes" of other species also varies considerably
from that of humans and so results in correspondingly different_color
perceptions that cannot readily be compared to one another. Honeybees and
bumblebees for instance have trichromatic color vision sensitive to ultraviolet
but is insensitive to red. Papilio butterflies possess six types of
photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision.[3] The most complex color
vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the
mantis_shrimp) with up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to work as
multiple dichromatic units.[4]
The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply
color science. It includes the study of the perception of color by the human
eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color_theory in art, and the
physics of electromagnetic_radiation in the visible range (that is, what is
commonly referred to simply as light).

Electromagnetic_radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and
its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of
wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390Â nm to 700Â nm), it is
known as "visible light".
Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's
spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although
the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the
color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral
combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as
a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such
classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among
individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called
metamers of the color in question.
**** Spectral colors ****
The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrumÃ¢Â€Â”named using the Latin word
for appearance or apparition by Isaac_Newton in 1671Ã¢Â€Â”include all those colors
that can be produced by visible_light of a single wavelength only, the pure
spectral_or_monochromatic_colors. The table at right shows approximate
frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for various pure
spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or vacuum (see
refractive_index).
The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive listÃ¢Â€Â”the pure
spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct
colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency
(although people everywhere have been shown to perceive colors in the same way
[6]). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between
blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer
to what today is known as cyan, and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the
indigo_dye that was being imported at the time.[7]
The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is
viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity
orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive_green.
**** Color of objects ****
The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its
environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain.
Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their
surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination
and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the
angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but
also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contributes to the
color. A viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the
spectrum of the light leaving its surface, but also on a host of contextual
cues, so that color differences between objects can be discerned mostly
independent of the lighting spectrum, viewing angle, etc. This effect is known
as color_constancy.
The upper disk and the lower disk have exactly the same objective color, and
are in identical gray surroundings; based on context differences, humans
perceive the squares as having different reflectances, and may interpret the
colors as different color categories; see checker_shadow_illusion.
Some generalizations of the physics can be drawn, neglecting perceptual effects
for now:
    * Light arriving at an opaque surface is either reflected "specularly"
      (that is, in the manner of a mirror), scattered (that is, reflected with
      diffuse scattering), or absorbed Ã¢Â€Â“ or some combination of these.
    * Opaque objects that do not reflect specularly (which tend to have rough
      surfaces) have their color determined by which wavelengths of light they
      scatter strongly (with the light that is not scattered being absorbed).
      If objects scatter all wavelengths with roughly equal strength, they
      appear white. If they absorb all wavelengths, they appear black.[8]
    * Opaque objects that specularly reflect light of different wavelengths
      with different efficiencies look like mirrors tinted with colors
      determined by those differences. An object that reflects some fraction of
      impinging light and absorbs the rest may look black but also be faintly
      reflective; examples are black objects coated with layers of enamel or
      lacquer.
    * Objects that transmit_light are either translucent (scattering the
      transmitted light) or transparent (not scattering the transmitted light).
      If they also absorb (or reflect) light of various wavelengths
      differentially, they appear tinted with a color determined by the nature
      of that absorption (or that reflectance).
    * Objects may emit light that they generate from having excited electrons,
      rather than merely reflecting or transmitting light. The electrons may be
      excited due to elevated temperature (incandescence), as a result of
      chemical reactions (chemoluminescence), after absorbing light of other
      frequencies ("fluorescence" or "phosphorescence") or from electrical
      contacts as in light_emitting_diodes, or other light_sources.
To summarize, the color of an object is a complex result of its surface
properties, its transmission properties, and its emission properties, all of
which contribute to the mix of wavelengths in the light leaving the surface of
the object. The perceived color is then further conditioned by the nature of
the ambient illumination, and by the color properties of other objects nearby,
and via other characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain.
***** Perception *****
When viewed in full size, this image contains about 16 million pixels, each
corresponding to a different color on the full set of RGB colors. The human_eye
can distinguish about 10 million different colors.[9]
**** Development of theories of color vision ****
Main article: Color_theory
Although Aristotle and other ancient scientists had already written on the
nature of light and color_vision, it was not until Newton that light was
identified as the source of the color sensation. In 1810, Goethe published his
comprehensive Theory_of_Colors in which he ascribed physiological effects to
color that are now understood as psychological.
In 1801 Thomas_Young proposed his trichromatic_theory, based on the observation
that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory
was later refined by James_Clerk_Maxwell and Hermann_von_Helmholtz. As
Helmholtz puts it, "the principles of Newton's law of mixture were
experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color
sensations, like so much else that this marvelous investigator achieved in
advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to
it."[10]
At the same time as Helmholtz, Ewald_Hering developed the opponent_process
theory of color, noting that color_blindness and afterimages typically come in
opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-violet, and black-white).
Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson,
who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory,
while processing at the level of the lateral_geniculate_nucleus corresponds to
the opponent theory.[11]
In 1931, an international group of experts known as the Commission
internationale de l'ÃƒÂ©clairage (CIE) developed a mathematical color model,
which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three
numbers to each.
**** Color in the eye ****
Main article: Color_vision
Normalized typical human cone_cell responses (S, M, and L types) to
monochromatic spectral stimuli
The ability of the human_eye to distinguish colors is based upon the varying
sensitivity of different cells in the retina to light of different wavelengths.
Humans are trichromaticÃ¢Â€Â”the retina contains three types of color receptor
cells, or cones. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most
responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with wavelengths
around 450 nm; cones of this type are sometimes called short-wavelength cones,
S cones, or blue cones. The other two types are closely related genetically and
chemically: middle-wavelength cones, M cones, or green cones are most sensitive
to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 540Â nm, while the long-
wavelength cones, L cones, or red cones, are most sensitive to light is
perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570 Â nm.
Light, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to
three color components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the principle_of
univariance, which is that each cone's output is determined by the amount of
light that falls on it over all wavelengths. For each location in the visual
field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to
which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called
tristimulus values.
The response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone.
Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any
incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate only
the mid-wavelength (so-called "green") cones; the other cones will inevitably
be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible
tristimulus values determines the human color space. It has been estimated that
humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.[9]
The other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the rod, has a different
response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly
stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all.[12] On the
other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal
from the rods, resulting in a colorless response. (Furthermore, the rods are
barely sensitive to light in the "red" range.) In certain conditions of
intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can
together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses
alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the Kruithof_curve, that
describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as function
of temperature and intensity.
**** Color in the brain ****
Main article: Color_vision
The visual dorsal_stream (green) and ventral_stream (purple) are shown. The
ventral stream is responsible for color perception.
While the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-
described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is
organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color
information is transmitted out of the eye by three opponent_processes, or
opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a
redÃ¢Â€Â“green channel, a blueÃ¢Â€Â“yellow channel, and a blackÃ¢Â€Â“white "luminance"
channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the
structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why
humans cannot perceive a "reddish green" or "yellowish blue", and it predicts
the color_wheel: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the
two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.
The exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described,
and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as
a feature of our perception of the worldÃ¢Â€Â”a type of qualiaÃ¢Â€Â”is a matter of
complex and continuing philosophical dispute.
**** Nonstandard color perception ****
*** Color deficiency ***
Main article: Color_blindness
If one or more types of a person's color-sensing cones are missing or less
responsive than normal to incoming light, that person can distinguish fewer
colors and is said to be color deficient or color_blind (though this latter
term can be misleading; almost all color deficient individuals can distinguish
at least some colors). Some kinds of color deficiency are caused by anomalies
in the number or nature of cones in the retina. Others (like central or
cortical achromatopsia) are caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the
brain where visual processing takes place.
*** Tetrachromacy ***
Main article: Tetrachromacy
While most humans are trichromatic (having three types of color receptors),
many animals, known as tetrachromats, have four types. These include some
species of spiders, most marsupials, birds, reptiles, and many species of fish.
Other species are sensitive to only two axes of color or do not perceive color
at all; these are called dichromats and monochromats respectively. A
distinction is made between retinal tetrachromacy (having four pigments in cone
cells in the retina, compared to three in trichromats) and functional
tetrachromacy (having the ability to make enhanced color discriminations based
on that retinal difference). As many as half of all women are retinal
tetrachromats.[13]:p.256 The phenomenon arises when an individual receives two
slightly different copies of the gene for either the medium- or long-wavelength
cones, which are carried on the XÂ chromosome. To have two different genes, a
person must have two XÂ chromosomes, which is why the phenomenon only occurs in
women.[13] There is one scholarly report that confirms the existence of a
functional tetrachromat.[14]
*** Synesthesia ***
In certain forms of synesthesia/ideasthesia, perceiving letters and numbers
(graphemeÃ¢Â€Â“color_synesthesia) or hearing musical sounds (musicÃ¢Â€Â“color
synesthesia) will lead to the unusual additional experiences of seeing colors.
Behavioral and functional_neuroimaging experiments have demonstrated that these
color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased
activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating
their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a
non-standard route.
**** Afterimages ****
After exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, photoreceptors of a
given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they
will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors
observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by
the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon
of afterimages, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after
looking away from it, but in a complementary_color.
Afterimage effects have also been utilized by artists, including Vincent_van
Gogh.
**** Color constancy ****
Main article: Color_constancy
When an artist uses a limited color_palette, the eye tends to compensate by
seeing any gray or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color
wheel. For example, in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black, and
white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a
mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure gray will
appear bluish.[15]
The trichromatic theory is strictly true when the visual system is in a fixed
state of adaptation. In reality, the visual system is constantly adapting to
changes in the environment and compares the various colors in a scene to reduce
the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and
then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays
within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear relatively constant
to us. This was studied by Edwin_Land in the 1970s and led to his retinex
theory of color_constancy.
Both phenomena are readily explained and mathematically modeled with modern
theories of chromatic adaptation and color appearance (e.g. CIECAM02, iCAM).
[16] There is no need to dismiss the trichromatic theory of vision, but rather
it can be enhanced with an understanding of how the visual system adapts to
changes in the viewing environment.
**** Color naming ****
Main article: Color_term
See also: Lists_of_colors and Web_colors
This picture contains one million pixels, each one a different color
Colors vary in several different ways, including hue (shades of red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, and violet), saturation, brightness, and gloss. Some color
words are derived from the name of an object of that color, such as "orange" or
"salmon", while others are abstract, like "red".
In the 1969 study Basic_Color_Terms:_Their_Universality_and_Evolution, Brent
Berlin and Paul_Kay describe a pattern in naming "basic" colors (like "red" but
not "red-orange" or "dark red" or "blood red", which are "shades" of red). All
languages that have two "basic" color names distinguish dark/cool colors from
bright/warm colors. The next colors to be distinguished are usually red and
then yellow or green. All languages with six "basic" colors include black,
white, red, green, blue, and yellow. The pattern holds up to a set of twelve:
black, gray, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and
azure (distinct from blue in Russian and Italian, but not English).
**** Associations ****
Individual colors have a variety of cultural associations such as national
colors (in general described in individual color articles and color_symbolism).
The field of color_psychology attempts to identify the effects of color on
human emotion and activity. Chromotherapy is a form of alternative_medicine
attributed to various Eastern traditions. Colors have different associations in
different countries and cultures.[17]
Different colors have been demonstrated to have effects on cognition. For
example, researchers at the University of Linz in Austria demonstrated that the
color red significantly decreases cognitive functioning in men.[18]
***** Spectral colors and color reproduction *****
The CIE_1931_color_space chromaticity_diagram. The outer curved boundary is the
spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. The
colors depicted depend on the color_space of the device on which you are
viewing the image, and therefore may not be a strictly accurate representation
of the color at a particular position, and especially not for monochromatic
colors.
Most light sources are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. Many such
sources can still effectively produce a spectral color, as the eye cannot
distinguish them from single-wavelength sources. For example, most computer
displays reproduce the spectral color orange as a combination of red and green
light; it appears orange because the red and green are mixed in the right
proportions to allow the eye's cones to respond the way they do to the spectral
color orange.
A useful concept in understanding the perceived color of a non-monochromatic
light source is the dominant_wavelength, which identifies the single wavelength
of light that produces a sensation most similar to the light source. Dominant
wavelength is roughly akin to hue.
There are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral
colors due to desaturation or because they are purples (mixtures of red and
violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily
non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and
colors such as pink, tan, and magenta.
Two different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color
receptors in the human_eye will be perceived as the same color. They are
metamers of that color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by
fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while
daylight has a continuous spectrum. The human eye cannot tell the difference
between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although
reflected colors from objects can look different. (This is often exploited; for
example, to make fruit or tomatoes look more intensely red.)
Similarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three
colors called primaries. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography,
printing, television, and other media. There are a number of methods or color
spaces for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each
method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular
application.
No mixture of colors, however, can produce a response truly identical to that
of a spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer
wavelengths, where the CIE_1931_color_space chromaticity diagram has a nearly
straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530Â nm) and blue light (460Â nm)
produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red
color receptor would be greater to the green and blue light in the mixture than
it would be to a pure cyan light at 485Â nm that has the same intensity as the
mixture of blue and green.
Because of this, and because the primaries in color_printing systems generally
are not pure themselves, the colors reproduced are never perfectly saturated
spectral colors, and so spectral colors cannot be matched exactly. However,
natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors, thus such scenes can
usually be approximated well by these systems. The range of colors that can be
reproduced with a given color reproduction system is called the gamut. The CIE
chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut.
Another problem with color reproduction systems is connected with the
acquisition devices, like cameras or scanners. The characteristics of the color
sensors in the devices are often very far from the characteristics of the
receptors in the human eye. In effect, acquisition of colors can be relatively
poor if they have special, often very "jagged", spectra caused for example by
unusual lighting of the photographed scene. A color reproduction system "tuned"
to a human with normal color vision may give very inaccurate results for other
observers.
The different color response of different devices can be problematic if not
properly managed. For color information stored and transferred in digital form,
color_management techniques, such as those based on ICC_profiles, can help to
avoid distortions of the reproduced colors. Color management does not
circumvent the gamut limitations of particular output devices, but can assist
in finding good mapping of input colors into the gamut that can be reproduced.
**** Additive coloring ****
Additive color mixing: combining red and green yields yellow; combining all
three primary colors together yields white.
Additive_color is light created by mixing together light of two or more
different colors. Red, green, and blue are the additive primary_colors normally
used in additive color systems such as projectors and computer terminals.
**** Subtractive coloring ****
Subtractive color mixing: combining yellow and magenta yields red; combining
all three primary colors together yields black
Subtractive_coloring uses dyes, inks, pigments, or filters to absorb some
wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays comes
from the parts of the visible spectrum that are not absorbed and therefore
remain visible. Without pigments or dye, fabric fibers, paint base and paper
are usually made of particles that scatter white light (all colors) well in all
directions. When a pigment or ink is added, wavelengths are absorbed or
"subtracted" from white light, so light of another color reaches the eye.
If the light is not a pure white source (the case of nearly all forms of
artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different
color. Red paint, viewed under blue light, may appear black. Red paint is red
because it scatters only the red components of the spectrum. If red paint is
illuminated by blue light, it will be absorbed by the red paint, creating the
appearance of a black object.
**** Structural color ****
Further information: Structural_coloration and Animal_coloration
Structural colors are colors caused by interference effects rather than by
pigments. Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine
parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise
composed of microstructures on the scale of the color's wavelength. If the
microstructures are spaced randomly, light of shorter wavelengths will be
scattered preferentially to produce Tyndall_effect colors: the blue of the sky
(Rayleigh scattering, caused by structures much smaller than the wavelength of
light, in this case air molecules), the luster of opals, and the blue of human
irises. If the microstructures are aligned in arrays, for example the array of
pits in a CD, they behave as a diffraction_grating: the grating reflects
different wavelengths in different directions due to interference phenomena,
separating mixed "white" light into light of different wavelengths. If the
structure is one or more thin layers then it will reflect some wavelengths and
transmit others, depending on the layers' thickness.
Structural color is studied in the field of thin-film_optics. The most ordered
or the most changeable structural colors are iridescent. Structural color is
responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue
jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells.
Variations in the pattern's spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as
seen in peacock feathers, soap_bubbles, films of oil, and mother_of_pearl,
because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists
have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac
Newton and Robert Hooke. Since 1942, electron_micrography has been used,
advancing the development of products that exploit structural color, such as
"photonic" cosmetics.[19]
***** Additional terms *****
    * Color_wheel: an illustrative organization of color hues in a circle that
      shows relationships.
    * Colorfulness, chroma, purity, or saturation: how "intense" or
      "concentrated" a color is. Technical definitions distinguish between
      colorfulness, chroma, and saturation as distinct perceptual attributes
      and include purity as a physical quantity. These terms, and others
      related to light and color are internationally agreed upon and published
      in the CIE Lighting Vocabulary.[20] More readily available texts on
      colorimetry also define and explain these terms.[16][21]
    * Dichromatism: a phenomenon where the hue is dependent on concentration
      and thickness of the absorbing substance.
    * Hue: the color's direction from white, for example in a color_wheel or
      chromaticity_diagram.
    * Shade: a color made darker by adding black.
    * Tint: a color made lighter by adding white.
    * Value, brightness, lightness, or luminosity: how light or dark a color
      is.
