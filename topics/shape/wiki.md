This article is about describing the shape of an object e.g. shapes like a
triangle. For common shapes, see List_of_geometric_shapes. For other uses, see
Shape_(disambiguation).
An example of the different definitions of shape. The two triangles on the left
are congruent, while the third is similar to them. The last triangle is neither
similar nor congruent to any of the others, but it is homeomorphic.
A shape is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external
surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture or material
type.

***** Classification of simple shapes[edit] *****
Main article: Lists_of_shapes
A variety of polygonal shapes.
Some simple shapes can be put into broad categories. For instance, polygons are
classified according to their number of edges as triangles, quadrilaterals,
pentagons, etc. Each of these is divided into smaller categories; triangles can
be equilateral, isosceles, obtuse, acute, scalene, etc. while quadrilaterals
can be rectangles, rhombi, trapezoids, squares, etc.
Other common shapes are points, lines, planes, and conic_sections such as
ellipses, circles, and parabolas.
Among the most common 3-dimensional shapes are polyhedra, which are shapes with
flat faces; ellipsoids, which are egg-shaped or sphere-shaped objects;
cylinders; and cones.
If an object falls into one of these categories exactly or even approximately,
we can use it to describe the shape of the object. Thus, we say that the shape
of a manhole_cover is a disk, because it is approximately the same geometric
object as an actual geometric disk.
***** Shape in geometry[edit] *****
There are several ways to compare the shapes of two objects:
    * Congruence: Two objects are congruent if one can be transformed into the
      other by a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.
    * Similarity: Two objects are similar if one can be transformed into the
      other by a uniform scaling, together with a sequence of rotations,
      translations, and/or reflections.
    * Isotopy: Two objects are isotopic if one can be transformed into the
      other by a sequence of deformations that do not tear the object or put
      holes in it.
Sometimes, two similar or congruent objects may be regarded as having a
different shape if a reflection is required to transform one into the other.
For instance, the letters "b" and "d" are a reflection of each other, and hence
they are congruent and similar, but in some contexts they are not regarded as
having the same shape. Sometimes, only the outline or external boundary of the
object is considered to determine its shape. For instance, a hollow sphere may
be considered to have the same shape as a solid sphere. Procrustes_analysis is
used in many sciences to determine whether or not two objects have the same
shape, or to measure the difference between two shapes. In advanced
mathematics, quasi-isometry can be used as a criterion to state that two shapes
are approximately the same.
Simple shapes can often be classified into basic geometric objects such as a
point, a line, a curve, a plane, a plane_figure (e.g. square or circle), or a
solid figure (e.g. cube or sphere). However, most shapes occurring in the
physical world are complex. Some, such as plant structures and coastlines, may
be so complicated as to defy traditional mathematical description â in which
case they may be analyzed by differential_geometry, or as fractals.
**** Equivalence of shapes[edit] ****
In geometry, two subsets of a Euclidean_space have the same shape if one can be
transformed to the other by a combination of translations, rotations (together
also called rigid_transformations), and uniform_scalings. In other words, the
shape of a set of points is all the geometrical information that is invariant
to translations, rotations, and size changes. Having the same shape is an
equivalence_relation, and accordingly a precise mathematical definition of the
notion of shape can be given as being an equivalence_class of subsets of a
Euclidean space having the same shape.
Mathematician and statistician David_George_Kendall writes:[1]
     In this paper âshapeâ is used in the vulgar sense, and means what
     one would normally expect it to mean. [...] We here define
     âshapeâ informally as âall the geometrical information that
     remains when location, scale[2] and rotational effects are filtered
     out from an object.â
Shapes of physical objects are equal if the subsets of space these objects
occupy satisfy the definition above. In particular, the shape does not depend
on the size and placement in space of the object. For instance, a "d" and a "p"
have the same shape, as they can be perfectly superimposed if the "d" is
translated to the right by a given distance, rotated upside down and magnified
by a given factor (see Procrustes_superimposition for details). However, a
mirror_image could be called a different shape. For instance, a "b" and a "p"
have a different shape, at least when they are constrained to move within a
two-dimensional space like the page on which they are written. Even though they
have the same size, there's no way to perfectly superimpose them by translating
and rotating them along the page. Similarly, within a three-dimensional space,
a right hand and a left hand have a different shape, even if they are the
mirror images of each other. Shapes may change if the object is scaled non-
uniformly. For example, a sphere becomes an ellipsoid when scaled differently
in the vertical and horizontal directions. In other words, preserving axes of
symmetry (if they exist) is important for preserving shapes. Also, shape is
determined by only the outer boundary of an object.
**** Congruence and similarity[edit] ****
Main articles: Congruence_(geometry) and Similarity_(geometry)
Objects that can be transformed into each other by rigid transformations and
mirroring (but not scaling) are congruent. An object is therefore congruent to
its mirror_image (even if it is not symmetric), but not to a scaled version.
Two congruent objects always have either the same shape or mirror image shapes,
and have the same size.
Objects that have the same shape or mirror image shapes are called
geometrically_similar, whether or not they have the same size. Thus, objects
that can be transformed into each other by rigid transformations, mirroring,
and uniform scaling are similar. Similarity is preserved when one of the
objects is uniformly scaled, while congruence is not. Thus, congruent objects
are always geometrically similar, but similar objects may not be congruent, as
they may have different size.
**** Homeomorphism[edit] ****
Main article: Homeomorphism
A more flexible definition of shape takes into consideration the fact that
realistic shapes are often deformable, e.g. a person in different postures, a
tree bending in the wind or a hand with different finger positions.
One way of modeling non-rigid movements is by homeomorphisms. Roughly speaking,
a homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending of an object into a new
shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere
and a donut are not. An often-repeated mathematical_joke is that topologists
cannot tell their coffee cup from their donut,[3] since a sufficiently pliable
donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and
progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cup's handle.
***** Shape analysis[edit] *****
Main article: Statistical_shape_analysis
The above-mentioned mathematical definitions of rigid and non-rigid shape have
arisen in the field of statistical_shape_analysis. In particular, Procrustes
analysis is a technique used for comparing shapes of similar objects (e.g.
bones of different animals), or measuring the deformation of a deformable
object. Other methods are designed to work with non-rigid (bendable) objects,
e.g. for posture independent shape retrieval (see for example Spectral_shape
analysis).
***** Similarity classes[edit] *****
All similar_triangles have the same shape. These shapes can be classified using
complex_numbers u, v, w for the vertices, in a method advanced by J.A. Lester
[4] and Rafael_Artzy. For example, an equilateral_triangle can be expressed by
the complex numbers 0, 1, (1 + i â3)/2 representing its vertices. Lester and
Artzy call the ratio
         S ( u , v , w ) =    u &#x2212; w   u &#x2212; v      {\displaystyle S
      (u,v,w)={\frac {u-w}{u-v}}}  [S(u,v,w)={\frac  {u-w}{u-v}}]
the shape of triangle (u, v, w). Then the shape of the equilateral triangle is
      (0â(1+ â3)/2)/(0â1) = ( 1 + i â3)/2 = cos(60Â°) + i sin(60Â°) =
      exp( i Ï/3).
For any affine_transformation of the complex_plane,     z &#x21A6; a z + b ,  a
&#x2260; 0 ,   {\displaystyle z\mapsto az+b,\quad a\neq 0,}  [z\mapsto
az+b,\quad a\neq 0,]   a triangle is transformed but does not change its shape.
Hence shape is an invariant of affine_geometry. The shape p = S(u,v,w) depends
on the order of the arguments of function S, but permutations lead to related
values. For instance,
         1 &#x2212; p = 1 &#x2212; ( u &#x2212; w )  /  ( u &#x2212; v ) = ( w
      &#x2212; v )  /  ( u &#x2212; v ) = ( v &#x2212; w )  /  ( v &#x2212; u )
      = S ( v , u , w ) .   {\displaystyle 1-p=1-(u-w)/(u-v)=(w-v)/(u-v)=(v-w)/
      (v-u)=S(v,u,w).}  [1-p=1-(u-w)/(u-v)=(w-v)/(u-v)=(v-w)/(v-u)=S(v,u,w).]
      Also      p  &#x2212; 1   = S ( u , w , v ) .   {\displaystyle p^{-1}=S
      (u,w,v).}  [p^{{-1}}=S(u,w,v).]
Combining these permutations gives     S ( v , w , u ) = ( 1 &#x2212; p  )
&#x2212; 1   .   {\displaystyle S(v,w,u)=(1-p)^{-1}.}  [S(v,w,u)=(1-p)^{{-1}}.]
Furthermore,
         p ( 1 &#x2212; p  )  &#x2212; 1   = S ( u , v , w ) S ( v , w , u ) =
      ( u &#x2212; w )  /  ( v &#x2212; w ) = S ( w , v , u ) .
      {\displaystyle p(1-p)^{-1}=S(u,v,w)S(v,w,u)=(u-w)/(v-w)=S(w,v,u).}  [p(1-
      p)^{{-1}}=S(u,v,w)S(v,w,u)=(u-w)/(v-w)=S(w,v,u).] These relations are
      "conversion rules" for shape of a triangle.
The shape of a quadrilateral is associated with two complex numbers p,q. If the
quadrilateral has vertices u,v,w,x, then p = S(u,v,w) and q = S(v,w,x). Artzy
proves these propositions about quadrilateral shapes:
   1. If     p = ( 1 &#x2212; q  )  &#x2212; 1   ,   {\displaystyle p=(1-q)^{-
      1},}  [p=(1-q)^{{-1}},] then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
   2. If a parallelogram has | arg p | = | arg q |, then it is a rhombus.
   3. When p = 1 + i and q = (1 + i)/2, then the quadrilateral is square.
   4. If     p = r ( 1 &#x2212;  q  &#x2212; 1   )   {\displaystyle p=r(1-q^{-
      1})}  [p=r(1-q^{{-1}})] and sgn r = sgn(Im p), then the quadrilateral is
      a trapezoid.
A polygon     (  z  1   ,  z  2   , . . .  z  n   )   {\displaystyle (z_{1},z_
{2},...z_{n})}  [(z_{1},z_{2},...z_{n})] has a shape defined by n â 2 complex
numbers     S (  z  j   ,  z  j + 1   ,  z  j + 2   ) , &#xA0; j = 1 , . . . ,
n &#x2212; 2.   {\displaystyle S(z_{j},z_{j+1},z_{j+2}),\ j=1,...,n-2.}  [
{\displaystyle S(z_{j},z_{j+1},z_{j+2}),\ j=1,...,n-2.}] The polygon bounds a
convex_set when all these shape components have imaginary components of the
same sign.[5]
***** Human perception of shapes[edit] *****
Psychologists have theorized that humans mentally break down images into simple
geometric shapes called geons.[6] Examples of geons include cones and spheres.
A wide range of other shape representations have also been investigated.[7]
There also seems to be something about shape that can guide human attention.[8]
