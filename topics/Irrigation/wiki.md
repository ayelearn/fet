The hub of a center-pivot irrigation system
Irrigation is the application of controlled amounts of water to plants at
needed intervals. Irrigation helps to grow agricultural_crops, maintain
landscapes, and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of
less than average rainfall. Irrigation also has other uses in crop production,
including frost protection,[1] suppressing weed growth in grain fields[2] and
preventing soil_consolidation.[3] In contrast, agriculture that relies only on
direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry_land_farming.
Irrigation systems are also used for cooling livestock, dust_suppression,
disposal of sewage, and in mining. Irrigation is often studied together with
drainage, which is the removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given
area.

Irrigation has been a central feature of agriculture for over 5,000 years and
is the product of many cultures. Historically, it was the basis for economies
and societies across the globe, from Asia to the Southwestern_United_States.

***** History[edit] *****
Animal-powered irrigation, Upper Egypt, ca. 1846
Archaeological investigation has found evidence of irrigation in areas lacking
sufficient natural rainfall to support crops for rainfed_agriculture. The
earliest known use of the technology dates to the 6th millennium BCE in
Khuzistan in the south-west of present-day Iran.[4][5]
Irrigation was used as a means of manipulation of water in the alluvial plains
of the Indus_valley_civilization, the application of it is estimated to have
begun around 4500 BC and drastically increased the size and prosperity of their
agricultural settlements.[6] The Indus Valley Civilization developed
sophisticated irrigation and water-storage systems, including artificial
reservoirs at Girnar dated to 3000 BCE, and an early canal irrigation system
from c. 2600 BCE. Large-scale agriculture was practiced, with an extensive
network of canals used for the purpose of irrigation.[6][7]
Farmers in the Mesopotamian plain used irrigation from at least the third
millennium BCE.[8] They developed perennial irrigation, regularly watering
crops throughout the growing_season by coaxing water through a matrix of small
channels formed in the field.[9] Ancient_Egyptians practiced basin irrigation
using the flooding_of_the_Nile to inundate land plots which had been surrounded
by dykes. The flood water remained until the fertile sediment had settled
before the engineers returned the surplus to the watercourse.[10] There is
evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet_III in the twelfth_dynasty
(about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Faiyum_Oasis as a reservoir to
store surpluses of water for use during dry seasons. The lake swelled annually
from the flooding of the Nile.[11]
Young engineers restoring and developing the old Mughal irrigation system in
1847 during the reign of the Mughal_Emperor Bahadur_Shah_II
The Ancient_Nubians developed a form of irrigation by using a waterwheel-like
device called a sakia. Irrigation began in Nubia some time between the third
and second millennia BCE.[12] It largely depended upon the flood waters that
would flow through the Nile_River and other rivers in what is now the Sudan.
[13]
Irrigation in Tamil_Nadu,_India
In sub-Saharan_Africa irrigation reached the Niger_River region cultures and
civilizations by the first or second millennium BCE and was based on wet-season
flooding and water harvesting.[14][15]
Evidence of terrace irrigation occurs in pre-Columbian America, early Syria,
India, and China.[10] In the Zana Valley of the Andes_Mountains in Peru,
archaeologists have found remains of three irrigation canals radiocarbon-dated
from the 4th_millennium_BCE, the 3rd millennium BCE and the 9th century CE.
These canals provide the earliest record of irrigation in the New_World. Traces
of a canal possibly dating from the 5th_millennium_BCE were found under the
4th-millennium canal.[16]
Ancient_Persia (modern day Iran) used irrigation as far back as the 6th
millennium_BCE to grow barley in areas with insufficient natural rainfall.[17]
[need_quotation_to_verify] The Qanats, developed in ancient Persia about 800
BCE, are among the oldest known irrigation methods still in use today. They are
now found in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. The system comprises a
network of vertical wells and gently sloping tunnels driven into the sides of
cliffs and of steep hills to tap groundwater.[18] The noria, a water wheel with
clay pots around the rim powered by the flow of the stream (or by animals where
the water source was still), first came into use at about this time among Roman
settlers in North Africa. By 150 BCE the pots were fitted with valves to allow
smoother filling as they were forced into the water.[19]
The irrigation works of ancient Sri_Lanka, the earliest dating from about 300
BCE in the reign of King Pandukabhaya, and under continuous development for the
next thousand years, were one of the most complex irrigation systems of the
ancient world. In addition to underground canals, the Sinhalese were the first
to build completely artificial reservoirs to store water.[citation_needed]
These reservoirs and canal systems were used primarily to irrigate paddy
fields, which require a lot of water to cultivate. Most of these irrigation
systems still exist undamaged up to now, in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa,
because of the advanced and precise engineering. The system was extensively
restored and further extended[by_whom?] during the reign of King Parakrama_Bahu
(1153â1186 CE).[20]
**** China[edit] ****
Inside a karez tunnel at Turpan, Xinjiang, China
The oldest known hydraulic engineers of China were Sunshu_Ao (6th century BCE)
of the Spring_and_Autumn_period and Ximen_Bao (5th century BCE) of the Warring
States period, both of whom worked on large irrigation projects. In the Sichuan
region belonging to the state_of_Qin of ancient China, the Dujiangyan
Irrigation_System devised by the Qin Chinese hydrologist and irrigation
engineer Li_Bing was built in 256 BCE to irrigate a vast area of farmland that
today still supplies water.[21] By the 2nd century AD, during the Han_Dynasty,
the Chinese also used chain_pumps which lifted water from a lower elevation to
a higher one.[22] These were powered by manual foot-pedal, hydraulic
waterwheels, or rotating mechanical wheels pulled by oxen.[23] The water was
used for public_works, providing water for urban residential quarters and
palace gardens, but mostly for irrigation of farmland canals and channels in
the fields.[24]
**** Korea[edit] ****
Korea, Jang_Yeong-sil, a Korean engineer of the Joseon_Dynasty, under the
active direction of the king, Sejong_the_Great, invented the world's first
rain-gauge, uryanggye (Korean:ì°ëê³) in 1441. It was installed in
irrigation tanks[by_whom?] as part of a nationwide system to measure and
collect rainfall for agricultural applications. With this instrument, planners
and farmers could make better use of the information gathered in the[which?]
survey.[25]
**** North America[edit] ****
Irrigation ditch in Montour County, Pennsylvania
Main article: Hohokam
The earliest agricultural irrigation canal system known in the area of the
present-day United_States dates to between 1200 B.C. and 800 B.C. and was
discovered[by_whom?] in Marana, Arizona (adjacent to Tucson) in 2009.[26] The
irrigation-canal system predates the Hohokam culture by two thousand years and
belongs to an unidentified culture. In North America, the Hohokam were the only
culture known to rely on irrigation canals to water their crops, and their
irrigation systems supported the largest population in the Southwest by AD
1300. The Hohokam constructed an assortment of simple canals combined with
weirs in their various agricultural pursuits. Between the 7th and 14th
centuries they built and maintained extensive irrigation networks along the
lower Salt and middle Gila_Rivers that rivaled the complexity of those used in
the ancient Near East, Egypt, and China. These were constructed using
relatively simple excavation tools, without the benefit of advanced engineering
technologies, and achieved drops of a few feet per mile, balancing erosion and
siltation. The Hohokam cultivated varieties of cotton, tobacco, maize, beans
and squash, as well as harvesting an assortment of wild plants. Late in the
Hohokam Chronological Sequence, they also used extensive dry-farming systems,
primarily to grow agave for food and fiber. Their reliance on agricultural
strategies based on canal irrigation, vital in their less-than-hospitable
desert environment and arid climate, provided the basis for the aggregation of
rural populations into stable urban centers.[27][need_quotation_to_verify]
***** Present extent[edit] *****
Irrigation of land in Punjab,_India
In year 2000, the total fertile land was 2,788,000 kmÂ² (689 million acres) and
it was equipped with irrigation infrastructure worldwide. About 68% of this
area is in Asia, 17% in the Americas, 9% in Europe, 5% in Africa and 1% in
Oceania. The largest contiguous areas of high irrigation density are found:
          * In Northern India and Pakistan along the Ganges and Indus rivers
          * In the Hai He, Huang He and Yangtze basins in China
          * Along the Nile river in Egypt and Sudan
          * In the Mississippi-Missouri river basin, the Southern Great Plains,
            and in parts of California
Smaller irrigation areas are spread across almost all populated parts of the
world.[28]
By 2012, the area of irrigated land had increased to an estimated total of
3,242,917 kmÂ² (801 million acres), which is nearly the size of India.[29]
***** Advantages of irrigation[edit] *****
    * Increase in food production: Increase in crop yield leads to an increase
      in food production, thus developing people as well as society
    * Protection against drought: The provision of adequate watering facilities
      in any region ensures protection against failure of crops from famines
      and droughts.
    * Revenue generation: When the regular supply of water is assured, the
      farmers can grow certain superior or high priced crops in place of
      inferior or low priced crops. As a result, revenue is generated.
    * Mixed Cropping: Means growing two or more crops together in the same
      field. This practice is followed so that if weather conditions are not
      favourable for one crop, it may be suitable for other crops. But if
      enough water facilities are made available, the need for mixed cropping
      is eliminated.[30]
***** Types of irrigation[edit] *****
There are several methods of irrigation. They vary in how the water is supplied
to the plants. The goal is to apply the water to the plants as uniformly as
possible, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much
nor too little.
**** Surface irrigation[edit] ****
Main article: Surface_irrigation
Basin flood irrigation of wheat
Surface irrigation is the oldest form of irrigation and has been in use for
thousands of years. In surface ( flood, or level basin) irrigation systems,
water moves across the surface of an agricultural lands, in order to wet it and
infiltrate into the soil. Surface irrigation can be subdivided into
furrow,border strip or basin irrigation. It is often called flood irrigation
when the irrigation results in flooding or near flooding of the cultivated
land. Historically, this has been the most common method of irrigating
agricultural land and is still used in most parts of the world.
Where water levels from the irrigation source permit, the levels are controlled
by dikes, usually plugged by soil. This is often seen in terraced rice fields
(rice paddies), where the method is used to flood or control the level of water
in each distinct field. In some cases, the water is pumped, or lifted by human
or animal power to the level of the land. The water application efficiency of
surface irrigation is typically lower than other forms of irrigation.
Residential flood irrigation in Phoenix, Arizona
Surface irrigation is even used to water landscapes in certain areas, for
example, in and around Phoenix,_Arizona. The irrigated area is surrounded by a
berm and the water is delivered according to a schedule set by a local
irrigation_district.[31]
**** Micro-irrigation[edit] ****
Main article: Micro-irrigation
Drip irrigation â a dripper in action
Micro-irrigation, sometimes called localized irrigation, low volume irrigation,
or trickle irrigation is a system where water is distributed under low pressure
through a piped network, in a pre-determined pattern, and applied as a small
discharge to each plant or adjacent to it. Traditional drip irrigation using
individual emitters, subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), micro-spray or micro-
sprinkler irrigation, and mini-bubbler irrigation all belong to this category
of irrigation methods.[32]
*** Drip irrigation[edit] ***
Drip irrigation layout and its parts
Main article: Drip_irrigation
Micro-sprinkler
Drip (or micro) irrigation, also known as trickle irrigation, functions as its
name suggests. In this system water falls drop by drop just at the position of
roots. Water is delivered at or near the root zone of plants, drop by drop.
This method can be the most water-efficient method of irrigation,[33] if
managed properly, evaporation and runoff are minimized. The field water
efficiency of drip irrigation is typically in the range of 80 to 90 percent
when managed correctly.
In modern agriculture, drip irrigation is often combined with plastic_mulch,
further reducing evaporation, and is also the means of delivery of fertilizer.
The process is known as fertigation.
Deep percolation, where water moves below the root zone, can occur if a drip
system is operated for too long or if the delivery rate is too high. Drip
irrigation methods range from very high-tech and computerized to low-tech and
labor-intensive. Lower water pressures are usually needed than for most other
types of systems, with the exception of low energy center pivot systems and
surface irrigation systems, and the system can be designed for uniformity
throughout a field or for precise water delivery to individual plants in a
landscape containing a mix of plant species. Although it is difficult to
regulate pressure on steep slopes, pressure compensating emitters are
available, so the field does not have to be level. High-tech solutions involve
precisely calibrated emitters located along lines of tubing that extend from a
computerized set of valves.
**** Sprinkler irrigation[edit] ****

Further information: Irrigation_sprinkler
In sprinkler or overhead irrigation, water is piped to one or more central
locations within the field and distributed by overhead high-pressure sprinklers
or guns. A system using sprinklers, sprays, or guns mounted overhead on
permanently installed risers is often referred to as a solid-set irrigation
system. Higher pressure sprinklers that rotate are called rotors and are driven
by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism. Rotors can be designed to
rotate in a full or partial circle. Guns are similar to rotors, except that
they generally operate at very high pressures of 275 to 900 kPa (40 to 130 psi)
and flows of 3 to 76 L/s (50 to 1200 US gal/min), usually with nozzle diameters
in the range of 10 to 50 mm (0.5 to 1.9 in). Guns are used not only for
irrigation, but also for industrial applications such as dust suppression and
logging.
Sprinklers can also be mounted on moving platforms connected to the water
source by a hose. Automatically moving wheeled systems known as traveling
sprinklers may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks,
pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these use a length of polyethylene
tubing wound on a steel drum. As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the
irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the
field. When the sprinkler arrives back at the reel the system shuts off. This
type of system is known to most people as a "waterreel" traveling irrigation
sprinkler and they are used extensively for dust suppression, irrigation, and
land application of waste water.
Other travelers use a flat rubber hose that is dragged along behind while the
sprinkler platform is pulled by a cable.
*** Center pivot[edit] ***

Main article: Center_pivot_irrigation
[Center_pivot_irrigation]
Center_pivot_irrigation
Center pivot irrigation is a form of sprinkler irrigation utilising several
segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminium) joined together and
supported by trusses, mounted on wheeled towers with sprinklers positioned
along its length.[34] The system moves in a circular pattern and is fed with
water from the pivot point at the center of the arc. These systems are found
and used in all parts of the world and allow irrigation of all types of
terrain. Newer systems have drop sprinkler heads as shown in the image that
follows.
As of 2017[update] most center pivot systems have drops hanging from a U-shaped
pipe attached at the top of the pipe with sprinkler heads that are positioned a
few feet (at most) above the crop, thus limiting evaporative losses. Drops can
also be used with drag hoses or bubblers that deposit the water directly on the
ground between crops. Crops are often planted in a circle to conform to the
center pivot. This type of system is known as LEPA (Low_Energy_Precision
Application). Originally, most center pivots were water-powered. These were
replaced by hydraulic systems (T-L_Irrigation) and electric-motor-driven
systems (Reinke, Valley, Zimmatic). Many modern pivots feature GPS devices.[35]
*** Irrigation by lateral move (side roll, wheel line, wheelmove)[36][37][edit]
***
A series of pipes, each with a wheel of about 1.5 m diameter permanently
affixed to its midpoint, and sprinklers along its length, are coupled together.
Water is supplied at one end using a large hose. After sufficient irrigation
has been applied to one strip of the field, the hose is removed, the water
drained from the system, and the assembly rolled either by hand or with a
purpose-built mechanism, so that the sprinklers are moved to a different
position across the field. The hose is reconnected. The process is repeated in
a pattern until the whole field has been irrigated.
This system is less expensive to install than a center pivot, but much more
labor-intensive to operate â it does not travel automatically across the
field: it applies water in a stationary strip, must be drained, and then rolled
to a new strip. Most systems use 100 or 130 mm (4 or 5 inch) diameter aluminum
pipe. The pipe doubles both as water transport and as an axle for rotating all
the wheels. A drive system (often found near the centre of the wheel line)
rotates the clamped-together pipe sections as a single axle, rolling the whole
wheel line. Manual adjustment of individual wheel positions may be necessary if
the system becomes misaligned.
Wheel line systems are limited in the amount of water they can carry, and
limited in the height of crops that can be irrigated. One useful feature of a
lateral move system is that it consists of sections that can be easily
disconnected, adapting to field shape as the line is moved. They are most often
used for small, rectilinear, or oddly-shaped fields, hilly or mountainous
regions, or in regions where labor is inexpensive.
*** Lawn sprinkler systems[edit] ***
A lawn sprinkler system is permanently installed, as opposed to a hose-end
sprinkler, which is portable. Sprinkler systems are installed in residential
lawns, in commercial landscapes, for churches and schools, in public parks and
cemeteries, and on golf_courses. Most of the components of these irrigation
systems are hidden under ground, since aesthetics are important in a landscape.
A typical lawn sprinkler system will consist of one or more zones, limited in
size by the capacity of the water source. Each zone will cover a designated
portion of the landscape. Sections of the landscape will usually be divided by
microclimate, type of plant material, and type of irrigation equipment. A
landscape irrigation system may also include zones containing drip irrigation,
bubblers, or other types of equipment besides sprinklers.
Although manual systems are still used, most lawn sprinkler systems may be
operated automatically using an irrigation_controller, sometimes called a clock
or timer. Most automatic systems employ electric solenoid_valves. Each zone has
one or more of these valves that are wired to the controller. When the
controller sends power to the valve, the valve opens, allowing water to flow to
the sprinklers in that zone.
There are two main types of sprinklers used in lawn irrigation, pop-up spray
heads and rotors. Spray heads have a fixed spray pattern, while rotors have one
or more streams that rotate. Spray heads are used to cover smaller areas, while
rotors are used for larger areas. Golf course rotors are sometimes so large
that a single sprinkler is combined with a valve and called a 'valve in head'.
When used in a turf area, the sprinklers are installed with the top of the head
flush with the ground surface. When the system is pressurized, the head will
pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and
shuts off that zone. Once there is no more pressure in the lateral line, the
sprinkler head will retract back into the ground. In flower beds or shrub
areas, sprinklers may be mounted on above ground risers or even taller pop-up
sprinklers may be used and installed flush as in a lawn area.

*** Hose-end sprinklers[edit] ***
There are many types of hose-end sprinklers. Many of them are smaller versions
of larger agricultural and landscape sprinklers, sized to work with a typical
garden hose. Some have a spiked base allowing them to be temporarily stuck in
the ground, while others have a sled base designed to be dragged while attached
to the hose.
**** Subirrigation[edit] ****
Subirrigation has been used for many years in field crops in areas with high
water_tables. It is a method of artificially raising the water table to allow
the soil to be moistened from below the plants' root zone. Often those systems
are located on permanent grasslands in lowlands or river valleys and combined
with drainage infrastructure. A system of pumping stations, canals, weirs and
gates allows it to increase or decrease the water level in a network of ditches
and thereby control the water table.
Subirrigation is also used in the commercial greenhouse production, usually for
potted_plants. Water is delivered from below, absorbed by upwards, and the
excess collected for recycling. Typically, a solution of water and nutrients
floods a container or flows through a trough for a short period of time,
10â20 minutes, and is then pumped back into a holding tank for reuse. Sub-
irrigation in greenhouses requires fairly sophisticated, expensive equipment
and management. Advantages are water and nutrient conservation, and labor
savings through reduced system maintenance and automation. It is similar in
principle and action to subsurface basin irrigation.
Another type of subirrigation is the self-watering container, also known as a
sub-irrigated_planter. This consists of a planter suspended over a reservoir
with some type of wicking material such as a polyester rope. The water is drawn
up the wick through capillary action.[38][39] A similar technique is the
wicking_bed; this too uses capillary action.
*** Subsurface textile irrigation[edit] ***
Main article: Subsurface_textile_irrigation
Diagram showing the structure of an example SSTI installation
Subsurface Textile Irrigation (SSTI) is a technology designed specifically for
subirrigation in all soil textures from desert sands to heavy clays. A typical
subsurface textile irrigation system has an impermeable base layer (usually
polyethylene or polypropylene), a drip line running along that base, a layer of
geotextile on top of the drip line and, finally, a narrow impermeable layer on
top of the geotextile (see diagram). Unlike standard drip irrigation, the
spacing of emitters in the drip pipe is not critical as the geotextile moves
the water along the fabric up to 2 m from the dripper. The impermeable layer
effectively creates an artificial water table.
***** Water sources[edit] *****
Irrigation is underway by pump-enabled extraction directly from the_Gumti, seen
in the background, in Comilla, Bangladesh.
Irrigation water can come from groundwater (extracted from springs or by using
wells), from surface water (withdrawn from rivers, lakes or reservoirs) or from
non-conventional sources like treated_wastewater, desalinated_water, drainage
water, or fog_collection. A special form of irrigation using surface water is
spate_irrigation, also called floodwater_harvesting. In case of a flood
(spate), water is diverted to normally dry river beds (wadis) using a network
of dams, gates and channels and spread over large areas. The moisture stored in
the soil will be used thereafter to grow crops. Spate irrigation areas are in
particular located in semi-arid or arid, mountainous regions. While floodwater
harvesting belongs to the accepted irrigation methods, rainwater_harvesting is
usually not considered as a form of irrigation. Rainwater harvesting is the
collection of runoff water from roofs or unused land and the concentration of
this.
Around 90% of wastewater produced globally remains untreated, causing
widespread water pollution, especially in low-income countries. Increasingly,
agriculture uses untreated wastewater as a source of irrigation water. Cities
provide lucrative markets for fresh produce, so are attractive to farmers.
However, because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce water
resources with industry and municipal users (see Water scarcity below), there
is often no alternative for farmers but to use water polluted with urban waste,
including sewage, directly to water their crops. Significant health hazards can
result from using water loaded with pathogens in this way, especially if people
eat raw vegetables that have been irrigated with the polluted water. The
International_Water_Management_Institute has worked in India, Pakistan,
Vietnam, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mexico and other countries on various projects aimed
at assessing and reducing risks of wastewater irrigation. They advocate a
'multiple-barrier' approach to wastewater use, where farmers are encouraged to
adopt various risk-reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few
days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight, applying
water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw,
cleaning vegetables with disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming
to dry before being used as a human manure.[40] The World_Health_Organization
has developed guidelines for safe water use.
There are numerous benefits of using recycled_water for irrigation, including
the low cost (when compared to other sources, particularly in an urban area),
consistency of supply (regardless of season, climatic conditions and associated
water restrictions), and general consistency of quality. Irrigation of recycled
wastewater is also considered as a means for plant fertilization and
particularly nutrient supplementation. This approach carries with it a risk of
soil and water pollution through excessive wastewater application. Hence, a
detailed understanding of soil water conditions is essential for effective
utilization of wastewater for irrigation.[41]
In countries where humid air sweeps through at night, water can be obtained by
condensation onto cold surfaces. This is practiced in the vineyards at
Lanzarote using stones to condense water. Fog collectors are also made of
canvas or foil sheets. Using condensate from air conditioning units as a water
source is also becoming more popular in large urban areas.

***** Efficiency[edit] *****
Modern irrigation methods are efficient enough to supply the entire field
uniformly with water, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs,
neither too much nor too little.[42] Water use efficiency in the field can be
determined as follows:
    * Field Water Efficiency (%) = (Water Transpired by Crop Ã· Water Applied
      to Field) x 100
Until 1960s, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At
that time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the
planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate
less_meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a
third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the
competition for water_resources is much more intense. This is because there are
now more_than_seven_billion_people on the planet, their consumption of water-
thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for
water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel_crops. To avoid a global water
crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing
demands_for_food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more
efficiently.[43]
Successful agriculture is dependent upon farmers having sufficient access to
water. However, water scarcity is already a critical constraint to farming in
many parts of the world. With regards to agriculture, the World_Bank targets
food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that is
fostering a growing debate.[44] Physical_water_scarcity is where there is not
enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to
function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water
scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are
over-committed. This can happen where there is overdevelopment of hydraulic
infrastructure, usually for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity
include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Economic scarcity,
meanwhile, is caused by a lack of investment in water or insufficient human
capacity to satisfy the demand for water. Symptoms of economic_water_scarcity
include a lack of infrastructure, with people often having to fetch water from
rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Some 2.8 billion people currently
live in water-scarce areas.[45]
***** Technical challenges[edit] *****
Main article: Environmental_impact_of_irrigation
Irrigation schemes involve solving numerous engineering and economic problems
while minimizing negative environmental impact.[46]
    * Competition for surface water_rights.[47]
    * Overdrafting (depletion) of underground aquifers. In the mid-20th
      century, the advent of diesel and electric motors led to systems that
      could pump groundwater out of major aquifers faster than drainage_basins
      could refill them. This can lead to permanent loss of aquifer capacity,
      decreased water quality, ground subsidence, and other problems. The
      future of food production in such areas as the North_China_Plain, the
      Punjab, and the Great_Plains of the US is threatened by this phenomenon.
      [48][49]
    * Ground subsidence (e.g. New_Orleans,_Louisiana)
    * Underirrigation or irrigation giving only just enough water for the plant
      (e.g. in drip line irrigation) gives poor soil_salinity_control which
      leads to increased soil_salinity with consequent buildup of toxic salts
      on soil surface in areas with high evaporation. This requires either
      leaching to remove these salts and a method of drainage to carry the
      salts away. When using drip lines, the leaching is best done regularly at
      certain intervals (with only a slight excess of water), so that the salt
      is flushed back under the plant's roots.[50][51]
    * Overirrigation because of poor distribution_uniformity or management
      wastes water, chemicals, and may lead to water_pollution.[52]
    * Deep drainage (from over-irrigation) may result in rising water tables
      which in some instances will lead to problems of irrigation salinity
      requiring watertable_control by some form of subsurface_land_drainage.
      [53][54]
    * Irrigation with saline or high-sodium water may damage soil structure
      owing to the formation of alkaline_soil
    * Clogging of filters: It is mostly algae that clog filters, drip
      installations and nozzles. UV[55] and ultrasonic[56] method can be used
      for algae control in irrigation systems.
    * Assisting smallholders in sustainably and collectively managing
      irrigation technology and changes in technology[57].
***** Impact on society[edit] *****
A 2016 study found that countries whose agriculture depended on irrigation are
more likely to be autocratic than other countries. The authors of the study
"argue that the effect has historical origins: irrigation allowed landed elites
in arid areas to monopolize water and arable land. This made elites more
powerful and better able to oppose democratization."[58]
