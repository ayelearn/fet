Mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of either one
electron or a pair of electrons in an atom
The shapes of the first five atomic orbitals are: 1s, 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz.
The two colors show the phase or sign of the wave function in each region.
These are graphs of Ï(x,ây,âz) functions which depend on the coordinates
of one electron. To see the elongated shape of Ï(x,ây,âz)2 functions that

In atomic_theory and quantum_mechanics, an atomic orbital is a mathematical
function that describes the wave-like behavior of either one electron or a pair
of electrons in an atom.[1] This function can be used to calculate the
probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around
the atom's_nucleus. The term atomic orbital may also refer to the physical
region or space where the electron can be calculated to be present, as defined
by the particular mathematical form of the orbital.[2]
Each orbital in an atom is characterized by a unique set of values of the three
quantum_numbers n, â, and m, which respectively correspond to the electron's
energy, angular_momentum, and an angular momentum vector_component (the
magnetic_quantum_number). Each such orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two
electrons, each with its own spin_quantum_number s. The simple names s orbital,
p orbital, d orbital and f orbital refer to orbitals with angular momentum
quantum number â = 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. These names, together with the
value of n, are used to describe the electron_configurations of atoms. They are
derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of
alkali_metal spectroscopic_lines as sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental.
Orbitals for â > 3 continue alphabetically, omitting j (g, h, i, k, ...)[3]
[4][5] because some languages do not distinguish between the letters "i" and
"j".[6]
Atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of the atomic orbital model
(alternatively known as the electron cloud or wave mechanics model), a modern
framework for visualizing the submicroscopic behavior of electrons in matter.
In this model the electron cloud of a multi-electron atom may be seen as being
built up (in approximation) in an electron configuration that is a product of
simpler hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. The repeating periodicity of the blocks
of 2, 6, 10, and 14 elements within sections of the periodic_table arises
naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of s,
p, d and f atomic orbitals, respectively, although for higher values of the
quantum number n, particularly when the atom in question bears a positive
charge, the energies of certain sub-shells become very similar and so the order
in which they are said to be populated by electrons (e.g. Cr = [Ar]4s13d5 and
Cr2+ = [Ar]3d4) can only be rationalized somewhat arbitrarily.

***** Electron properties[edit] *****
With the development of quantum_mechanics and experimental findings (such as
the two slit diffraction of electrons), it was found that the orbiting
electrons around a nucleus could not be fully described as particles, but
needed to be explained by the wave-particle_duality. In this sense, the
electrons have the following properties:
Wave-like properties:
   1. The electrons do not orbit the nucleus in the manner of a planet orbiting
      the sun, but instead exist as standing_waves. Thus the lowest possible
      energy an electron can take is similar to the fundamental_frequency of a
      wave on a string. Higher energy states are similar to harmonics of that
      fundamental frequency.
   2. The electrons are never in a single point location, although the
      probability of interacting with the electron at a single point can be
      found from the wave function of the electron. The charge on the electron
      acts like it is smeared out in space in a continuous distribution,
      proportional at any point to the squared magnitude of the electron's wave
      function.
Particle-like properties:
   1. The number of electrons orbiting the nucleus can only be an integer.
   2. Electrons jump between orbitals like particles. For example, if a single
      photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in
      response to the photon.
   3. The electrons retain particle-like properties such as: each wave state
      has the same electrical charge as its electron particle. Each wave state
      has a single discrete spin (spin up or spin down) depending on its
      superposition.
Thus, despite the popular analogy to planets revolving around the Sun,
electrons cannot be described simply as solid particles. In addition, atomic
orbitals do not closely resemble a planet's elliptical path in ordinary atoms.
A more accurate analogy might be that of a large and often oddly shaped
"atmosphere" (the electron), distributed around a relatively tiny planet (the
atomic nucleus). Atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this
"atmosphere" only when a single electron is present in an atom. When more
electrons are added to a single atom, the additional electrons tend to more
evenly fill in a volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting
collection (sometimes termed the atom's "electron cloud"[7]) tends toward a
generally spherical zone of probability describing the electron's location,
because of the uncertainty_principle.
**** Formal quantum mechanical definition[edit] ****
Atomic orbitals may be defined more precisely in formal quantum_mechanical
language. Specifically, in quantum mechanics, the state of an atom, i.e., an
eigenstate of the atomic Hamiltonian, is approximated by an expansion (see
configuration_interaction expansion and basis_set) into linear_combinations of
anti-symmetrized products (Slater_determinants) of one-electron functions. The
spatial components of these one-electron functions are called atomic orbitals.
(When one considers also their spin component, one speaks of atomic spin
orbitals.) A state is actually a function of the coordinates of all the
electrons, so that their motion is correlated, but this is often approximated
by this independent-particle_model of products of single electron wave
functions.[8] (The London_dispersion_force, for example, depends on the
correlations of the motion of the electrons.)
In atomic_physics, the atomic_spectral_lines correspond to transitions (quantum
leaps) between quantum_states of an atom. These states are labeled by a set of
quantum_numbers summarized in the term_symbol and usually associated with
particular electron configurations, i.e., by occupation schemes of atomic
orbitals (for example, 1s2 2s2 2p6 for the ground state of neonâterm symbol:
1S0).
This notation means that the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear
higher weight in the configuration_interaction expansion. The atomic orbital
concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process
associated with a given transition. For example, one can say for a given
transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an
occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has to keep
in mind that electrons are fermions ruled by the Pauli_exclusion_principle and
cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it
sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very
slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at
all. This is the case when electron_correlation is large.
Fundamentally, an atomic orbital is a one-electron wave function, even though
most electrons do not exist in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view
is an approximation. When thinking about orbitals, we are often given an
orbital visualization heavily influenced by the HartreeâFock approximation,
which is one way to reduce the complexities of molecular_orbital_theory.
**** Types of orbitals[edit] ****
3D views of some hydrogen-like atomic orbitals showing probability density and
phase (g orbitals and higher are not shown)
Atomic orbitals can be the hydrogen-like "orbitals" which are exact solutions
to the SchrÃ¶dinger_equation for a hydrogen-like_"atom" (i.e., an atom with one
electron). Alternatively, atomic orbitals refer to functions that depend on the
coordinates of one electron (i.e., orbitals) but are used as starting points
for approximating wave functions that depend on the simultaneous coordinates of
all the electrons in an atom or molecule. The coordinate_systems chosen for
atomic orbitals are usually spherical_coordinates (r,âÎ¸,âÏ) in atoms and
cartesians (x,ây,âz) in polyatomic molecules. The advantage of spherical
coordinates (for atoms) is that an orbital wave function is a product of three
factors each dependent on a single coordinate: Ï(r,âÎ¸,âÏ) = R(r)âÎ
(Î¸)âÎ¦(Ï). The angular factors of atomic orbitals Î(Î¸)âÎ¦(Ï) generate
s, p, d, etc. functions as real_combinations of spherical_harmonics Yâm
(Î¸,âÏ) (where â and m are quantum numbers). There are typically three
mathematical forms for the radial functions R(r) which can be chosen as a
starting point for the calculation of the properties of atoms and molecules
with many electrons:
   1. The hydrogen-like atomic orbitals are derived from the exact solution of
      the SchrÃ¶dinger Equation for one electron and a nucleus, for a hydrogen-
      like_atom. The part of the function that depends on the distance r from
      the nucleus has nodes (radial nodes) and decays as eâ(constant_Ã
      distance).
   2. The Slater-type_orbital (STO) is a form without radial nodes but decays
      from the nucleus as does the hydrogen-like orbital.
   3. The form of the Gaussian_type_orbital (Gaussians) has no radial nodes and
      decays as      e  &#x2212; &#x03B1;  r  2       {\displaystyle e^{-\alpha
      r^{2}}}  [{\displaystyle e^{-\alpha r^{2}}}].
Although hydrogen-like orbitals are still used as pedagogical tools, the advent
of computers has made STOs preferable for atoms and diatomic molecules since
combinations of STOs can replace the nodes in hydrogen-like atomic orbital.
Gaussians are typically used in molecules with three or more atoms. Although
not as accurate by themselves as STOs, combinations of many Gaussians can
attain the accuracy of hydrogen-like orbitals.
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: Atomic_theory
The term "orbital" was coined by Robert_Mulliken in 1932 as an abbreviation for
one-electron orbital wave function.[9] However, the idea that electrons might
revolve around a compact nucleus with definite angular momentum was
convincingly argued at least 19 years earlier by Niels_Bohr,[10] and the
Japanese physicist Hantaro_Nagaoka published an orbit-based hypothesis for
electronic behavior as early as 1904.[11] Explaining the behavior of these
electron "orbits" was one of the driving forces behind the development of
quantum_mechanics.[12]
**** Early models[edit] ****
With J._J._Thomson's discovery of the electron in 1897,[13] it became clear
that atoms were not the smallest building blocks of nature, but were rather
composite particles. The newly discovered structure within atoms tempted many
to imagine how the atom's constituent parts might interact with each other.
Thomson theorized that multiple electrons revolved in orbit-like rings within a
positively charged jelly-like substance,[14] and between the electron's
discovery and 1909, this "plum_pudding_model" was the most widely accepted
explanation of atomic structure.
Shortly after Thomson's discovery, Hantaro_Nagaoka predicted a different model
for electronic structure.[11] Unlike the plum pudding model, the positive
charge in Nagaoka's "Saturnian Model" was concentrated into a central core,
pulling the electrons into circular orbits reminiscent of Saturn's rings. Few
people took notice of Nagaoka's work at the time,[15] and Nagaoka himself
recognized a fundamental defect in the theory even at its conception, namely
that a classical charged object cannot sustain orbital motion because it is
accelerating and therefore loses energy due to electromagnetic radiation.[16]
Nevertheless, the Saturnian_model turned out to have more in common with modern
theory than any of its contemporaries.
**** Bohr atom[edit] ****
In 1909, Ernest_Rutherford discovered that the bulk of the atomic mass was
tightly condensed into a nucleus, which was also found to be positively
charged. It became clear from his analysis in 1911 that the plum pudding model
could not explain atomic structure. In 1913 as Rutherford's post-doctoral
student, Niels_Bohr proposed a new model of the atom, wherein electrons orbited
the nucleus with classical periods, but were only permitted to have discrete
values of angular momentum, quantized in units h/2Ï.[10] This constraint
automatically permitted only certain values of electron energies. The Bohr
model of the atom fixed the problem of energy loss from radiation from a ground
state (by declaring that there was no state below this), and more importantly
explained the origin of spectral lines.
The RutherfordâBohr_model of the hydrogen atom.
After Bohr's use of Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric_effect to
relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light, the
connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the emission and
absorption_spectra of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the
understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and
absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century),
was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. The significance of the
Bohr model was that it related the lines in emission and absorption spectra to
the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an
atom. This was, however, not achieved by Bohr through giving the electrons some
kind of wave-like properties, since the idea that electrons could behave as
matter_waves was not suggested until eleven years later. Still, the Bohr
model's use of quantized angular momenta and therefore quantized energy levels
was a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms, and
also a significant step towards the development of quantum_mechanics in
suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy
levels and spectra in atoms.
With de_Broglie's suggestion of the existence of electron matter waves in 1924,
and for a short time before the full 1926 SchrÃ¶dinger_equation treatment of
hydrogen-like_atom, a Bohr electron "wavelength" could be seen to be a function
of its momentum, and thus a Bohr orbiting electron was seen to orbit in a
circle at a multiple of its half-wavelength (this physically incorrect Bohr
model is still often taught to beginning students). The Bohr model for a short
time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided
by the 'wavelength' argument. However, this period was immediately superseded
by the full three-dimensional wave mechanics of 1926. In our current
understanding of physics, the Bohr model is called a semi-classical model
because of its quantization of angular momentum, not primarily because of its
relationship with electron wavelength, which appeared in hindsight a dozen
years after the Bohr model was proposed.
The Bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of
hydrogen. The energies of electrons in the n = 1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr
model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain
similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such
as the fact that helium (two electrons), neon (10 electrons), and argon (18
electrons) exhibit similar chemical inertness. Modern quantum_mechanics
explains this in terms of electron_shells and subshells which can each hold a
number of electrons determined by the Pauli_exclusion_principle. Thus the n = 1
state can hold one or two electrons, while the n = 2 state can hold up to eight
electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all n = 1 states are fully
occupied; the same for n = 1 and n = 2 in neon. In argon the 3s and 3p
subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics
also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in
argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty.
**** Modern conceptions and connections to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
[edit] ****
Immediately after Heisenberg discovered his uncertainty_principle,[17] Bohr
noted that the existence of any sort of wave_packet implies uncertainty in the
wave frequency and wavelength, since a spread of frequencies is needed to
create the packet itself.[18] In quantum mechanics, where all particle momenta
are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which
localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum
mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the
existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value
in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy. In quantum
mechanics, as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space, the
associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of
momenta, and thus larger kinetic energy. Thus the binding energy to contain or
trap a particle in a smaller region of space increases without bound as the
region of space grows smaller. Particles cannot be restricted to a geometric
point in space, since this would require an infinite particle momentum.
In chemistry, SchrÃ¶dinger, Pauling, Mulliken and others noted that the
consequence of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet,
could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. Max_Born
suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a probability
distribution which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the
wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum
mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the
occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path
of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it, as we cannot with
electrons in an atom.
In the quantum picture of Heisenberg, SchrÃ¶dinger and others, the Bohr atom
number n for each orbital became known as an n-sphere[citation_needed] in a
three dimensional atom and was pictured as the mean energy of the probability
cloud of the electron's wave packet which surrounded the atom.
***** Orbital names[edit] *****
**** Orbital notation[edit] ****
Orbitals have been given names, which are usually given in the form:
         X    t y p e   y   &#xA0;   {\displaystyle X\,\mathrm {type} ^{y}\ }
      [X\,\mathrm {type} ^{y}\ ]
where X is the energy level corresponding to the principal_quantum_number n;
type is a lower-case letter denoting the shape or subshell of the orbital,
corresponding to the angular_quantum_number â; and y is the number of
electrons in that orbital.
For example, the orbital 1s2 (pronounced as the individual numbers and letters:
"one ess two") has two electrons and is the lowest energy level (n = 1) and has
an angular quantum number of â = 0, denoted as s.
**** X-ray notation[edit] ****
Main article: X-ray_notation
There is also another, less common system still used in X-ray science known as
X-ray_notation, which is a continuation of the notations used before orbital
theory was well understood. In this system, the principal quantum number is
given a letter associated with it. For n = 1,â2,â3,â4,â5,ââ¦, the
letters associated with those numbers are K, L, M, N, O, ... respectively.
***** Hydrogen-like orbitals[edit] *****
Main article: Hydrogen-like_atom
The simplest atomic orbitals are those that are calculated for systems with a
single electron, such as the hydrogen_atom. An atom of any other element
ionized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals
take the same form. In the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for this system of one
negative and one positive particle, the atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian_operator for the energy. They can be obtained analytically,
meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series, and
exponential and trigonometric functions. (see hydrogen_atom).
For atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equations can only be
solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation. Orbitals of multi-
electron atoms are qualitatively similar to those of hydrogen, and in the
simplest models, they are taken to have the same form. For more rigorous and
precise analysis, numerical approximations must be used.
A given (hydrogen-like) atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three
quantum numbers: n, â, and mâ. The rules restricting the values of the
quantum numbers, and their energies (see below), explain the electron
configuration of the atoms and the periodic_table.
The stationary states (quantum_states) of the hydrogen-like atoms are its
atomic orbitals.[clarification_needed] However, in general, an electron's
behavior is not fully described by a single orbital. Electron states are best
represented by time-depending "mixtures" (linear_combinations) of multiple
orbitals. See Linear_combination_of_atomic_orbitals_molecular_orbital_method.
The quantum number n first appeared in the Bohr_model where it determines the
radius of each circular electron orbit. In modern quantum mechanics however, n
determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons
with the same value of n lie at the same average distance. For this reason,
orbitals with the same value of n are said to comprise a "shell". Orbitals with
the same value of n and also the same value of â are even more closely
related, and are said to comprise a "subshell".
***** Quantum numbers[edit] *****
Main article: Quantum_number
Because of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons around a nucleus,
atomic orbitals can be uniquely defined by a set of integers known as quantum
numbers. These quantum numbers only occur in certain combinations of values,
and their physical interpretation changes depending on whether real or complex
versions of the atomic orbitals are employed.
**** Complex orbitals[edit] ****
In physics, the most common orbital descriptions are based on the solutions to
the hydrogen atom, where orbitals are given by the product between a radial
function and a pure spherical harmonic. The quantum numbers, together with the
rules governing their possible values, are as follows:
The principal_quantum_number n describes the energy of the electron and is
always a positive_integer. In fact, it can be any positive integer, but for
reasons discussed below, large numbers are seldom encountered. Each atom has,
in general, many orbitals associated with each value of n; these orbitals
together are sometimes called electron_shells.
The azimuthal_quantum_number â describes the orbital angular momentum of each
electron and is a non-negative integer. Within a shell where n is some integer
n0, â ranges across all (integer) values satisfying the relation     0
&#x2264; &#x2113; &#x2264;  n  0   &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle 0\leq \ell \leq
n_{0}-1}  [0\leq \ell \leq n_{0}-1]. For instance, the n = 1 shell has only
orbitals with     &#x2113; = 0   {\displaystyle \ell =0}  [\ell =0], and the n
= 2 shell has only orbitals with     &#x2113; = 0   {\displaystyle \ell =0}
[\ell =0], and     &#x2113; = 1   {\displaystyle \ell =1}  [\ell =1]. The set
of orbitals associated with a particular value of â are sometimes
collectively called a subshell.
The magnetic_quantum_number,      m  &#x2113;     {\displaystyle m_{\ell }}
[m_{\ell }], describes the magnetic moment of an electron in an arbitrary
direction, and is also always an integer. Within a subshell where     &#x2113;
{\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ] is some integer      &#x2113;  0
{\displaystyle \ell _{0}}  [\ell _{0}],      m  &#x2113;     {\displaystyle m_
{\ell }}  [m_{\ell }] ranges thus:     &#x2212;  &#x2113;  0   &#x2264;  m
&#x2113;   &#x2264;  &#x2113;  0     {\displaystyle -\ell _{0}\leq m_{\ell
}\leq \ell _{0}}  [-\ell _{0}\leq m_{\ell }\leq \ell _{0}].
The above results may be summarized in the following table. Each cell
represents a subshell, and lists the values of      m  &#x2113;
{\displaystyle m_{\ell }}  [m_{\ell }] available in that subshell. Empty cells
represent subshells that do not exist.
    â = 0     â = 1 â = 2          â = 3                   â = 4                            ...
        m
n = &#x2113;   = 0

    m_{\ell }=0}
    [m_{\ell }=0]

n = 0              â1, 0,â2, â1, 0, 1, 2

n = 0              â1, 0,â2, â1, 0,â3, â2, â1, 0, 1, 2, 3

... ...            ...        ...                 ...                          ...                                   ...
Subshells are usually identified by their     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n]- and
&#x2113;   {\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ]-values.     n   {\displaystyle n}
[n] is represented by its numerical value, but     &#x2113;   {\displaystyle
\ell }  [\ell ] is represented by a letter as follows: 0 is represented by 's',
1 by 'p', 2 by 'd', 3 by 'f', and 4 by 'g'. For instance, one may speak of the
subshell with     n = 2   {\displaystyle n=2}  [n=2] and     &#x2113; = 0
{\displaystyle \ell =0}  [\ell =0] as a '2s subshell'.
Each electron also has a spin_quantum_number, s, which describes the spin of
each electron (spin up or spin down). The number s can be +1/2 or â1/2.
The Pauli_exclusion_principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have
the same values of all four quantum numbers. If there are two electrons in an
orbital with given values for three quantum numbers, (n, l, m), these two
electrons must differ in their spin.
The above conventions imply a preferred axis (for example, the z direction in
Cartesian coordinates), and they also imply a preferred direction along this
preferred axis. Otherwise there would be no sense in distinguishing m = +1 from
m = â1. As such, the model is most useful when applied to physical systems
that share these symmetries. The SternâGerlach_experiment â where an atom
is exposed to a magnetic field â provides one such example.[19]
**** Real orbitals[edit] ****
Animation of continuously varying superpositions between the      p  1
{\displaystyle p_{1}}  [p_{1}] and the      p  x     {\displaystyle p_{x}}  [p_
{x}] orbitals.
An atom that is embedded in a crystalline solid feels multiple preferred axes,
but often no preferred direction. Instead of building atomic orbitals out of
the product of radial functions and a single spherical_harmonic, linear
combinations of spherical harmonics are typically used, designed so that the
imaginary part of the spherical harmonics cancel out. These real orbitals are
the building blocks most commonly shown in orbital visualizations.
In the real hydrogen-like orbitals, for example, n and â have the same
interpretation and significance as their complex counterparts, but m is no
longer a good quantum number (though its absolute value is). The orbitals are
given new names based on their shape with respect to a standardized Cartesian
basis. The real hydrogen-like p orbitals are given by the following[20][21]
          p  z   =  p  0     {\displaystyle p_{z}=p_{0}}  [p_{z}=p_{0}]
          p  x   =   1  2     (   p  1   +  p  &#x2212; 1    )
      {\displaystyle p_{x}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}\left(p_{1}+p_{-1}\right)}
      [p_{x}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}\left(p_{1}+p_{-1}\right)]
          p  y   =   1  i   2       (   p  1   &#x2212;  p  &#x2212; 1    )
      {\displaystyle p_{y}={\frac {1}{i{\sqrt {2}}}}\left(p_{1}-p_{-1}\right)}
      [p_{y}={\frac {1}{i{\sqrt {2}}}}\left(p_{1}-p_{-1}\right)]
where p0 = Rnâ1âY1â0, p1 = Rnâ1âY1â1, and pâ1 =
Rnâ1âY1ââ1, are the complex orbitals corresponding to â = 1.
The equations for the px and py orbitals depend on the phase convention used
for the spherical harmonics. The above equations suppose that the spherical
harmonics are defined by      Y  &#x2113;   m   ( &#x03B8; , &#x03C6; ) = N  e
i m &#x03C6;    P  &#x2113;   m   ( cos &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  )   {\displaystyle
Y_{\ell }^{m}(\theta ,\varphi )=Ne^{im\varphi }P_{\ell }^{m}(\cos {\theta })}
[Y_{\ell }^{m}(\theta ,\varphi )=Ne^{im\varphi }P_{\ell }^{m}(\cos {\theta })].
However some quantum physicists[22][23] include a phase factor (-1)m in these
definitions, which has the effect of relating the px orbital to a difference of
spherical harmonics and the py orbital to the corresponding sum. (For more
detail, see Spherical_harmonics#Conventions).
***** Shapes of orbitals[edit] *****
Transparent cloud view of a computed 6s (n = 6, â = 0, m = 0) hydrogen atom
orbital. The s orbitals, though spherically symmetrical, have radially placed
wave-nodes for n > 1. Only s orbitals invariably have a center anti-node; the
other types never do.
Simple pictures showing orbital shapes are intended to describe the angular
forms of regions in space where the electrons occupying the orbital are likely
to be found. The diagrams cannot show the entire region where an electron can
be found, since according to quantum mechanics there is a non-zero probability
of finding the electron (almost) anywhere in space. Instead the diagrams are
approximate representations of boundary or contour_surfaces where the
probability density |âÏ(r,âÎ¸,âÏ)â|2 has a constant value, chosen so
that there is a certain probability (for example 90%) of finding the electron
within the contour. Although |âÏâ|2 as the square of an absolute_value is
everywhere non-negative, the sign of the wave_function Ï(r,âÎ¸,âÏ) is
often indicated in each subregion of the orbital picture.
Sometimes the Ï function will be graphed to show its phases, rather than the
|âÏ(r,âÎ¸,âÏ)â|2 which shows probability density but has no phases
(which have been lost in the process of taking the absolute value, since Ï
(r,âÎ¸,âÏ) is a complex number). |âÏ(r,âÎ¸,âÏ)â|2 orbital graphs
tend to have less spherical, thinner lobes than Ï(r,âÎ¸,âÏ) graphs, but
have the same number of lobes in the same places, and otherwise are
recognizable. This article, in order to show wave function phases, shows mostly
Ï(r,âÎ¸,âÏ) graphs.
The lobes can be viewed as standing_wave interference patterns between the two
counter rotating, ring resonant travelling_wave "m" and "âm" modes, with the
projection of the orbital onto the xy plane having a resonant "m" wavelengths
around the circumference. Though rarely depicted the travelling wave solutions
can be viewed as rotating banded tori, with the bands representing phase
information. For each m there are two standing wave solutions
â¨mâ©+â¨âmâ© and â¨mâ©ââ¨âmâ©. For the case where m = 0 the
orbital is vertical, counter rotating information is unknown, and the orbital
is z-axis symmetric. For the case where â = 0 there are no counter rotating
modes. There are only radial modes and the shape is spherically symmetric. For
any given n, the smaller â is, the more radial nodes there are. Loosely
speaking n is energy, â is analogous to eccentricity, and m is orientation.
In the classical case, a ring resonant travelling wave, for example in a
circular transmission line, unless actively forced, will spontaneously decay
into a ring resonant standing wave because reflections will build up over time
at even the smallest imperfection or discontinuity.
Generally speaking, the number n determines the size and energy of the orbital
for a given nucleus: as n increases, the size of the orbital increases. When
comparing different elements, the higher nuclear charge Z of heavier elements
causes their orbitals to contract by comparison to lighter ones, so that the
overall size of the whole atom remains very roughly constant, even as the
number of electrons in heavier elements (higher Z) increases.
Experimentally imaged 1s and 2p core-electron orbitals of Sr, including the
effects of atomic thermal vibrations and excitation broadening, retrieved from
energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM).[24]
Also in general terms, â determines an orbital's shape, and mâ its
orientation. However, since some orbitals are described by equations in complex
numbers, the shape sometimes depends on mâ also. Together, the whole set of
orbitals for a given â and n fill space as symmetrically as possible, though
with increasingly complex sets of lobes and nodes.
The single s-orbitals (    &#x2113; = 0   {\displaystyle \ell =0}  [\ell =0])
are shaped like spheres. For n = 1 it is roughly a solid_ball (it is most dense
at the center and fades exponentially outwardly), but for n = 2 or more, each
single s-orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested
shells (i.e., the "wave-structure" is radial, following a sinusoidal radial
component as well). See illustration of a cross-section of these nested shells,
at right. The s-orbitals for all n numbers are the only orbitals with an anti-
node (a region of high wave function density) at the center of the nucleus. All
other orbitals (p, d, f, etc.) have angular momentum, and thus avoid the
nucleus (having a wave node at the nucleus). Recently, there has been an effort
to experimentally image the 1s and 2p orbitals in a SrTiO3 crystal using
scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy.[24] Because the imaging was conducted using an electron beam,
Coulombic beam-orbital interaction that is often termed as the impact parameter
effect is included in the final outcome (see the figure at right).
The shapes of p, d and f-orbitals are described verbally here and shown
graphically in the Orbitals table below. The three p-orbitals for n = 2 have
the form of two ellipsoids with a point_of_tangency at the nucleus (the two-
lobed shape is sometimes referred to as a "dumbbell"âthere are two lobes
pointing in opposite directions from each other). The three p-orbitals in each
shell are oriented at right angles to each other, as determined by their
respective linear combination of values of mâ. The overall result is a lobe
pointing along each direction of the primary axes.
Four of the five d-orbitals for n = 3 look similar, each with four pear-shaped
lobes, each lobe tangent at right angles to two others, and the centers of all
four lying in one plane. Three of these planes are the xy-, xz-, and yz-
planesâthe lobes are between the pairs of primary axesâand the fourth has
the centres along the x and y axes themselves. The fifth and final d-orbital
consists of three regions of high probability density: a torus with two pear-
shaped regions placed symmetrically on its z axis. The overall total of 18
directional lobes point in every primary axis direction and between every pair.
There are seven f-orbitals, each with shapes more complex than those of the d-
orbitals.
Additionally, as is the case with the s orbitals, individual p, d, f and g
orbitals with n values higher than the lowest possible value, exhibit an
additional radial node structure which is reminiscent of harmonic waves of the
same type, as compared with the lowest (or fundamental) mode of the wave. As
with s orbitals, this phenomenon provides p, d, f, and g orbitals at the next
higher possible value of n (for example, 3p orbitals vs. the fundamental 2p),
an additional node in each lobe. Still higher values of n further increase the
number of radial nodes, for each type of orbital.
The shapes of atomic orbitals in one-electron atom are related to 3-dimensional
spherical_harmonics. These shapes are not unique, and any linear combination is
valid, like a transformation to cubic_harmonics, in fact it is possible to
generate sets where all the d's are the same shape, just like the px, py, and
pz are the same shape.[25][26]
The 1s, 2s, & 2p orbitals of a sodium atom.
Although individual orbitals are most often shown independent of each other,
the orbitals coexist around the nucleus at the same time. Also, in 1927,
Albrecht_UnsÃ¶ld proved that if one sums the electron density of all orbitals
of a particular azimuthal quantum number â of the same shell n (e.g. all
three 2p orbitals, or all five 3d orbitals) where each orbital is occupied by
an electron or each is occupied by an electron pair, then all angular
dependence disappears; that is, the resulting total density of all the atomic
orbitals in that subshell (those with the same â) is spherical. This is known
as UnsÃ¶ld's_theorem.
**** Orbitals table[edit] ****
This table shows all orbital configurations for the real hydrogen-like wave
functions up to 7s, and therefore covers the simple electronic configuration
for all elements in the periodic table up to radium. "Ï" graphs are shown with
â and + wave_function phases shown in two different colors (arbitrarily red
and blue). The pz orbital is the same as the p0 orbital, but the px and py are
formed by taking linear combinations of the p+1 and pâ1 orbitals (which is
why they are listed under the m = Â±1 label). Also, the p+1 and pâ1 are not
the same shape as the p0, since they are pure spherical_harmonics.

**** Qualitative understanding of shapes[edit] ****
The shapes of atomic orbitals can be qualitatively understood by considering
the analogous case of standing_waves_on_a_circular_drum.[27] To see the
analogy, the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from
the equilibrium point over many cycles (a measure of average drum membrane
velocity and momentum at that point) must be considered relative to that
point's distance from the center of the drum head. If this displacement is
taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given
distance from the nucleus, then it will be seen that the many modes of the
vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals.
The basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution
of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter-wave is predictive of where the
particle associated with the wave will be. That is, the probability of finding
an electron at a given place is also a function of the electron's average
momentum at that point, since high electron momentum at a given position tends
to "localize" the electron in that position, via the properties of electron
wave-packets (see the Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle for details of the
mechanism).
This relationship means that certain key features can be observed in both drum
membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous
to s orbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), it can be seen
that the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding
to the antinode in all s orbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron
is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes
straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on
average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.
A mental "planetary orbit" picture closest to the behavior of electrons in
s orbitals, all of which have no angular momentum, might perhaps be that of a
Keplerian_orbit with the orbital_eccentricity of 1 but a finite major axis, not
physically possible (because particles were to collide), but can be imagined as
a limit of orbits with equal major axes but increasing eccentricity.
Below, a number of drum membrane vibration modes and the respective wave
functions of the hydrogen atom are shown. A correspondence can be considered
where the wave functions of a vibrating drum head are for a two-coordinate
system Ï(r,âÎ¸) and the wave functions for a vibrating sphere are three-
coordinate Ï(r,âÎ¸,âÏ).
    * s-type drum modes and wave functions
    * Drum mode      u  01     {\displaystyle u_{01}}  [u_{01}]
    * Drum mode      u  02     {\displaystyle u_{02}}  [u_{02}]
    * Drum mode      u  03     {\displaystyle u_{03}}  [u_{03}]
    * Wave function of 1s orbital (real part, 2D-cut,      r  m a x   = 2  a  0
      {\displaystyle r_{max}=2a_{0}}  [{\displaystyle r_{max}=2a_{0}}])
    * Wave function of 2s orbital (real part, 2D-cut,      r  m a x   = 10  a
      0     {\displaystyle r_{max}=10a_{0}}  [{\displaystyle r_{max}=10a_{0}}])
    * Wave function of 3s orbital (real part, 2D-cut,      r  m a x   = 20  a
      0     {\displaystyle r_{max}=20a_{0}}  [{\displaystyle r_{max}=20a_{0}}])
None of the other sets of modes in a drum membrane have a central antinode, and
in all of them the center of the drum does not move. These correspond to a node
at the nucleus for all non-s orbitals in an atom. These orbitals all have some
angular momentum, and in the planetary model, they correspond to particles in
orbit with eccentricity less than 1.0, so that they do not pass straight
through the center of the primary body, but keep somewhat away from it.
In addition, the drum modes analogous to p and d modes in an atom show spatial
irregularity along the different radial directions from the center of the drum,
whereas all of the modes analogous to s modes are perfectly symmetrical in
radial direction. The non radial-symmetry properties of non-s orbitals are
necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an
orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force,
since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no
angular momentum. For these modes, waves in the drum head tend to avoid the
central point. Such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals
are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons.

***** Orbital energy[edit] *****
Main article: Electron_shell
In atoms with a single electron (hydrogen-like_atoms), the energy of an orbital
(and, consequently, of any electrons in the orbital) is determined mainly by
n   {\displaystyle n}  [n]. The     n = 1   {\displaystyle n=1}  [n=1] orbital
has the lowest possible energy in the atom. Each successively higher value of
n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] has a higher level of energy, but the difference
decreases as     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] increases. For high     n
{\displaystyle n}  [n], the level of energy becomes so high that the electron
can easily escape from the atom. In single electron atoms, all levels with
different     &#x2113;   {\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ] within a given     n
{\displaystyle n}  [n] are degenerate in the SchrÃ¶dinger approximation, and
have the same energy. This approximation is broken to a slight extent in the
solution to the Dirac equation (where the energy depends on n and another
quantum number j), and by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus and
quantum_electrodynamics effects. The latter induce tiny binding energy
differences especially for s electrons that go nearer the nucleus, since these
feel a very slightly different nuclear charge, even in one-electron atoms; see
Lamb_shift.
In atoms with multiple electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on
the intrinsic properties of its orbital, but also on its interactions with the
other electrons. These interactions depend on the detail of its spatial
probability distribution, and so the energy_levels of orbitals depend not only
on     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] but also on     &#x2113;   {\displaystyle
\ell }  [\ell ]. Higher values of     &#x2113;   {\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ]
are associated with higher values of energy; for instance, the 2p state is
higher than the 2s state. When     &#x2113; = 2   {\displaystyle \ell =2}
[\ell =2], the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push
the energy of orbital above the energy of the s-orbital in the next higher
shell; when     &#x2113; = 3   {\displaystyle \ell =3}  [\ell =3] the energy is
pushed into the shell two steps higher. The filling of the 3d orbitals does not
occur until the 4s orbitals have been filled.
The increase in energy for subshells of increasing angular momentum in larger
atoms is due to electronâelectron interaction effects, and it is specifically
related to the ability of low angular momentum electrons to penetrate more
effectively toward the nucleus, where they are subject to less screening from
the charge of intervening electrons. Thus, in atoms of higher atomic number,
the     &#x2113;   {\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ] of electrons becomes more and
more of a determining factor in their energy, and the principal quantum numbers
n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] of electrons becomes less and less important in
their energy placement.
The energy sequence of the first 35 subshells (e.g., 1s, 2p, 3d, etc.) is given
in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell with     n
{\displaystyle n}  [n] and     &#x2113;   {\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ] given
by its row and column indices, respectively. The number in the cell is the
subshell's position in the sequence. For a linear listing of the subshells in
terms of increasing energies in multielectron atoms, see the section below.

***** Electron placement and the periodic table[edit] *****
Electron atomic and molecular orbitals. The chart of orbitals (left) is
arranged by increasing energy (see Madelung_rule). Note that atomic orbits are
functions of three variables (two angles, and the distance r from the nucleus).
These images are faithful to the angular component of the orbital, but not
entirely representative of the orbital as a whole.

Atomic orbitals and periodic table construction
Main articles: electron_configuration and electron_shell
Several rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals (electron
configuration). The first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have
the same set of values of quantum numbers (this is the Pauli_exclusion
principle). These quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals, as
well as s, or spin_quantum_number. Thus, two electrons may occupy a single
orbital, so long as they have different values of s. However, only two
electrons, because of their spin, can be associated with each orbital.
Additionally, an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy
state. It is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not
violate the Pauli exclusion principle, but if lower-energy orbitals are
available, this condition is unstable. The electron will eventually lose energy
(by releasing a photon) and drop into the lower orbital. Thus, electrons fill
orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.
This behavior is responsible for the structure of the periodic_table. The table
may be divided into several rows (called 'periods'), numbered starting with 1
at the top. The presently known elements occupy seven periods. If a certain
period has number i, it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in
the ith shell. Niels_Bohr was the first to propose (1923) that the periodicity
in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of
the electron energy levels, resulting in the electronic structure of the atom.
[28]
The periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular
'blocks'. The elements belonging to a given block have this common feature:
their highest-energy electrons all belong to the same â-state (but the n
associated with that â-state depends upon the period). For instance, the
leftmost two columns constitute the 's-block'. The outermost electrons of Li
and Be respectively belong to the 2s subshell, and those of Na and Mg to the
3s subshell.
The following is the order for filling the "subshell" orbitals, which also
gives the order of the "blocks" in the periodic table:
      1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d,
      7p

s, p, d and f "blocks", is more obvious if this order of filling is given in
matrix form, with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows
("periods") in the matrix. Then, each subshell (composed of the first two
quantum numbers) is repeated as many times as required for each pair of
electrons it may contain. The result is a compressed periodic table, with each
entry representing two successive elements:
1s
2s                                                  2p  2p  2p
3s                                                  3p  3p  3p
4s                              3d  3d  3d  3d  3d  4p  4p  4p
5s                              4d  4d  4d  4d  4d  5p  5p  5p
6s  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  5d  5d  5d  5d  5d  6p  6p  6p
7s  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  6d  6d  6d  6d  6d  7p  7p  7p
Although this is the general order of orbital filling according to the Madelung
rule, there are exceptions, and the actual electronic energies of each element
are also dependent upon additional details of the atoms (see Electron
configuration#Atoms:_Aufbau_principle_and_Madelung_rule).
The number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom increases with the
atomic_number. The electrons in the outermost shell, or valence_electrons, tend
to be responsible for an element's chemical behavior. Elements that contain the
same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar
chemical properties.
**** Relativistic effects[edit] ****
Main article: Relativistic_quantum_chemistry
For elements with high atomic number Z, the effects of relativity become more
pronounced, and especially so for s electrons, which move at relativistic
velocities as they penetrate the screening electrons near the core of high-
Z atoms. This relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes
a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of 6s orbitals relative
to 5d orbitals (by comparison to corresponding s and d electrons in lighter
elements in the same column of the periodic table); this results in 6s valence
electrons becoming lowered in energy.
Examples of significant physical outcomes of this effect include the lowered
melting temperature of mercury (which results from 6s electrons not being
available for metal bonding) and the golden color of gold and caesium.[29]
In the Bohr_Model, an n = 1 electron has a velocity given by     v = Z &#x03B1;
c   {\displaystyle v=Z\alpha c}  [v=Z\alpha c], where Z is the atomic number,
&#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is the fine-structure_constant,
and c is the speed of light. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, therefore,
any atom with an atomic number greater than 137 would require its 1s electrons
to be traveling faster than the speed of light. Even in the Dirac_equation,
which accounts for relativistic effects, the wave function of the electron for
atoms with     Z > 137   {\displaystyle Z>137}  [{\displaystyle Z>137}] is
oscillatory and unbounded. The significance of element 137, also known as
untriseptium, was first pointed out by the physicist Richard_Feynman. Element
137 is sometimes informally called feynmanium (symbol Fy).[30] However,
Feynman's approximation fails to predict the exact critical value of Z due to
the non-point-charge nature of the nucleus and very small orbital radius of
inner electrons, resulting in a potential seen by inner electrons which is
effectively less than Z. The critical Z value which makes the atom unstable
with regard to high-field breakdown of the vacuum and production of electron-
positron pairs, does not occur until Z is about 173. These conditions are not
seen except transiently in collisions of very heavy nuclei such as lead or
uranium in accelerators, where such electron-positron production from these
effects has been claimed to be observed. See Extension_of_the_periodic_table
beyond_the_seventh_period.
There are no nodes in relativistic orbital densities, although individual
components of the wave function will have nodes.[31]
***** Transitions between orbitals[edit] *****
Main article: Atomic_electron_transition
Bound quantum states have discrete energy levels. When applied to atomic
orbitals, this means that the energy differences between states are also
discrete. A transition between these states (i.e., an electron absorbing or
emitting a photon) can thus only happen if the photon has an energy
corresponding with the exact energy difference between said states.
Consider two states of the hydrogen atom:
State 1) n = 1, â = 0, mâ = 0 and s = +1/2
State 2) n = 2, â = 0, mâ = 0 and s = +1/2
By quantum theory, state 1 has a fixed energy of E1, and state 2 has a fixed
energy of E2. Now, what would happen if an electron in state 1 were to move to
state 2? For this to happen, the electron would need to gain an energy of
exactly E2 â E1. If the electron receives energy that is less than or greater
than this value, it cannot jump from state 1 to state 2. Now, suppose we
irradiate the atom with a broad-spectrum of light. Photons that reach the atom
that have an energy of exactly E2 â E1 will be absorbed by the electron in
state 1, and that electron will jump to state 2. However, photons that are
greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron, because the
electron can only jump to one of the orbitals, it cannot jump to a state
between orbitals. The result is that only photons of a specific frequency will
be absorbed by the atom. This creates a line in the spectrum, known as an
absorption line, which corresponds to the energy difference between states 1
and 2.
The atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra, which are observed
experimentally. This is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital
model.
The atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum
theory, which only recognizes many electron states. The predictions of line
spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms
and ions other than those containing only one electron.
