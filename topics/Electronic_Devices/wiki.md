Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic (analog or digital)
equipments intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer
electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD
players, video_games, remote_control_cars, etc.), communications (telephones,
cell_phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g.,
desktop_computers, printers, paper_shredders, etc.). In British English, they
are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from
"white_goods" which are meant for housekeeping tasks, such as washing_machines
and refrigerators, although nowadays, these would be considered brown goods,
some of these being connected to the Internet.[1][n_1] In the 2010s, this
distinction is not always present in large big_box consumer_electronics_stores,
such as Best_Buy, which sell both entertainment, communication, and home office
devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators.
Radio_broadcasting in the early 20th century brought the first major consumer
product, the broadcast_receiver. Later products included telephones,
televisions and calculators, then audio and video recorders and players, game
consoles, personal_computers and MP3_players. In the 2010s, consumer
electronics stores often sell GPS, automotive_electronics (car_stereos), video
game_consoles, electronic_musical_instruments (e.g., synthesizer keyboards),
karaoke_machines, digital_cameras, and video players (VCRs in the 1980s and
1990s, followed by DVD_players and Blu-ray_disc players). Stores also sell
smart_appliances, digital_cameras, camcorders, cell_phones, and smartphones.
Some of the newer products sold include virtual_reality head-mounted_display
goggles, smart_home_devices that connect_home_devices_to_the_Internet and
wearable_technology such as Fitbit digital exercise watches and the Apple_Watch
smart_watch.
In the 2010s, most consumer electronics have become based on digital
technologies, and have largely merged with the computer industry in what is
increasingly referred to as the consumerization of information_technology. Some
consumer electronics stores, such as Best_Buy, have also begun selling office
and baby furniture. Consumer_electronics_stores may be "bricks_and_mortar"
physical retail stores, online stores, where the consumer chooses items on a
website and pays online (e.g., Amazon). or a combination of both models (e.g.,
Best Buy has both bricks and mortar stores and an e-commerce website for
ordering its products). The CEA (Consumer_Electronics_Association) estimated
the value of 2015 consumer electronics sales at US$220 billion.[3]

***** History[edit] *****
A radio and TV store in 1961
For its first fifty years the phonograph turntable did not use electronics; the
needle and soundhorn were purely mechanical technologies. However, in the 1920s
radio_broadcasting became the basis of mass_production of radio_receivers. The
vacuum_tubes that had made radios practical were used with record players as
well, to amplify the sound so that it could be played through a loudspeaker.
Television was soon invented, but remained insignificant in the consumer market
until the 1950s.
The first practical transistor, a point-contact_transistor, was invented by
William_Shockley, Walter_Houser_Brattain and John_Bardeen at Bell_Laboratories
in 1947, which led to significant research in the field of solid-state
semiconductors in the early 1950s.[4] By 1959, Fairchild_Semiconductor had
introduced the first planar_transistor from which come the origins of Moore's
law.[5] The MOSFET (metal-oxide-silicon field-effect_transistor), also known as
the MOS transistor, was invented by Mohamed_Atalla and Dawon_Kahng at Bell_Labs
in 1959.[6][7][8][9] The MOS transistor's advantages include high_scalability,
[10] affordability,[11] low power consumption, and high_density, which enabled
Moore's law[12] and revolutionized the electronics industry;[13][14] the MOS
transistor is the most common semiconductor_device in the world.[8][15]
Integrated_circuits (ICs) followed when manufacturers built circuits (usually
for military purposes) on a single substrate using electrical connections
between circuits within the chip itself. The invention and development of the
transistor at Bell Labs, and later developments in semiconductor_technology,
led to far better and cheaper consumer electronics, such as transistor_radios,
televisions, and by the 1980s, affordable video_game consoles and personal
computers that regular middle-class families could buy. As of 2013, billions of
MOS transistors are manufactured for electronic devices every day.[8]
***** Products[edit] *****

Main consumer electronics products include radio_receivers, television_sets,
MP3_players, video_recorders, DVD_players, digital_cameras, camcorders,
personal_computers, video_game_consoles, telephones and mobile_phones.[16]
Increasingly these products have become based on digital technologies, and have
largely merged with the computer industry in what is increasingly referred to
as the consumerization of information_technology such as those invented by
Apple_Inc. and MIT_Media_Lab.
**** Trends[edit] ****
A modern flat panel, HDTV television_set
One overriding characteristic of consumer electronic products is the trend of
ever-falling prices. This is driven by gains in manufacturing efficiency and
automation, lower labor costs as manufacturing has moved to lower-wage
countries, and improvements in semiconductor design.[17] Semiconductor
components benefit from Moore's_law, an observed principle which states that,
for a given price, semiconductor functionality doubles every two years.
While consumer electronics continues in its trend of convergence, combining
elements of many products, consumers face different decisions when purchasing.
There is an ever-increasing need to keep product information updated and
comparable, for the consumer to make an informed choice. Style, price,
specification, and performance are all relevant. There is a gradual shift
towards e-commerce web-storefronts.
Many products include Internet_connectivity using technologies such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, EDGE or Ethernet. Products not traditionally associated with
computer use (such as TVs or Hi-Fi equipment) now provide options to connect to
the Internet or to a computer using a home_network to provide access to digital
content. The desire for high-definition_(HD) content has led the industry to
develop a number of technologies, such as WirelessHD or ITU-T G.hn, which are
optimized for distribution of HD content between consumer electronic devices in
a home.
***** Manufacturing[edit] *****
Main article: Electronics_manufacturing

Most consumer electronics are built in China, due to maintenance cost,
availability of materials, quality, and speed as opposed to other countries
such as the United States.[18] Cities such as Shenzhen have become important
production centres for the industry, attracting many consumer electronics
companies such as Apple_Inc.[19]
**** Electronic component[edit] ****
Main article: Electronic_component
An electronic component is any basic discrete device or physical entity in an
electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields.
Electronic components are mostly industrial products, available in a singular
form and are not to be confused with electrical_elements, which are conceptual
abstractions representing idealized electronic components.
**** Software development[edit] ****
See also: Software_development
Consumer electronics such as personal computers use various types of software.
Embedded software is used within some consumer electronics, such as mobile
phones.[20] This type of software may be embedded within the hardware of
electronic devices.[21] Some consumer electronics include software that is used
on a personal computer in conjunction with electronic devices, such as
camcorders and digital_cameras, and third-party software for such devices also
exists.
**** Standardization[edit] ****
Some consumer electronics adhere to protocols, such as connection_protocols "to
high speed bi-directional signals".[22] In telecommunications, a communications
protocol is a system of digital rules for data exchange within or between
computers.
***** Trade shows[edit] *****
The Internationale_Funkausstellung_Berlin (IFA) trade_show has taken place
Berlin, Germany since its foundation in 1924. The event features new consumer
electronics and speeches by industry pioneers.
The Consumer_Electronics_Show (CES) trade_show has taken place yearly in Las
Vegas, Nevada since its foundation in 1973. The event, which grew from having
100 exhibitors in its inaugural year to more than 3,600 exhibitors in its 2014
edition, features new consumer electronics and speeches by industry pioneers.
[23]
***** IEEE initiatives[edit] *****
Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers (IEEE), the world's largest
professional society, has many initiatives to advance the state of the art of
consumer electronics. IEEE has a dedicated society of thousands of
professionals to promote CE, called the Consumer_Electronics_Society_(CESoc).
[24] IEEE has multiple periodicals and international conferences to promote CE
and encourage collaborative research and development in CE. The flagship
conference of CESoc, called IEEE International Conference on Consumer
Electronics (ICCE), is on its 35th year.

***** Retailing[edit] *****
See also: Consumer_electronics_store
Electronics retailing is a significant part of the retail industry in many
countries. In the United States, dedicated consumer_electronics_stores have
mostly given way to big-box_retailers such as Best_Buy the largest consumer
electronics retailer in the country,[28] although smaller dedicated stores
include Apple_Stores, and specialist stores that serve, for example,
audiophiles and exceptions, such as the single-branch B&H_Photo store in New
York City. Broad-based retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, also sell
consumer electronics in many of their stores.[28] In April 2014, retail e-
commerce sales were the highest in the consumer electronic and computer
categories as well.[29] Some consumer electronics retailers offer extended
warranties on products with programs such as SquareTrade.[30]

The electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics, emerged in
the 20th century and has now become a global industry worth billions of
dollars. Contemporary society uses all manner of electronic devices built in
automated or semi-automated factories operated by the industry.

***** Service and repair[edit] *****
See also: Electronics_technician
Consumer electronic service can refer to the maintenance of said products. When
consumer electronics have malfunctions, they may sometimes be repaired.
In 2013 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the increased popularity in listening to
sound from analog audio devices, such as record_players, as opposed to digital
sound, has sparked a noticeable increase of business for the electronic repair
industry there.[32]
***** Environmental impact[edit] *****
**** Energy consumption[edit] ****
The energy consumption of consumer electronics and their environmental impact,
either from their production processes or the disposal of the devices, is
increasing steadily. EIA estimates that electronic devices and gadgets account
for about 10%√¢¬Ä¬ì15% of the energy use in American homes √¢¬Ä¬ì largely because of
their number; the average house has dozens of electronic devices.[33] The
energy consumption of consumer electronics increases √¢¬Ä¬ì in America and Europe
√¢¬Ä¬ì to about 50% of household consumption, if the term is redefined to include
home_appliances such as refrigerators, dryers, clothes_washers and dishwashers.
**** Standby power[edit] ****
Standby_power √¢¬Ä¬ì used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are
turned off √¢¬Ä¬ì accounts for 5√¢¬Ä¬ì10% of total household energy consumption,
costing $100 annually to the average household in the United States.[34] A
study by United_States_Department_of_Energy's Berkeley_Lab found that a
videocassette recorders (VCRs) consume more electricity during the course of a
year in standby mode than when they are used to record or playback videos.
Similar findings were obtained concerning satellite_boxes, which consume almost
the same amount of energy in "on" and "off" modes.[35]
A 2012 study in the United Kingdom, carried out by the Energy_Saving_Trust,
found that the devices using the most power on standby mode included
televisions, satellite boxes and other video and audio equipment. The study
concluded that UK households could save up to √Ç¬£86 per year by switching
devices off instead of using standby mode.[36] A report from the International
Energy_Agency in 2014 found that $80 billion of power is wasted globally per
year due to inefficiency of electronic devices.[37] Consumers can reduce
unwanted use of standby power by unplugging their devices, using power strips
with switches, or by buying devices that are standardized for better energy
management, particularly Energy_Star marked products.[34]
**** Electronic waste[edit] ****
Electronic_waste: discarded electronic equipment
Electronic_waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Many
consumer electronics may contain toxic minerals and elements,[38] and many
electronic scrap components, such as CRTs, may contain contaminants such as
lead, cadmium, beryllium, mercury, dioxins, or brominated_flame_retardants.
Electronic_waste_recycling may involve significant risk to workers and
communities and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling
operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and
incinerator ashes. However, large amounts of the produced electronic waste from
developed countries is exported, and handled by the informal_sector in
countries like India, despite the fact that exporting electronic waste to them
is illegal. Strong informal sector can be a problem for the safe and clean
recycling.[39]
Reuse and repair
E-waste policy has gone through various incarnations since the 1970s, with
emphases changing as the decades passed. More weight was gradually placed on
the need to dispose of e-waste more carefully due to the toxic materials it may
contain. There has also been recognition that various valuable metals and
plastics from waste electrical equipment can be recycled for other uses. More
recently the desirability of reusing whole appliances has been foregrounded in
the √¢¬Ä¬òpreparation for reuse√¢¬Ä¬ô guidelines. The policy focus is slowly moving
towards a potential shift in attitudes to reuse and repair.
With turnover of small household appliances high and costs relatively low, many
consumers will throw unwanted electric goods in the normal dustbin, meaning
that items of potentially high reuse or recycling value go to landfills. While
larger items such as washing machines are usually collected, it has been
estimated that the 160,000 tonnes of EEE in regular waste collections was worth
√Ç¬£220 million. And 23% of EEE taken to Household Waste Recycling Centres was
immediately resaleable √¢¬Ä¬ì or would be with minor repairs or refurbishment.
This indicates a lack of awareness among consumers as to where and how to
dispose of EEE, and of the potential value of things that are literally going
in the bin.
For reuse and repair of electrical goods to increase substantially in the UK
there are barriers that must be overcome. These include people√¢¬Ä¬ôs mistrust of
used equipment in terms of whether it will be functional, safe, and the stigma
for some of owning second-hand goods. But the benefits of reuse could allow
lower income households access to previously unaffordable technology whilst
helping the environment at the same time.<Cole, C., Cooper, T. and
Gnanapragasam, A., 2016. Extending product lifetimes through WEEE reuse and
repair: opportunities and challenges in the UK. In: Electronics Goes Green
2016+ Conference, Berlin, Germany, 7√¢¬Ä¬ì9 September 2016>
***** Health impact[edit] *****
Desktop monitors and laptops produce major physical health concerns for humans
when bodies are forced into positions that are unhealthy and uncomfortable in
order to see the screen better. From this, neck and back pains and problems
increase, commonly referred to as repetitive_strain_injuries. Using electronics
before going to bed makes it difficult for people to fall asleep, which has a
negative effect on human health. Sleeping less prevents people from performing
to their full potential physically and mentally and can also √¢¬Ä¬úincrease rates
of obesity and diabetes,√¢¬Ä¬ù which are √¢¬Ä¬úlong-term health consequences√¢¬Ä¬ù.[40]
Obesity and diabetes are more commonly seen in students and in youth because
they tend to be the ones using electronics the most. √¢¬Ä¬úPeople who frequently
use their thumbs to type text messages on cell phones can develop a painful
affliction called De_Quervain_syndrome that affects their tendons on their
hands. The best known disease in this category is called carpal_tunnel
syndrome, which results from pressure on the median nerve in the wrist√¢¬Ä¬ù.[40]
