For experimental methods and computational details, see Determination_of
equilibrium_constants.
The equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction is the value of its reaction
quotient at chemical_equilibrium, a state approached by a dynamic chemical
system after sufficient time has elapsed at which its composition has no
measurable tendency towards further change. For a given set of reaction
conditions, the equilibrium constant is independent of the initial analytical
concentrations of the reactant and product species in the mixture. Thus, given
the initial composition of a system, known equilibrium constant values can be
used to determine the composition_of_the_system_at_equilibrium. However,
reaction parameters like temperature, solvent, and ionic_strength may all
influence the value of the equilibrium constant.
A knowledge of equilibrium constants is essential for the understanding of many
chemical systems, as well as biochemical processes such as oxygen transport by
hemoglobin in blood and acid-base_homeostasis in the human body.
Stability_constants, formation constants, binding_constants, association
constants and dissociation_constants are all types of equilibrium constants.

a thermodynamic equilibrium constant, denoted by      K  &#x2296;
{\displaystyle K^{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle K^{\ominus }}], is defined to be
the value of the reaction_quotient Qt when forward and reverse reactions occur
at the same rate. At chemical_equilibrium, the chemical composition of the
mixture does not change with time and the Gibbs_free_energy change     &#x0394;
G   {\displaystyle \Delta G}  [\Delta G] for the reaction is zero. If the
composition of a mixture at equilibrium is changed by addition of some reagent,
a new equilibrium position will be reached, given enough time. An equilibrium
constant is related to the composition of the mixture at equilibrium by [1][2]

where {X} denotes the thermodynamic_activity of reagent X at equilibrium, [X]
the corresponding concentration, and Î³ the corresponding activity_coefficient.
If it can be assumed that the quotient of activity coefficients,     &#x0393;
{\displaystyle \Gamma }  [\Gamma ], is constant over a range of experimental
conditions, such as pH, then an equilibrium constant can be derived as a
quotient of concentrations.

      [\mathrm {R} ]^{\rho }[\mathrm {S} ]^{\sigma }...}{[\mathrm {A} ]^{\alpha

An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs_free_energy change of
reaction     &#x0394;  G  &#x2296;     {\displaystyle \Delta G^{\ominus }}
[\Delta G^{\ominus }] by
         &#x0394;  G  &#x2296;   = &#x2212; R T ln &#x2061;  K  &#x2296;   ,
      {\displaystyle \Delta G^{\ominus }=-RT\ln K^{\ominus },}  [{\displaystyle
      \Delta G^{\ominus }=-RT\ln K^{\ominus },}]
where R is the universal_gas_constant, T is the absolute_temperature (in
kelvins), and ln is a natural_logarithm. This expression implies that      K
&#x2296;     {\displaystyle K^{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle K^{\ominus }}] must
be a pure number and cannot have a dimension, since logarithms can only be
taken of pure numbers.      K  c     {\displaystyle K_{c}}  [K_c] must also be
a pure number. On the other hand, the reaction_quotient at equilibrium
            [  R   ]  &#x03C1;   [  S   ]  &#x03C3;   . . .   [  A   ]

      [\mathrm {R} ]^{\rho }[\mathrm {S} ]^{\sigma }...}{[\mathrm {A} ]^{\alpha
      }[\mathrm {B} ]^{\beta }...}}(eq)}]
does have the dimension of concentration raised to some power (see
#Dimensionality, below). Such reaction quotients are often referred to, in the
biochemical literature, as equilibrium constants.
For an equilibrium mixture of gases, an equilibrium constant can be defined in
terms of partial_pressure or fugacity.
An equilibrium constant is related to the forward and backward rate_constants,
kf and kr of the reactions involved in reaching equilibrium:
          K  &#x2296;   =    k  f    k  r     .   {\displaystyle K^{\ominus }=
      {\frac {k_{\text{f}}}{k_{\text{r}}}}.}  [{\displaystyle K^{\ominus }=
      {\frac {k_{\text{f}}}{k_{\text{r}}}}.}]
***** Types of equilibrium constants[edit] *****
**** Cumulative and stepwise formation constants[edit] ****
A cumulative or overall constant, given the symbol Î², is the constant for the
formation of a complex from reagents. For example, the cumulative constant for
the formation of ML2 is given by
      M + 2 L â ML2;       [ML2] = Î²12[M][L]2
The stepwise constant, K, for the formation of the same complex from ML and L
is given by
      ML + L â ML2;       [ML2] = K[ML][L] = KÎ²11[M][L]2
It follows that
      Î²12 = KÎ²11
A cumulative constant can always be expressed as the product of stepwise
constants. There is no agreed notation for stepwise constants, though a symbol
such as KL
ML is sometimes found in the literature. It is best always to define each
stability constant by reference to an equilibrium expression.
*** Competition method[edit] ***
A particular use of a stepwise constant is in the determination of stability
constant values outside the normal range for a given method. For example, EDTA
complexes of many metals are outside the range for the potentiometric method.
The stability constants for those complexes were determined by competition with
a weaker ligand.
      ML + Lâ² â MLâ² + L           [   M L  &#x2032;  ] = K    [  M L  ]

      {L} ][\mathrm {L} ']}{[\mathrm {L} ]}}=K\beta _{\mathrm {ML} }[\mathrm
      {M} ][\mathrm {L} '];\quad \beta _{\mathrm {ML} '}=K\beta _{\mathrm {ML}
      }}  [{\displaystyle [\mathrm {ML} ']=K{\frac {[\mathrm {ML} ][\mathrm {L}
      ']}{[\mathrm {L} ]}}=K{\frac {\beta _{\mathrm {ML} }[\mathrm {M} ]

      [\mathrm {M} ][\mathrm {L} '];\quad \beta _{\mathrm {ML} '}=K\beta _
      {\mathrm {ML} }}]
The formation constant of [Pd(CN)4]2â was determined by the competition
method.
**** Association and dissociation constants[edit] ****
In organic chemistry and biochemistry it is customary to use pKa values for
acid dissociation equilibria.
          p   K   a    = &#x2212; log &#x2061;  K   d i s s    = log &#x2061;
      (   1  K   d i s s      )     {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} K_{\mathrm {a}
      }=-\log K_{\mathrm {diss} }=\log \left({\frac {1}{K_{\mathrm {diss}
      }}}\right)\,}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {p} K_{\mathrm {a} }=-\log K_
      {\mathrm {diss} }=\log \left({\frac {1}{K_{\mathrm {diss} }}}\right)\,}]
where log denotes a logarithm to base 10 or common_logarithm, and Kdiss is a
stepwise acid_dissociation_constant. For bases, the base_association_constant,
pKb is used. For any given acid or base the two constants are related by pKa +
pKb = pKw, so pKa can always be used in calculations.
On the other hand, stability constants for metal_complexes, and binding
constants for hostâguest complexes are generally expressed as association
constants. When considering equilibria such as
      M + HL â ML + H
it is customary to use association constants for both ML and HL. Also, in
generalized computer programs dealing with equilibrium constants it is general
practice to use cumulative constants rather than stepwise constants and to omit
ionic charges from equilibrium expressions. For example, if NTA,
nitrilotriacetic_acid, N(CH2CO2H)3 is designated as H3L and forms complexes ML
and MHL with a metal ion M, the following expressions would apply for the
dissociation constants.
               H  3      L       &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;

      H  2      L       &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;     &#x21C0;

The cumulative association constants can be expressed as

Note how the subscripts define the stoichiometry of the equilibrium product.
**** Micro-constants[edit] ****
When two or more sites in an asymmetrical molecule may be involved in an
equilibrium reaction there are more than one possible equilibrium constants.
For example, the molecule L-DOPA has two non-equivalent hydroxyl groups which
may be deprotonated. Denoting L-DOPA as LH2, the following diagram shows all
the species that may be formed (X = CH2CH(NH2)CO2H):
      [Micro_constants.png]
The first protonation constants are
      [L1H] = k11[L][H], [L2H] = k12[L][H]
The concentration of LHâ is the sum of the concentrations of the two micro-
species. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the reaction, the macro-
constant, is the sum of the micro-constants.
      K1 = k11 + k12
In the same way,
      K2 = k21 + k22
Lastly, the cumulative constant is
      Î²2 = K1K2 = k11k21 = k12k22
Thus, although there are seven micro-and macro-constants, only three of them
are mutually independent. Moreover, the isomerization constant, Ki, is equal to
the ratio of the microconstants.
      Ki = k11/k12
In L-DOPA the isomerization constant is 0.9, so the micro-species L1H and L2H
have almost equal concentrations at all pH values.
In general a macro-constant is equal to the sum of all the micro-constants and
the occupancy of each site is proportional to the micro-constant. The site of
protonation can be very important, for example, for biological activity.
Micro-constants cannot be determined individually by the usual_methods, which
give macro-constants. Methods which have been used to determine micro-constants
include:
    * blocking one of the sites, for example by methylation of a hydroxyl
      group, to determine one of the micro-constants
    * using a spectroscopic technique, such as infrared_spectroscopy, where the
      different micro-species give different signals.
    * applying mathematical procedures to 13C NMR data.[3][4]
**** pH considerations (BrÃ¸nsted constants)[edit] ****
pH is defined in terms of the activity of the hydrogen ion
      pH = âlog10 {H+}
In the approximation of ideal behaviour, activity is replaced by concentration.
pH is measured by means of a glass electrode, a mixed equilibrium constant,
also known as a BrÃ¸nsted constant, may result.
      HL â L + H;            p  K = &#x2212; log &#x2061;  (    [  L  ] {  H
      }   [  H L  ]    )    {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} K=-\log \left({\frac {
      [\mathrm {L} ]\{\mathrm {H} \}}{[\mathrm {HL} ]}}\right)}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} K=-\log \left({\frac {[\mathrm {L} ]\{\mathrm
      {H} \}}{[\mathrm {HL} ]}}\right)}]
It all depends on whether the electrode is calibrated by reference to solutions
of known activity or known concentration. In the latter case the equilibrium
constant would be a concentration quotient. If the electrode is calibrated in
terms of known hydrogen ion concentrations it would be better to write p[H]
rather than pH, but this suggestion is not generally adopted.
**** Hydrolysis constants[edit] ****
In aqueous solution the concentration of the hydroxide ion is related to the
concentration of the hydrogen ion by
             K    W       =   [ H ]   [ OH ]     {\displaystyle {\ce {{\mathit
      {K}}_{W}=[H][OH]}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {{\mathit {K}}_{W}=[H][OH]}}}]
           [ OH ]   =     K    W        [ H ]   &#x2212; 1      {\displaystyle
      {\ce {[OH]={\mathit {K}}_{W}[H]^{-1}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {[OH]=
      {\mathit {K}}_{W}[H]^{-1}}}}]
The first step in metal ion hydrolysis[5] can be expressed in two different

It follows that Î²* = KKW. Hydrolysis constants are usually reported in the Î²*
form and therefore often have values much less than 1. For example, if log K =
4 and log KW = â14, log Î²* = 4 + (â14) = â10 so that Î²* = 10â10. In
general when the hydrolysis product contains n hydroxide groups log Î²* = log K
+ n log KW
**** Conditional constants[edit] ****
Conditional constants, also known as apparent constants, are concentration
quotients which are not true equilibrium constants but can be derived from
them.[6] A very common instance is where pH is fixed at a particular value. For
example, in the case of iron(III) interacting with EDTA, a conditional constant
could be defined by
          K   c o n d    =    [   Total Fe bound to EDTA   ]   [   Total Fe not
      bound to EDTA   ] &#x00D7; [   Total EDTA not bound to Fe   ]
      {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {cond} }={\frac {[{\mbox{Total Fe bound to
      EDTA}}]}{[{\mbox{Total Fe not bound to EDTA}}]\times [{\mbox{Total EDTA
      not bound to Fe}}]}}}  [{\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {cond} }={\frac {[
      {\mbox{Total Fe bound to EDTA}}]}{[{\mbox{Total Fe not bound to
      EDTA}}]\times [{\mbox{Total EDTA not bound to Fe}}]}}}]
This conditional constant will vary with pH. It has a maximum at a certain pH.
That is the pH where the ligand sequesters the metal most effectively.
In biochemistry equilibrium constants are often measured at a pH fixed by means
of a buffer_solution. Such constants are, by definition, conditional and
different values may be obtained when using different buffers.
**** Gas-phase equilibria[edit] ****
For equilibria in a gas_phase, fugacity, f, is used in place of activity.
However, fugacity has the dimension of pressure, so it must be divided by a
standard pressure, usually 1 bar, in order to produce a dimensionless quantity,
f/po. An equilibrium constant is expressed in terms of the dimensionless
quantity. For example, for the equilibrium 2NO2 â N2O4,
            f    N  2    O  4       p  &#x2296;     = K   (    f   N  O  2
      p  &#x2296;     )   2     {\displaystyle {\frac {f_{\mathrm {N_{2}O_{4}}
      }}{p^{\ominus }}}=K\left({\frac {f_{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }}{p^{\ominus
      }}}\right)^{2}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {f_{\mathrm {N_{2}O_{4}} }}{p^
      {\ominus }}}=K\left({\frac {f_{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }}{p^{\ominus }}}\right)^
      {2}}]
Fugacity is related to partial_pressure, p, by a dimensionless fugacity
coefficient Ï: f = Ïp. Thus, for the example,
         K =     &#x03D5;    N  2    O  4       p    N  2    O  4       /    p
      &#x2296;       (   &#x03D5;   N  O  2       p   N  O  2       /    p
      &#x2296;     )   2       {\displaystyle K={\frac {\phi _{\mathrm {N_{2}O_
      {4}} }p_{\mathrm {N_{2}O_{4}} }/{p^{\ominus }}}{\left(\phi _{\mathrm {NO_
      {2}} }p_{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }/{p^{\ominus }}\right)^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle
      K={\frac {\phi _{\mathrm {N_{2}O_{4}} }p_{\mathrm {N_{2}O_{4}} }/{p^
      {\ominus }}}{\left(\phi _{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }p_{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }/{p^
      {\ominus }}\right)^{2}}}}]
Usually the standard pressure is omitted from such expressions. Expressions for
equilibrium constants in the gas phase then resemble the expression for
solution equilibria with fugacity coefficient in place of activity coefficient
and partial pressure in place of concentration.
         K =     &#x03D5;    N  2    O  4       p    N  2    O  4
      (   &#x03D5;   N  O  2       p   N  O  2       )   2       {\displaystyle
      K={\frac {\phi _{\mathrm {N_{2}O_{4}} }p_{\mathrm {N_{2}O_{4}} }}{\left
      (\phi _{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }p_{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }\right)^{2}}}}  [
      {\displaystyle K={\frac {\phi _{\mathrm {N_{2}O_{4}} }p_{\mathrm {N_{2}O_
      {4}} }}{\left(\phi _{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }p_{\mathrm {NO_{2}} }\right)^
      {2}}}}]
***** Thermodynamic basis for equilibrium constant expressions[edit] *****
Thermodynamic_equilibrium is characterized by the free energy for the whole
(closed) system being a minimum. For systems at constant temperature and
pressure the Gibbs_free_energy is minimum.[7] The slope of the reaction free
energy with respect to the reaction_coordinate, Î¾, is zero when the free
energy is at its minimum value.
           (    &#x2202; G   &#x2202; &#x03BE;    )   T , P   = 0
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial G}{\partial \xi }}\right)_{T,P}=0}
      [{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial G}{\partial \xi }}\right)_
      {T,P}=0}]
The free energy change, Î´Gr, can be expressed as a weighted sum of chemical
potentials, the partial molar free energies of the species in equilibrium. The
potential, Î¼i, of the ith species in a chemical reaction is the partial
derivative of the free energy with respect to the number of moles of that
species, Ni
          &#x03BC;  i   =   (    &#x2202; G   &#x2202;  N  i      )   T , P

      {i}}}\right)_{T,P}}  [\mu_i=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial N_i}\right)_
      {T,P}]
A general chemical equilibrium can be written as

where nj are the stoichiometric_coefficients of the reactants in the
equilibrium equation, and mj are the coefficients of the products. At

i is the standard chemical potential of the species, R is the gas_constant and
T is the temperature. Setting the sum for the reactants j to be equal to the

**** Equivalence of thermodynamic and kinetic expressions for equilibrium
constants[edit] ****
At equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the backward
reaction rate. A simple reaction, such as ester_hydrolysis
          AB +  H  2      O       &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;
      &#x21C0;       AH + B  ( OH )     {\displaystyle {\ce {AB + H2O <=> AH +
      B(OH)}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {AB + H2O <=> AH + B(OH)}}}]
has reaction rates given by expressions
          forward rate  =  k  f     [ AB ]   [  H  2      O ]
      {\displaystyle {\text{forward rate}}=k_{f}{\ce {[AB][H2O]}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\text{forward rate}}=k_{f}{\ce {[AB][H2O]}}}]
          backward rate  =  k  b     [ AH ]   [ B  ( OH )  ]     {\displaystyle
      {\text{backward rate}}=k_{b}{\ce {[AH][B(OH)]}}}  [{\displaystyle {\text
      {backward rate}}=k_{b}{\ce {[AH][B(OH)]}}}]
According to Guldberg and Waage, equilibrium is attained when the forward and
backward reaction rates are equal to each other. In these circumstances, an
equilibrium constant is defined to be equal to the ratio of the forward and
backward reaction rate constants.
         K =    k  f    k  b     =     [ AH ]   [ B  ( OH )  ]     [ AB ]
      [  H  2      O ]       {\displaystyle K={\frac {k_{f}}{k_{b}}}={\frac {
      {\ce {[AH][B(OH)]}}}{{\ce {[AB][H2O]}}}}}  [{\displaystyle K={\frac {k_
      {f}}{k_{b}}}={\frac {{\ce {[AH][B(OH)]}}}{{\ce {[AB][H2O]}}}}}]
For convenience the concentration of water may be taken to be constant,
resulting in the simpler expression
          K  c   =     [ AH ]   [ B  ( OH )  ]     [ AB ]       {\displaystyle
      K^{c}={\frac {{\ce {[AH][B(OH)]}}}{{\ce {[AB]}}}}}  [{\displaystyle K^
      {c}={\frac {{\ce {[AH][B(OH)]}}}{{\ce {[AB]}}}}}]
This particular concentration quotient,      K  c     {\displaystyle K^{c}}
[K^c], has the dimension of concentration, but the thermodynamic equilibrium
constant, K, is always dimensionless.
***** Unknown activity coefficient values[edit] *****
Variation of log Kc of acetic acid with ionic strength
It is very rare for activity coefficient values to have been determined
experimentally for a system at equilibrium. There are three options for dealing
with the situation where activity coefficient values are not known from
experimental measurements.
   1. Use calculated activity coefficients, together with concentrations of
      reactants. For equilibria in solution estimates of the activity
      coefficients of charged species can be obtained using DebyeâHÃ¼ckel
      theory, an extended version, or SIT_theory. For uncharged species, the
      activity coefficient Î³0 mostly follows a "salting-out" model: log10 Î³0
      = bI where I stands for ionic_strength.[8]
   2. Assume that the activity coefficients are all equal to 1. This is
      acceptable when all concentrations are very low.
   3. For equilibria in solution use a medium of high ionic strength. In effect
      this redefines the standard_state as referring to the medium. Activity
      coefficients in the standard state are, by definition, equal to 1. The
      value of an equilibrium constant determined in this manner is dependent
      on the ionic strength. When published constants refer to an ionic
      strength other than the one required for a particular application, they
      may be adjusted by means of specific ion theory (SIT) and other theories.
      [9]
***** Dimensionality[edit] *****
An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs_free_energy change,
&#x0394;  G  &#x2296;     {\displaystyle \Delta G^{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle
\Delta G^{\ominus }}], for the reaction by the expression
         &#x0394;  G  &#x2296;   = &#x2212; R T ln &#x2061; K   {\displaystyle
      \Delta G^{\ominus }=-RT\ln K}  [{\displaystyle \Delta G^{\ominus }=-RT\ln
      K}]
Therefore K, must be a number from which a logarithm can be derived. In the
case of a simple equilibrium
          A + B       &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;     &#x21C0;
      AB    {\displaystyle {\ce {A + B <=> AB}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {A + B
      <=> AB}}}]
the thermodynamic equilibrium constant is defined in terms of the activities,
{AB}, {A} and {B}, of the species in equilibrium with each other.
         K =    { A B }   { A } { B }      {\displaystyle K={\frac {\{AB\}}{\
      {A\}\{B\}}}}  [{\displaystyle K={\frac {\{AB\}}{\{A\}\{B\}}}}]
Now, each activity term can be expressed as a product of a concentration
[ X ]   {\displaystyle [X]}  [[X]] and a corresponding activity_coefficient,
&#x03B3; ( X )   {\displaystyle \gamma (X)}  [{\displaystyle \gamma (X)}].
Therefore,
         K =    [ A B ]   [ A ] [ B ]    &#x00D7;    &#x03B3; ( A B )
      &#x03B3; ( A ) &#x03B3; ( B )    =    [ A B ]   [ A ] [ B ]    &#x00D7;
      &#x0393;   {\displaystyle K={\frac {[AB]}{[A][B]}}\times {\frac {\gamma
      (AB)}{\gamma (A)\gamma (B)}}={\frac {[AB]}{[A][B]}}\times \Gamma }  [
      {\displaystyle K={\frac {[AB]}{[A][B]}}\times {\frac {\gamma (AB)}{\gamma
      (A)\gamma (B)}}={\frac {[AB]}{[A][B]}}\times \Gamma }]
When the quotient of activity coefficients,     &#x0393;   {\displaystyle
\Gamma }  [\Gamma ] is set equal to 1
         K =    [ A B ]   [ A ] [ B ]      {\displaystyle K={\frac {[AB]}{[A]
      [B]}}}  [{\displaystyle K={\frac {[AB]}{[A][B]}}}]
K then appears to have the dimension of 1/concentration. This is what usually
happens in practice when an equilibrium constant is calculated as a quotient of
concentration values. The assumption underlying this practice is that the
quotient of activities is constant under the conditions in which the
equilibrium constant value is determined. There conditions are usually achieved
by keeping the reaction temperature constant and by using a medium of
relatively high ionic_strength as the solvent. It is not unusual, particularly
in texts relating to biochemical equilibria, to see a value quoted with a
dimension. The justification for this practice is that the concentration scale
used may be either mol dmâ3 or mmol dmâ3, so that the concentration unit
has to be stated in order to avoid there being any ambiguity.
Note. When the concentration values are measured on the mole_fraction scale all
concentrations and activity coefficients are dimensionless quantities.
In general equilibria between two reagents can be expressed as
             p   A  +   q   B       &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;
      &#x21C0;        A   p        B   q          {\displaystyle {\ce {{
      {\mathit {p}}A}+{\mathit {q}}B<=>A_{\mathit {p}}B_{\mathit {q}}}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\ce {{{\mathit {p}}A}+{\mathit {q}}B<=>A_{\mathit {p}}B_
      {\mathit {q}}}}}]
in which case the equilibrium constant is defined, in terms of numerical
concentration values, as
         K =    [   A   p     B   q   ]   [  A   ]  p   [  B   ]  q
      {\displaystyle K={\frac {[{\ce {A}}_{p}{\ce {B}}_{q}]}{[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[
      {\ce {B}}]^{q}}}}  [{\displaystyle K={\frac {[{\ce {A}}_{p}{\ce {B}}_
      {q}]}{[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce {B}}]^{q}}}}]
The apparent dimension of this K value is concentration1âpâq; this may be
written as M(1âpâq) or mM(1âpâq), where the symbol M signifies a molar
concentration (1M = 1 mol dmâ3). The apparent dimension of a dissociation
constant is the reciprocal of the apparent dimension of the corresponding
association_constant, and vice versa.
When discussing the thermodynamics of chemical equilibria it is necessary to
take dimensionality into account. There are two possible approaches.
   1. Set the dimension of Γ to be the reciprocal of the dimension of the
      concentration quotient. This is almost universal practice in the field of
      stability constant determinations. The "equilibrium constant"       K
      &#x0393;     {\displaystyle {\frac {K}{\Gamma }}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {K}{\Gamma }}}], is dimensionless. It will be a function of the ionic
      strength of the medium used for the determination. Setting the numerical
      value of Γ to be 1 is equivalent to re-defining the standard_states.
   2. Replace each concentration term     [ X ]   {\displaystyle [X]}  [[X]] by
      the dimensionless quotient        [ X ]   [  X  0   ]      {\displaystyle
      {\frac {[X]}{[X^{0}]}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {[X]}{[X^{0}]}}}], where
      [  X  0   ]   {\displaystyle [X^{0}]}  [{\displaystyle [X^{0}]}] is the
      concentration of reagent X in its standard state. By definition the
      numerical value of     &#x03B3; (  X  0   )   {\displaystyle \gamma (X^
      {0})}  [{\displaystyle \gamma (X^{0})}] is 1, so Γ also has a numerical
      value of 1.
In both approaches the numerical value of the stability constant is unchanged.
The first is more useful for practical purposes; in fact, the unit of the
concentration quotient is often attached to a published stability constant
value in the biochemical literature. The second approach is consistent with the
standard exposition of DebyeâHÃ¼ckel_theory, where     &#x03B3; ( A B )
{\displaystyle \gamma (AB)}  [{\displaystyle \gamma (AB)}], etc. are taken to
be pure numbers.
***** Water as both reactant and solvent[edit] *****
For reactions in aqueous solution, such as an acid dissociation reaction
      AH + H2O â Aâ + H3O+
the concentration of water may be taken as being constant and the formation of
the hydronium_ion is implicit.
      AH â Aâ + H+
Water concentration is omitted from expressions defining equilibrium constants,
except when solutions are very concentrated.
         K =    [ A ] [ H ]   [ A H ]      {\displaystyle K={\frac {[A][H]}{

H^{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle \Delta H^{\ominus }}], for a reaction have been
determined experimentally, the standard_entropy_change for the reaction is
easily derived. Since     &#x0394; G = &#x0394; H &#x2212; T &#x0394; S
{\displaystyle \Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S}  [{\displaystyle \Delta G=\Delta H-
T\Delta S}] and     &#x0394; G = &#x2212; R T ln &#x2061; K   {\displaystyle
\Delta G=-RT\ln K}  [{\displaystyle \Delta G=-RT\ln K}]
         &#x0394;  S  &#x2296;   =    &#x0394;  H  &#x2296;   + R T ln &#x2061;
      K  T     {\displaystyle \Delta S^{\ominus }={\frac {\Delta H^{\ominus
      }+RT\ln K}{T}}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta S^{\ominus }={\frac {\Delta H^
      {\ominus }+RT\ln K}{T}}}]
To a first approximation the standard enthalpy change is independent of
temperature. Using this approximation, definite_integration of the van_'t_Hoff
equation
         &#x0394;  H  &#x2296;   = &#x2212; R    d ln &#x2061; K   d ( 1  /  T
      )    &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \Delta H^{\ominus }=-R{\frac {d\ln K}{d(1/
      T)}}\ }  [{\displaystyle \Delta H^{\ominus }=-R{\frac {d\ln K}{d(1/T)}}\
      }]
gives[10]
         ln &#x2061;  K  2   = ln &#x2061;  K  1   &#x2212;    &#x0394;  H
      &#x2296;    R    (    1  T  2     &#x2212;   1  T  1      )
      {\displaystyle \ln K_{2}=\ln K_{1}-{\frac {\Delta H^{\ominus }}{R}}\left(
      {\frac {1}{T_{2}}}-{\frac {1}{T_{1}}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle \ln K_
      {2}=\ln K_{1}-{\frac {\Delta H^{\ominus }}{R}}\left({\frac {1}{T_{2}}}-
      {\frac {1}{T_{1}}}\right)}]
This equation can be used to calculate the value of log K at a temperature, T2,
knowing the value at temperature T1.
The van 't Hoff equation also shows that, for an exothermic reaction
(    &#x0394; H < 0   {\displaystyle \Delta H<0}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
H<0}]), when temperature increases K decreases and when temperature decreases K
increases, in accordance with Le_Chatelier's_principle. The reverse applies
when the reaction is endothermic.
When K has been determined at more than two temperatures, a straight line
fitting procedure may be applied to a plot of     ln &#x2061; K
{\displaystyle \ln K}  [{\displaystyle \ln K}] against     1  /  T
{\displaystyle 1/T}  [1/T] to obtain a value for     &#x0394;  H  &#x2296;
{\displaystyle \Delta H^{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle \Delta H^{\ominus }}].
Error_propagation theory can be used to show that, with this procedure, the
error on the calculated     &#x0394;  H  &#x2296;     {\displaystyle \Delta H^
{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle \Delta H^{\ominus }}] value is much greater than
the error on individual log K values. Consequently, K needs to be determined to
high precision when using this method.For example, with a silver ion-selective
electrode each log K value was determined with a precision of ca. 0.001 and the
method was applied successfully.[11]
Standard thermodynamic arguments can be used to show that, more generally,
enthalpy will change with temperature.
           (    &#x2202; H   &#x2202; T    )   p   =  C  p     {\displaystyle
      \left({\frac {\partial H}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}=C_{p}}  [\left(\frac
      {\partial H}{\partial T} \right)_p=C_p]
where Cp is the heat_capacity at constant pressure.
**** A more complex formulation[edit] ****
The calculation of K at a particular temperature from a known K at another
given temperature can be approached as follows if standard thermodynamic
properties are available. The effect of temperature on equilibrium constant is
equivalent to the effect of temperature on Gibbs energy because:
         ln &#x2061; K =    &#x2212;  &#x0394;   r     G  &#x2296;     R T
      {\displaystyle \ln K={{-\Delta _{\mathrm {r} }G^{\ominus }} \over {RT}}}
      [\ln K = {{-\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\ominus} \over {RT}}]
where ÎrGo is the reaction standard Gibbs energy, which is the sum of the
standard Gibbs energies of the reaction products minus the sum of standard
Gibbs energies of reactants.
Here, the term "standard" denotes the ideal behaviour (i.e., an infinite
dilution) and a hypothetical standard concentration (typically 1 mol/kg). It
does not imply any particular temperature or pressure because, although
contrary to IUPAC recommendation, it is more convenient when describing aqueous
systems over wide temperature and pressure ranges.[12]
The standard Gibbs energy (for each species or for the entire reaction) can be
represented (from the basic definitions) as:
          G   T  2     &#x2296;   =  G   T  1     &#x2296;   &#x2212;  S   T  1
      &#x2296;   (  T  2   &#x2212;  T  1   ) &#x2212;  T  2    &#x222B;   T  1
      T  2         C  p   &#x2296;     T     d T +  &#x222B;   T  1      T  2
      C  p   &#x2296;    d T   {\displaystyle G_{T_{2}}^{\ominus }=G_{T_{1}}^
      {\ominus }-S_{T_{1}}^{\ominus }(T_{2}-T_{1})-T_{2}\int _{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}{
      {C_{p}^{\ominus }} \over {T}}\,dT+\int _{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}C_{p}^{\ominus
      }\,dT}  [{\displaystyle G_{T_{2}}^{\ominus }=G_{T_{1}}^{\ominus }-S_{T_
      {1}}^{\ominus }(T_{2}-T_{1})-T_{2}\int _{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}{{C_{p}^{\ominus
      }} \over {T}}\,dT+\int _{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}C_{p}^{\ominus }\,dT}]
In the above equation, the effect of temperature on Gibbs energy (and thus on
the equilibrium constant) is ascribed entirely to heat capacity. To evaluate
the integrals in this equation, the form of the dependence of heat capacity on
temperature needs to be known.
If the standard molar heat capacity Co
p can be approximated by some analytic function of temperature (e.g. the
Shomate_equation), then the integrals involved in calculating other parameters
may be solved to yield analytic expressions for them. For example, using
approximations of the following forms:[13]
    * For pure substances (solids, gas, liquid):
          C  p   &#x2296;   &#x2248; A + B T + C  T  &#x2212; 2
      {\displaystyle C_{p}^{\ominus }\approx A+BT+CT^{-2}}  [{\displaystyle C_
      {p}^{\ominus }\approx A+BT+CT^{-2}}]
    * For ionic species at T < 200 Â°C:
          C  p   &#x2296;   &#x2248; ( 4.186 a + b     S &#x02D8;      T  1
      &#x2296;   )    (  T  2   &#x2212;  T  1   )   ln &#x2061;  (    T  2
      T  1     )       {\displaystyle C_{p}^{\ominus }\approx (4.186a+b{\breve
      {S}}_{T_{1}}^{\ominus }){{(T_{2}-T_{1})} \over {\ln \left({\frac {T_{2}}
      {T_{1}}}\right)}}}  [{\displaystyle C_{p}^{\ominus }\approx (4.186a+b
      {\breve {S}}_{T_{1}}^{\ominus }){{(T_{2}-T_{1})} \over {\ln \left({\frac
      {T_{2}}{T_{1}}}\right)}}}]
then the integrals can be evaluated and the following final form is obtained:
          G   T  2     &#x2296;   &#x2248;  G   T  1     &#x2296;   + (  C  p
      &#x2296;   &#x2212;  S   T  1     &#x2296;   ) (  T  2   &#x2212;  T  1
      ) &#x2212;  T  2   ln &#x2061;  (    T  2    T  1     )   C  p   &#x2296;
      {\displaystyle G_{T_{2}}^{\ominus }\approx G_{T_{1}}^{\ominus }+(C_{p}^
      {\ominus }-S_{T_{1}}^{\ominus })(T_{2}-T_{1})-T_{2}\ln \left({\frac {T_
      {2}}{T_{1}}}\right)C_{p}^{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle G_{T_{2}}^{\ominus
      }\approx G_{T_{1}}^{\ominus }+(C_{p}^{\ominus }-S_{T_{1}}^{\ominus })(T_
      {2}-T_{1})-T_{2}\ln \left({\frac {T_{2}}{T_{1}}}\right)C_{p}^{\ominus }}]
The constants A, B, C, a, b and the absolute entropy, SÌ  o
298 K, required for evaluation of Co
p(T), as well as the values of G298 K and S298 K for many species are tabulated
in the literature.
***** Pressure dependence[edit] *****
The pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant is usually weak in the
range of pressures normally encountered in industry, and therefore, it is
usually neglected in practice. This is true for condensed reactant/products
(i.e., when reactants and products are solids or liquid) as well as gaseous
ones.
For a gaseous-reaction example, one may consider the well-studied reaction of
hydrogen with nitrogen to produce ammonia:
      N2 + 3 H2 â 2 NH3
If the pressure is increased by the addition of an inert gas, then neither the
composition at equilibrium nor the equilibrium constant are appreciably
affected (because the partial pressures remain constant, assuming an ideal-gas
behaviour of all gases involved). However, the composition at equilibrium will
depend appreciably on pressure when:
    * the pressure is changed by compression or expansion of the gaseous
      reacting system, and
    * the reaction results in the change of the number of moles of gas in the
      system.
In the example reaction above, the number of moles changes from 4 to 2, and an
increase of pressure by system compression will result in appreciably more
ammonia in the equilibrium mixture. In the general case of a gaseous reaction:
      Î± A + Î² B â Ï S + Ï T
the change of mixture composition with pressure can be quantified using:
          K  p   =       p   S      &#x03C3;      p   T      &#x03C4;        p
      A      &#x03B1;      p   B      &#x03B2;      =       X   S      &#x03C3;
      X   T      &#x03C4;        X   A      &#x03B1;      X   B      &#x03B2;
      P  &#x03C3; + &#x03C4; &#x2212; &#x03B1; &#x2212; &#x03B2;   =  K  X    P
      &#x03C3; + &#x03C4; &#x2212; &#x03B1; &#x2212; &#x03B2;
      {\displaystyle K_{p}={\frac {{p_{\mathrm {S} }}^{\sigma }{p_{\mathrm {T}
      }}^{\tau }}{{p_{\mathrm {A} }}^{\alpha }{p_{\mathrm {B} }}^{\beta }}}=
      {\frac {{X_{\mathrm {S} }}^{\sigma }{X_{\mathrm {T} }}^{\tau }}{{X_
      {\mathrm {A} }}^{\alpha }{X_{\mathrm {B} }}^{\beta }}}P^{\sigma +\tau -
      \alpha -\beta }=K_{X}P^{\sigma +\tau -\alpha -\beta }}  [{\displaystyle
      K_{p}={\frac {{p_{\mathrm {S} }}^{\sigma }{p_{\mathrm {T} }}^{\tau }}{{p_
      {\mathrm {A} }}^{\alpha }{p_{\mathrm {B} }}^{\beta }}}={\frac {{X_
      {\mathrm {S} }}^{\sigma }{X_{\mathrm {T} }}^{\tau }}{{X_{\mathrm {A} }}^
      {\alpha }{X_{\mathrm {B} }}^{\beta }}}P^{\sigma +\tau -\alpha -\beta }=K_
      {X}P^{\sigma +\tau -\alpha -\beta }}]
where p denote the partial pressures and X the mole fractions of the
components, P is the total system pressure, Kp is the equilibrium constant
expressed in terms of partial pressures and KX is the equilibrium constant
expressed in terms of mole fractions.
The above change in composition is in accordance with Le_Chatelier's_principle
and does not involve any change of the equilibrium constant with the total
system pressure. Indeed, for ideal-gas reactions Kp is independent of pressure.
[14]
Pressure dependence of the water ionization constant at 25 Â°C. In general,
ionization in aqueous solutions tends to increase with increasing pressure.
In a condensed phase, the pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant is
associated with the reaction volume.[15] For reaction:
      Î± A + Î² B â Ï S + Ï T
the reaction volume is:
         &#x0394;    V &#x00AF;    = &#x03C3;     V &#x00AF;      S    +
      &#x03C4;     V &#x00AF;      T    &#x2212; &#x03B1;     V &#x00AF;      A
      &#x2212; &#x03B2;     V &#x00AF;      B      {\displaystyle \Delta {\bar
      {V}}=\sigma {\bar {V}}_{\mathrm {S} }+\tau {\bar {V}}_{\mathrm {T} }-
      \alpha {\bar {V}}_{\mathrm {A} }-\beta {\bar {V}}_{\mathrm {B} }}  [
      {\displaystyle \Delta {\bar {V}}=\sigma {\bar {V}}_{\mathrm {S} }+\tau
      {\bar {V}}_{\mathrm {T} }-\alpha {\bar {V}}_{\mathrm {A} }-\beta {\bar
      {V}}_{\mathrm {B} }}]
where VÌ denotes a partial_molar_volume of a reactant or a product.
For the above reaction, one can expect the change of the reaction equilibrium
constant (based either on mole-fraction or molal-concentration scale) with
pressure at constant temperature to be:
           (    &#x2202; ln &#x2061;  K  X     &#x2202; P    )   T   =
      &#x2212; &#x0394;    V &#x00AF;      R T    .   {\displaystyle \left(
      {\frac {\partial \ln K_{X}}{\partial P}}\right)_{T}={\frac {-\Delta {\bar
      {V}}}{RT}}.}  [ \left(\frac{\partial \ln K_X}{\partial P} \right)_T =
      \frac{-\Delta \bar{V}} {RT}. ]
The matter is complicated as partial molar volume is itself dependent on
pressure.
***** Effect of isotopic substitution[edit] *****
Isotopic substitution can lead to changes in the values of equilibrium
constants, especially if hydrogen is replaced by deuterium (or tritium).[16]
This equilibrium isotope effect is analogous to the kinetic_isotope_effect on
rate constants, and is primarily due to the change in zero-point_vibrational
energy of HâX bonds due to the change in mass upon isotopic substitution.[16]
The zero-point energy is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass
of the vibrating hydrogen atom, and will therefore be smaller for a DâX bond
that for an HâX bond.
An example is a hydrogen_atom_abstraction reaction R' + HâR â R'âH + R
with equilibrium constant KH, where R' and R are organic radicals such that R'
forms a stronger bond to hydrogen than does R. The decrease in zero-point
energy due to deuterium substitution will then be more important for R'âH
than for RâH, and R'âD will be stabilized more than RâD, so that the
equilibrium constant KD for R' + DâR â R'âD + R is greater than KH. This
is summarized in the rule the heavier atom favors the stronger bond.[16]
Similar effects occur in solution for acid_dissociation_constants (Ka) which
describe the transfer of H+ or D+ from a weak aqueous acid to a solvent
molecule: HA + H2O = H3O+ + Aâ or DA + D2O â D3O+ + Aâ. The deuterated
acid is studied in heavy water, since if it were dissolved in ordinary water
the deuterium would rapidly exchange with hydrogen in the solvent.[16]
The product species H3O+ (or D3O+) is a stronger acid than the solute acid, so
that it dissociates more easily and its HâO (or DâO) bond is weaker than
the HâA (or DâA) bond of the solute acid. The decrease in zero-point energy
due to isotopic substitution is therefore less important in D3O+ than in DA so
that KD < KH, and the deuterated acid in D2O is weaker than the non-deuterated
acid in H2O. In many cases the difference of logarithmic constants pKD â pKH
is about 0.6,[16] so that the pD corresponding to 50% dissociation of the
deuterated acid is about 0.6 units higher than the pH for 50% disssociation of
the non-deuterated acid.
