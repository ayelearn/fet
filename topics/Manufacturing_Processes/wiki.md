Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labour and
machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term
may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high_tech, but is
most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw_materials are
transformed into finished_goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be
sold to other manufacturers for the production of other, more complex products,
such as aircraft, household_appliances, furniture, sports_equipment or
automobiles, or sold to wholesalers, who in turn sell them to retailers, who
then sell them to end_users and consumers.
Manufacturing_engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which
raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process
begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the
product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing
processes to become the required part.
Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the
production and integration of a product's components. Some industries, such as
semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead.
The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial
design. Examples of major manufacturers in North_America include General_Motors
Corporation, General_Electric, Procter_&_Gamble, General_Dynamics, Boeing,
Pfizer, and Precision_Castparts. Examples in Europe include Volkswagen_Group,
Siemens, FCA and Michelin. Examples in Asia include Toyota, Yamaha, Panasonic,
LG, Samsung and Tata_Motors.

    * In its earliest form, manufacturing was usually carried out by a single
      skilled artisan with assistants. Training was by apprenticeship. In much
      of the pre-industrial world, the guild system protected the privileges
      and trade_secrets of urban artisans.
    * Before the Industrial_Revolution, most manufacturing occurred in rural
      areas, where household-based manufacturing served as a supplemental
      subsistence strategy to agriculture (and continues to do so in places).
      Entrepreneurs organized a number of manufacturing households into a
      single enterprise through the putting-out_system.
    * Toll manufacturing is an arrangement whereby a first firm with
      specialized equipment processes raw materials or semi-finished goods for
      a second firm.

***** Industrial policy[edit] *****
Main article: Industrial_policy
**** Economics of manufacturing[edit] ****
Emerging_technologies have provided some new growth in advanced manufacturing
employment opportunities in the Manufacturing_Belt in the United_States.
Manufacturing provides important material support for national infrastructure
and for national_defense.
On the other hand, most manufacturing may involve significant social and
environmental costs. The clean-up costs of hazardous_waste, for example, may
outweigh the benefits of a product that creates it. Hazardous materials may
expose workers to health risks. These costs are now well known and there is
effort to address them by improving efficiency, reducing waste, using
industrial_symbiosis, and eliminating harmful chemicals.
The negative costs of manufacturing can also be addressed legally. Developed
countries regulate manufacturing activity with labor_laws and environmental
laws. Across the globe, manufacturers can be subject to regulations and
pollution taxes to offset the environmental_costs_of_manufacturing_activities.
Labor_unions and craft_guilds have played a historic role in the negotiation of
worker rights and wages. Environment laws and labor protections that are
available in developed nations may not be available in the third_world. Tort
law and product_liability impose additional costs on manufacturing. These are
significant dynamics in the ongoing process, occurring over the last few
decades, of manufacture-based industries relocating operations to "developing-
world" economies where the costs of production are significantly lower than in
"developed-world" economies.
**** Safety[edit] ****
Manufacturing has unique health and safety challenges and has been recognized
by the National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health (NIOSH) as a
priority industry sector in the National_Occupational_Research_Agenda (NORA) to
identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and
safety issues.[1][2]
**** Manufacturing and investment[edit] ****
Capacity utilization in manufacturing in the FRG and in the USA
Surveys and analyses of trends and issues in manufacturing and investment
around the world focus on such things as:
    * The nature and sources of the considerable variations that occur cross-
      nationally in levels of manufacturing and wider industrial-economic
      growth;
    * Competitiveness; and
    * Attractiveness to foreign direct investors.
In addition to general overviews, researchers have examined the features and
factors affecting particular key aspects of manufacturing development. They
have compared production and investment in a range of Western and non-Western
countries and presented case studies of growth and performance in important
individual industries and market-economic sectors.[3][4]
On June 26, 2009, Jeff_Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, called for the
United_States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the
workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much in some areas and
can no longer rely on the financial sector and consumer spending to drive
demand.[5] Further, while U.S. manufacturing performs well compared to the rest
of the U.S. economy, research shows that it performs poorly compared to
manufacturing in other high-wage countries.[6] A total of 3.2 million â one
in six U.S. manufacturing jobs â have disappeared between 2000 and 2007.[7]
In the UK, EEF_the_manufacturers_organization has led calls for the UK economy
to be rebalanced to rely less on financial services and has actively promoted
the manufacturing agenda.
