In physics, Bragg's law, or WulffâBragg's condition, a special case of Laue
diffraction, gives the angles for coherent and incoherent scattering from a
crystal lattice. When X-rays are incident on an atom, they make the electronic
cloud move, as does any electromagnetic_wave. The movement of these charges re-
radiates waves with the same frequency, blurred slightly due to a variety of
effects; this phenomenon is known as Rayleigh_scattering (or elastic
scattering). The scattered waves can themselves be scattered but this secondary
scattering is assumed to be negligible.
A similar process occurs upon scattering neutron waves from the nuclei or by a
coherent spin interaction with an unpaired electron. These re-emitted wave
fields interfere with each other either constructively or destructively
(overlapping waves either add up together to produce stronger peaks or are
subtracted from each other to some degree), producing a diffraction pattern on
a detector or film. The resulting wave interference pattern is the basis of
diffraction analysis. This analysis is called Bragg diffraction.

***** History[edit] *****
X-rays interact with the atoms in a crystal.
Bragg diffraction (also referred to as the Bragg formulation of X-ray
diffraction) was first proposed by Lawrence_Bragg and his father William_Henry
Bragg in 1913[1] in response to their discovery that crystalline solids
produced surprising patterns of reflected X-rays (in contrast to that of, say,
a liquid). They found that these crystals, at certain specific wavelengths and
incident angles, produced intense peaks of reflected radiation. The concept of
Bragg diffraction applies equally to neutron_diffraction and electron
diffraction processes.[2] Both neutron and X-ray wavelengths are comparable
with inter-atomic distances (~ 150 pm) and thus are an excellent probe for this
length_scale.
According to the 2Î¸ deviation, the phase shift causes constructive (left
figure) or destructive (right figure) interferences.
Lawrence Bragg explained this result by modeling the crystal as a set of
discrete parallel planes separated by a constant parameter d. It was proposed
that the incident X-ray radiation would produce a Bragg peak if their
reflections off the various planes interfered constructively. The interference
is constructive when the phase shift is a multiple of 2π; this condition can be
expressed by Bragg's law (see Bragg condition section below) and was first
presented by Lawrence Bragg on 11 November 1912 to the Cambridge_Philosophical
Society.[3][4] Although simple, Bragg's law confirmed the existence of real
particles at the atomic scale, as well as providing a powerful new tool for
studying crystals in the form of X-ray and neutron diffraction. Lawrence Bragg
and his father, William Henry Bragg, were awarded the Nobel_Prize in physics in
1915 for their work in determining crystal structures beginning with NaCl, ZnS,
and diamond. They are the only father-son team to jointly win. Lawrence Bragg
was 25 years old, making him the youngest physics Nobel laureate.
***** Bragg condition[edit] *****
Bragg diffraction. Two beams with identical wavelength and phase approach a
crystalline solid and are scattered off two different atoms within it. The
lower beam traverses an extra length of 2dsinÎ¸. Constructive interference
occurs when this length is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength of
the radiation.
Bragg diffraction occurs when radiation, with a wavelength comparable to atomic
spacings, is scattered in a specular fashion by the atoms of a crystalline
system, and undergoes constructive interference. For a crystalline solid, the
waves are scattered from lattice planes separated by the interplanar distance
d. When the scattered waves interfere constructively, they remain in phase
since the difference between the path lengths of the two waves is equal to an
integer multiple of the wavelength. The path difference between two waves
undergoing interference is given by 2dsin Î¸, where Î¸ is the scattering angle
(see figure on the right). The effect of the constructive or destructive
interference intensifies because of the cumulative effect of reflection in
successive crystallographic_planes of the crystalline lattice (as described by
Miller_notation). This leads to Bragg's law, which describes the condition on
Î¸ for the constructive interference to be at its strongest:[5]
         2 d sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; = n &#x03BB;  ,   {\displaystyle 2d\sin
      \theta =n\lambda \,,}  [2d\sin \theta =n\lambda \,,]
where n is a positive integer and Î» is the wavelength of the incident wave.
Note that moving particles, including electrons, protons and neutrons, have an
associated wavelength called de_Broglie_wavelength. A diffraction pattern is
obtained by measuring the intensity of scattered waves as a function of
scattering angle. Very strong intensities known as Bragg peaks are obtained in
the diffraction pattern at the points where the scattering angles satisfy Bragg
condition. As mentioned in the introduction, this condition is a special case
of the more general Laue_equations, and the Laue equations can be shown to
reduce to the Bragg condition under additional assumptions.
The phenomena of Bragg diffraction by a crystal lattice shares similar
characteristics with that of thin_film_interference, which has an identical
condition in the limit where the refractive indices of the surrounding medium
(e.g. air) and the interfering medium (e.g. oil) are equal.
***** Heuristic derivation[edit] *****
Suppose that a single monochromatic wave (of any type) is incident on aligned
planes of lattice points, with separation     d   {\displaystyle d}  [d], at
angle     &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle \theta }  [\theta ]. Points A and C are on
one plane, and B is on the plane below. Points ABCC' form a quadrilateral.
                               [Bragg's_law.svg]
There will be a path difference between the ray that gets reflected along AC'
and the ray that gets transmitted along AB, then reflected along BC. This path
difference is
         ( A B + B C ) &#x2212;  (  A  C &#x2032;   )   .   {\displaystyle
      (AB+BC)-\left(AC'\right)\,.}  [{\displaystyle (AB+BC)-\left
      (AC'\right)\,.}]
The two separate waves will arrive at a point with the same phase, and hence
undergo constructive_interference, if and only if this path difference is equal
to any integer value of the wavelength, i.e.
         ( A B + B C ) &#x2212;  (  A  C &#x2032;   )  = n &#x03BB;  ,
      {\displaystyle (AB+BC)-\left(AC'\right)=n\lambda \,,}  [{\displaystyle
      (AB+BC)-\left(AC'\right)=n\lambda \,,}]
where the same definition of     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] and     &#x03BB;
{\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ] apply as above.
Therefore,
         A B = B C =   d  sin &#x2061; &#x03B8;     &#xA0;and&#xA0;  A C =    2
      d   tan &#x2061; &#x03B8;     ,   {\displaystyle AB=BC={\frac {d}{\sin
      \theta }}{\text{ and }}AC={\frac {2d}{\tan \theta }}\,,}  [AB=BC={\frac
      {d}{\sin \theta }}{\text{ and }}AC={\frac  {2d}{\tan \theta }}\,,]
from which it follows that
         A  C &#x2032;  = A C &#x22C5; cos &#x2061; &#x03B8; =    2 d   tan
      &#x2061; &#x03B8;    cos &#x2061; &#x03B8; =  (     2 d   sin &#x2061;
      &#x03B8;    cos &#x2061; &#x03B8;  )  cos &#x2061; &#x03B8; =    2 d
      sin &#x2061; &#x03B8;     cos  2   &#x2061; &#x03B8;  .   {\displaystyle
      AC'=AC\cdot \cos \theta ={\frac {2d}{\tan \theta }}\cos \theta =\left(
      {\frac {2d}{\sin \theta }}\cos \theta \right)\cos \theta ={\frac {2d}
      {\sin \theta }}\cos ^{2}\theta \,.}  [AC'=AC\cdot \cos \theta ={\frac
      {2d}{\tan \theta }}\cos \theta =\left({\frac  {2d}{\sin \theta }}\cos
      \theta \right)\cos \theta ={\frac  {2d}{\sin \theta }}\cos ^{2}\theta
      \,.]
Putting everything together,
         n &#x03BB; =    2 d   sin &#x2061; &#x03B8;    &#x2212;    2 d   sin
      &#x2061; &#x03B8;     cos  2   &#x2061; &#x03B8; =    2 d   sin &#x2061;
      &#x03B8;     (  1 &#x2212;  cos  2   &#x2061; &#x03B8;  )  =    2 d   sin
      &#x2061; &#x03B8;     sin  2   &#x2061; &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle
      n\lambda ={\frac {2d}{\sin \theta }}-{\frac {2d}{\sin \theta }}\cos ^
      {2}\theta ={\frac {2d}{\sin \theta }}\left(1-\cos ^{2}\theta \right)=
      {\frac {2d}{\sin \theta }}\sin ^{2}\theta }  [{\displaystyle n\lambda =
      {\frac {2d}{\sin \theta }}-{\frac {2d}{\sin \theta }}\cos ^{2}\theta =
      {\frac {2d}{\sin \theta }}\left(1-\cos ^{2}\theta \right)={\frac {2d}
      {\sin \theta }}\sin ^{2}\theta }]
which simplifies to     n &#x03BB; = 2 d sin &#x2061; &#x03B8;  ,
{\displaystyle n\lambda =2d\sin \theta \,,}  [n\lambda =2d\sin \theta \,,]
which is Bragg's law.
If only two planes of atoms were diffracting, as shown in the pictures, then
the transition from constructive to destructive interference would be gradual
as a function of angle, with gentle maxima at the Bragg angles. However, since
many atomic planes are interfering in real materials, very sharp peaks
surrounded by mostly destructive interference result.[6]
A rigorous derivation from the more general Laue equations is available (see
page: Laue_equations).
***** Bragg scattering of visible light by colloids[edit] *****
A colloidal_crystal is a highly ordered array of particles that forms over a
long range (from a few millimeters to one centimeter in length); colloidal
crystals have appearance and properties roughly analogous to their atomic or
molecular counterparts.[7] It has been known for many years that, due to
repulsive Coulombic interactions, electrically_charged macromolecules in an
aqueous environment can exhibit long-range crystal-like correlations, with
interparticle separation distances often being considerably greater than the
individual particle diameter. Periodic arrays of spherical particles give rise
to interstitial_voids (the spaces between the particles), which act as a
natural diffraction_grating for visible_light_waves, when the interstitial
spacing is of the same order_of_magnitude as the incident lightwave.[8][9][10]
In these cases in nature, brilliant iridescence (or play of colours) is
attributed to the diffraction and constructive_interference of visible
lightwaves according to Bragg's law, in a matter analogous to the scattering of
X-rays in crystalline solid. The effects occur at visible wavelengths because
the separation parameter d is much larger than for true crystals.
***** Volume Bragg gratings[edit] *****
Main article: Volume_hologram
Volume Bragg gratings (VBG) or volume_holographic_gratings (VHG) consist of a
volume where there is a periodic change in the refractive_index. Depending on
the orientation of the modulation of the refractive index, VBG can be used
either to transmit or reflect a small bandwidth of wavelengths.[11] Bragg's law
(adapted for volume hologram) dictates which wavelength will be diffracted:[12]
         2 n &#x039B; sin &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; + &#x03C6; ) =  &#x03BB;  B    ,
      {\displaystyle 2n\Lambda \sin(\theta +\varphi )=\lambda _{B}\,,}  [
      {\displaystyle 2n\Lambda \sin(\theta +\varphi )=\lambda _{B}\,,}]
where n is a positive integer, Î»B the diffracted wavelength, Î the step of
the grating, Î¸ the angle between the incident beam and the normal (N) of the
entrance surface and Ï the angle between the normal and the grating vector
(KG). Radiation that does not match Bragg's law will pass through the VBG
undiffracted. The output wavelength can be tuned over a few hundred nanometers
by changing the incident angle (Î¸). VBG are being used to produce widely
tunable_laser source or perform global hyperspectral_imagery (see Photon_etc.).
***** Selection rules and practical crystallography[edit] *****
Bragg's law, as stated above, can be used to obtain the lattice spacing of a
particular cubic_system through the following relation:
         d =   a   h  2   +  k  2   +  &#x2113;  2       ,   {\displaystyle d=
      {\frac {a}{\sqrt {h^{2}+k^{2}+\ell ^{2}}}}\,,}  [{\displaystyle d={\frac
      {a}{\sqrt {h^{2}+k^{2}+\ell ^{2}}}}\,,}]
where     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] is the lattice spacing of the cubic
crystal, and h, k, and â are the Miller_indices of the Bragg plane. Combining
this relation with Bragg's law:
           (   &#x03BB;  2 a    )   2   =   (   &#x03BB;  2 d    )   2     1
      h  2   +  k  2   +  &#x2113;  2        {\displaystyle \left({\frac
      {\lambda }{2a}}\right)^{2}=\left({\frac {\lambda }{2d}}\right)^{2}{\frac
      {1}{h^{2}+k^{2}+\ell ^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\lambda }
      {2a}}\right)^{2}=\left({\frac {\lambda }{2d}}\right)^{2}{\frac {1}{h^
      {2}+k^{2}+\ell ^{2}}}}]

These selection rules can be used for any crystal with the given crystal
structure. KCl has a face-centered cubic Bravais_lattice. However, the K+ and
the Clâ ion have the same number of electrons and are quite close in size, so
that the diffraction pattern becomes essentially the same as for a simple cubic
structure with half the lattice parameter. Selection rules for other structures
can be referenced elsewhere, or derived. Lattice spacing for the other crystal
systems can be found here.
