Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events.[1] A random
sequence of events, symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an
intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition
unpredictable, but in many cases the frequency of different outcomes over a
large number of events (or "trials") is predictable. For example, when throwing
two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7
will occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is a measure of
uncertainty of an outcome, rather than haphazardness, and applies to concepts
of chance, probability, and information_entropy.
According to Ramsey_theory ideal randomness is impossible especially for large
structures, for instance professor Theodore_Motzkin pointed out that "while
disorder is more probable in general, complete disorder is impossible".[2]
Misunderstanding of this leads to numerous conspiracy_theories[3].
The fields of mathematics, probability, and statistics use formal definitions
of randomness. In statistics, a random_variable is an assignment of a numerical
value to each possible outcome of an event_space. This association facilitates
the identification and the calculation of probabilities of the events. Random
variables can appear in random_sequences. A random_process is a sequence of
random variables whose outcomes do not follow a deterministic pattern, but
follow an evolution described by probability_distributions. These and other
constructs are extremely useful in probability_theory and the various
applications_of_randomness.
Randomness is most often used in statistics to signify well-defined statistical
properties. Monte_Carlo_methods, which rely on random input (such as from
random_number_generators or pseudorandom_number_generators), are important
techniques in science, as, for instance, in computational_science.[4] By
analogy, quasi-Monte_Carlo_methods use quasirandom_number_generators.
Random selection, when narrowly associated with a simple_random_sample, is a
method of selecting items (often called units) from a population where the
probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion of those items in the
population. For example, with a bowl containing just 10 red marbles and 90 blue
marbles, a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with
probability 1/10. Note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10
marbles from this bowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue. In
situations where a population consists of items that are distinguishable, a
random selection mechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be
chosen. That is, if the selection process is such that each member of a
population, of say research subjects, has the same probability of being chosen
then we can say the selection process is random.

***** History *****
Main article: History_of_randomness
Ancient fresco of dice players in Pompei.
In ancient history, the concepts of chance and randomness were intertwined with
that of fate. Many ancient peoples threw dice to determine fate, and this later
evolved into games of chance. Most ancient cultures used various methods of
divination to attempt to circumvent randomness and fate.[5][6]
The Chinese of 3000 years ago were perhaps the earliest people to formalize
odds and chance. The Greek philosophers discussed randomness at length, but
only in non-quantitative forms. It was only in the 16th century that Italian
mathematicians began to formalize the odds associated with various games of
chance. The invention of the calculus had a positive impact on the formal study
of randomness. In the 1888 edition of his book The Logic of Chance John_Venn
wrote a chapter on The conception of randomness that included his view of the
randomness of the digits of the number pi by using them to construct a random
walk in two dimensions.[7]
The early part of the 20th century saw a rapid growth in the formal analysis of
randomness, as various approaches to the mathematical foundations of
probability were introduced. In the mid- to late-20th century, ideas of
algorithmic_information_theory introduced new dimensions to the field via the
concept of algorithmic_randomness.
Although randomness had often been viewed as an obstacle and a nuisance for
many centuries, in the 20th century computer scientists began to realize that
the deliberate introduction of randomness into computations can be an effective
tool for designing better algorithms. In some cases such randomized_algorithms
outperform the best deterministic methods.
***** In science *****
Many scientific fields are concerned with randomness:
    * Algorithmic_probability
    * Chaos_theory
    * Cryptography
    * Game_theory
    * Information_theory
    * Pattern_recognition
    * Probability_theory
    * Quantum_mechanics
    * Statistical_mechanics
    * Statistics
**** In the physical sciences ****
In the 19th century, scientists used the idea of random motions of molecules in
the development of statistical_mechanics to explain phenomena in thermodynamics
and the_properties_of_gases.
According to several standard interpretations of quantum_mechanics, microscopic
phenomena are objectively random.[8] That is, in an experiment that controls
all causally relevant parameters, some aspects of the outcome still vary
randomly. For example, if a single unstable atom is placed in a controlled
environment, it cannot be predicted how long it will take for the atom to
decayâonly the probability of decay in a given time.[9] Thus, quantum
mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments but only the
probabilities. Hidden_variable_theories reject the view that nature contains
irreducible randomness: such theories posit that in the processes that appear
random, properties with a certain statistical distribution are at work behind
the scenes, determining the outcome in each case.
**** In biology ****
The modern_evolutionary_synthesis ascribes the observed diversity of life to
random genetic mutations followed by natural_selection. The latter retains some
random mutations in the gene_pool due to the systematically improved chance for
survival and reproduction that those mutated genes confer on individuals who
possess them.
Several authors also claim that evolution and sometimes development require a
specific form of randomness, namely the introduction of qualitatively new
behaviors. Instead of the choice of one possibility among several pre-given
ones, this randomness corresponds to the formation of new possibilities.[10]
[11]
The characteristics of an organism arise to some extent deterministically
(e.g., under the influence of genes and the environment) and to some extent
randomly. For example, the density of freckles that appear on a person's skin
is controlled by genes and exposure to light; whereas the exact location of
individual freckles seems random.[12]
As far as behavior is concerned, randomness is important if an animal is to
behave in a way that is unpredictable to others. For instance, insects in
flight tend to move about with random changes in direction, making it difficult
for pursuing predators to predict their trajectories.
**** In mathematics ****
The mathematical theory of probability arose from attempts to formulate
mathematical descriptions of chance events, originally in the context of
gambling, but later in connection with physics. Statistics is used to infer the
underlying probability_distribution of a collection of empirical observations.
For the purposes of simulation, it is necessary to have a large supply of
random_numbers or means to generate them on demand.
Algorithmic_information_theory studies, among other topics, what constitutes a
random_sequence. The central idea is that a string of bits is random if and
only if it is shorter than any computer program that can produce that string
(Kolmogorov_randomness)âthis means that random strings are those that cannot
be compressed. Pioneers of this field include Andrey_Kolmogorov and his student
Per_Martin-LÃ¶f, Ray_Solomonoff, and Gregory_Chaitin. For the notion of
infinite sequence, one normally uses Per_Martin-LÃ¶f's definition. That is, an
infinite sequence is random if and only if it withstands all recursively
enumerable null sets. The other notions of random sequences include (but not
limited to): recursive randomness and Schnorr randomness which are based on
recursively computable martingales. It was shown by Yongge_Wang that these
randomness notions are generally different.[13]
Randomness occurs in numbers such as log_(2) and pi. The decimal digits of pi
constitute an infinite sequence and "never repeat in a cyclical fashion."
Numbers like pi are also considered likely to be normal, which means their
digits are random in a certain statistical sense.
     Pi certainly seems to behave this way. In the first six billion
     decimal places of pi, each of the digits from 0 through 9 shows up
     about six hundred million times. Yet such results, conceivably
     accidental, do not prove normality even in base 10, much less
     normality in other number bases.[14]
**** In statistics ****
Main article: Statistical_randomness
In statistics, randomness is commonly used to create simple_random_samples.
This lets surveys of completely random groups of people provide realistic data.
Common methods of doing this include drawing names out of a hat or using a
random digit chart. A random digit chart is simply a large table of random
digits.
**** In information science ****
In information science, irrelevant or meaningless data is considered noise.
Noise consists of a large number of transient disturbances with a statistically
randomized time distribution.
In communication_theory, randomness in a signal is called "noise" and is
opposed to that component of its variation that is causally attributable to the
source, the signal.
In terms of the development of random networks, for communication randomness
rests on the two simple assumptions of Paul_ErdÅs and AlfrÃ©d_RÃ©nyi who said
that there were a fixed number of nodes and this number remained fixed for the
life of the network, and that all nodes were equal and linked randomly to each
other.[clarification_needed][15]
**** In finance ****
The random_walk_hypothesis considers that asset prices in an organized market
evolve at random, in the sense that the expected value of their change is zero
but the actual value may turn out to be positive or negative. More generally,
asset prices are influenced by a variety of unpredictable events in the general
economic environment.
***** In politics *****
Random selection can be an official method to resolve tied elections in some
jurisdictions.[16] Its use in politics is very old, as office holders in
Ancient_Athens were chosen by lot, there being no voting.
***** Randomness and religion *****
Randomness can be seen as conflicting with the deterministic ideas of some
religions, such as those where the universe is created by an omniscient deity
who is aware of all past and future events. If the universe is regarded to have
a purpose, then randomness can be seen as impossible. This is one of the
rationales for religious opposition to evolution, which states that non-random
selection is applied to the results of random genetic variation.
Hindu and Buddhist philosophies state that any event is the result of previous
events, as reflected in the concept of karma, and as such there is no such
thing as a random event or a first event.[citation_needed]
In some religious contexts, procedures that are commonly perceived as
randomizers are used for divination. Cleromancy uses the casting of bones or
dice to reveal what is seen as the will of the gods.
***** Applications *****
Main article: Applications_of_randomness
In most of its mathematical, political, social and religious uses, randomness
is used for its innate "fairness" and lack of bias.
Politics: Athenian_democracy was based on the concept of isonomia (equality of
political rights) and used complex allotment machines to ensure that the
positions on the ruling committees that ran Athens were fairly allocated.
Allotment is now restricted to selecting jurors in Anglo-Saxon legal systems
and in situations where "fairness" is approximated by randomization, such as
selecting jurors and military draft lotteries.
Games: Random numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling, and
many randomizing devices, such as dice, shuffling_playing_cards, and roulette
wheels, were first developed for use in gambling. The ability to produce random
numbers fairly is vital to electronic gambling, and, as such, the methods used
to create them are usually regulated by government Gaming_Control_Boards.
Random drawings are also used to determine lottery winners. Throughout history,
randomness has been used for games of chance and to select out individuals for
an unwanted task in a fair way (see drawing_straws).
Sports: Some sports, including American_football, use coin_tosses to randomly
select starting conditions for games or seed tied teams for postseason_play.
The National_Basketball_Association uses a weighted lottery to order teams in
its draft.
Mathematics: Random numbers are also employed where their use is mathematically
important, such as sampling for opinion_polls and for statistical sampling in
quality_control systems. Computational solutions for some types of problems use
random numbers extensively, such as in the Monte_Carlo_method and in genetic
algorithms.
Medicine: Random allocation of a clinical intervention is used to reduce bias
in controlled trials (e.g., randomized_controlled_trials).
Religion: Although not intended to be random, various forms of divination such
as cleromancy see what appears to be a random event as a means for a divine
being to communicate their will. (See also Free_will and Determinism).
***** Generation *****
Main article: Random_number_generation
The ball in a roulette can be used as a source of apparent randomness, because
its behavior is very sensitive to the initial conditions.
It is generally accepted that there exist three mechanisms responsible for
(apparently) random behavior in systems:
   1. Randomness coming from the environment (for example, Brownian_motion, but
      also hardware_random_number_generators)
   2. Randomness coming from the initial conditions. This aspect is studied by
      chaos_theory and is observed in systems whose behavior is very sensitive
      to small variations in initial conditions (such as pachinko machines and
      dice).
   3. Randomness intrinsically generated by the system. This is also called
      pseudorandomness and is the kind used in pseudo-random_number_generators.
      There are many algorithms (based on arithmetics or cellular_automaton) to
      generate pseudorandom numbers. The behavior of the system can be
      determined by knowing the seed_state and the algorithm used. These
      methods are often quicker than getting "true" randomness from the
      environment.
The many applications_of_randomness have led to many different methods for
generating random data. These methods may vary as to how unpredictable or
statistically_random they are, and how quickly they can generate random
numbers.
Before the advent of computational random_number_generators, generating large
amounts of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot
of work. Results would sometimes be collected and distributed as random_number
tables.
***** Measures and tests *****
Main article: Randomness_tests
There are many practical measures of randomness for a binary sequence. These
include measures based on frequency, discrete_transforms, and complexity, or a
mixture of these. These include tests by Kak, Phillips, Yuen, Hopkins, Beth and
Dai, Mund, and Marsaglia and Zaman.[17]
Quantum Non-Locality has been used to certify the presence of genuine
randomness in a given string of numbers.[18]
***** Misconceptions and logical fallacies *****
Main article: Gambler's_fallacy
Popular perceptions of randomness are frequently mistaken, based on fallacious
reasoning or intuitions.
**** A number is "due" ****
See also: Coupon_collector's_problem
This argument is, "In a random selection of numbers, since all numbers
eventually appear, those that have not come up yet are 'due', and thus more
likely to come up soon." This logic is only correct if applied to a system
where numbers that come up are removed from the system, such as when playing
cards are drawn and not returned to the deck. In this case, once a jack is
removed from the deck, the next draw is less likely to be a jack and more
likely to be some other card. However, if the jack is returned to the deck, and
the deck is thoroughly reshuffled, a jack is as likely to be drawn as any other
card. The same applies in any other process where objects are selected
independently, and none are removed after each event, such as the roll of a
die, a coin toss, or most lottery number selection schemes. Truly random
processes such as these do not have memory, making it impossible for past
outcomes to affect future outcomes. In fact, there is no finite number of
trials that can guarantee a success.
**** A number is "cursed" or "blessed" ****
See also: Benford's_law
In a random sequence of numbers, a number may be said to be cursed because it
has come up less often in the past, and so it is thought that it will occur
less often in the future. A number may be assumed to be blessed because it has
occurred more often than others in the past, and so it is thought likely to
come up more often in the future. This logic is valid only if the randomisation
is biased, for example with a loaded die. If the die is fair, then previous
rolls give no indication of future events.
In nature, events rarely occur with perfectly equal frequency, so observing
outcomes to determine which events are more probable makes sense. It is
fallacious to apply this logic to systems designed to make all outcomes equally
likely, such as shuffled cards, dice, and roulette wheels.
**** Odds are never dynamic ****
In the beginning of a scenario, one might calculate the probability of a
certain event. The fact is, as soon as one gains more information about that
situation, they may need to re-calculate the probability.
When the host reveals one door that contains a goat, this is new information.
Say we are told that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them
is a girl, and are told yes, what is the probability that the other child is
also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the
probability that the other child is female is Â½ (50%). But by building a
probability_space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the
probability is actually only â (33%). This is because the possibility space
illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl,
and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once we are told that one of
the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy
scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to
have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only
â of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl.[19] Using a
probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or
to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy
or_girl_paradox.
This technique provides insights in other situations such as the Monty_Hall
problem, a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three
doors, and two goats are hidden as booby_prizes behind the others. Once the
contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to
reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only two doors left
(one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to
either keep their decision, or switch and select the other door. Intuitively,
one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal
probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no
difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new
information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other
door.[19]
