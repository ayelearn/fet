Gauze is a thin, translucent fabric with a loose open weave. In technical terms
"gauze" is a weave structure in which the weft yarns are arranged in pairs and
are crossed before and after each warp yarn keeping the weft firmly in place.
[1] This weave structure is used to add stability to fabric, which is important
when using fine yarns loosely spaced. However, this weave structure can be used
with any weight of yarn, and can be seen in some rustic textiles made from
coarse hand-spun plant fiber yarns.

***** Etymology and history[edit] *****
Gauze was traditionally woven in Palestine and the English word is said to
derive from the place_name for Gaza[2] (Arabic: ØºØ²Ø©‎ ghazza), a center of
weaving in the region.[3] Despite a prohibition on trade with non-Christians
from religious authorities in medieval Europe, a fine type of silk known as
gazzatum was imported from Gaza as early as the 13th century.[4] Though members
of religious orders in Europe were forbidden to wear it, the fabric won a place
for itself and emerged into modern life as gauze.[4]
According to the French government's online etymology dictionary, the English
form of the word derived from the French gaze, whose ultimate origin is
uncertain, but is often attributed to the Arabic and Persian word qazz meaning
"raw silk", which itself was obtained from the name of Gaza.[5] The same source
says the existence of "an ancient textile industry in Gaza is not assured," and
it is not known how the word entered into widespread use in European languages,
with examples of first usages cited being the medieval Latin forms garza in
Bologna in 1250 and gazzatum in Budapest in 1279.[5]
***** Uses and types[edit] *****
Gauze was originally made of silk and was used for clothing. It is now used for
many different things, including gauze_sponges for medical purposes. When used
as a medical_dressing, gauze is generally made of cotton. It is especially
useful for dressing wounds where other fabrics might stick to the burn or
laceration. Many modern medical gauzes are covered with a plastic porous film
such as Telfa or a polyblend which prevents direct contact and further
minimizes wound adhesion. Also, it can be impregnated with a thick, creamy
mixture of zinc_oxide and calamine to promote healing, as in Unna's_boot. Gauze
is also used during procedures involving accidental_tooth_loss; either the
gauze is used to provide pressure as the tooth is moved back into its
corresponding socket, or the tooth is wrapped in gauze and placed in milk or
saline to keep it alive while the tooth is being transported or prepared for
reinsertion.[6]
In film and theatre, gauze is often fashioned into a scrim.
Gauze used in bookbinding is called mull, and is used in case binding to adhere
the text block to the book_cover.[7]
Modern gauze is also made of synthetic fibers, especially when used in
clothing. It can also be made of metal, such as a wire gauze placed on top of a
Bunsen_burner, used in a safety_lamp or spark_arrestor, or used as a fence.
**** Uses in chemistry[edit] ****
Main article: Wire_gauze
There are two types of wire_gauze used in chemistry: a normally woven wire
gauze, and one with a white circle imprinted on it. The latter has a ceramic
composite to aid in the dispersal of heat. The normal set-up is a square stand
with a support ring attached. The wire gauze is centered on the ring to allow
the flame to be in contact with it to a certain extent, depending on the
desired heat. In the context of laboratory experimentation, the combination of
the wire gauze plus the added ceramic composite aids the uniform dispersal of
heat. An object placed over this type of wire gauze will receive more uniform
heat from a Bunsen burner than a naked flame. This property is important in
various chemical processes where precise, even heat dispersal is needed. A
consistent heat can be crucial for the successful maintenance of the chemical
process intended. Because of this heat dispersal ability, wire gauze can be
used as a cooling surface for beakers, Erlenmeyer flasks or other vessels
without damaging the supporting surface.
