Density
Common symbols Ï
               D
SI unit       kg/m3
A graduated_cylinder containing various coloured liquids with different
densities
The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is
its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is Ï (the
lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used.
Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:[1]
         &#x03C1; =   m V     {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}}  [
      {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}}]
where Ï is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases (for
instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely
defined as its weight per unit volume,[2] although this is scientifically
inaccurate â this quantity is more specifically called specific_weight.
For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass
concentration. Different materials usually have different densities, and
density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium and iridium
are the densest known elements at standard_conditions_for_temperature_and
pressure but certain chemical compounds may be denser.
To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is
sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity "relative_density" or
"specific_gravity", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a
standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means
that the substance floats in water.
The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation
is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases.
Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and
thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a
few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most
materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from
the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid.
This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material.
The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its
specific_volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an
intensive_property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not
increase its density; rather it increases its mass.

***** History *****
In a well-known but probably apocryphal tale, Archimedes was given the task of
determining whether King_Hiero's goldsmith was embezzling gold during the
manufacture of a golden wreath dedicated to the gods and replacing it with
another, cheaper alloy.[3] Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath
could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and
compared with the mass; but the king did not approve of this. Baffled,
Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise
of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold
wreath through the displacement of the water. Upon this discovery, he leapt
from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, "Eureka! Eureka!"
(ÎÏÏÎ·ÎºÎ±! Greek "I have found it"). As a result, the term "eureka" entered
common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment.
The story first appeared in written form in Vitruvius' books_of_architecture,
two centuries after it supposedly took place.[4] Some scholars have doubted the
accuracy of this tale, saying among other things that the method would have
required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the
time.[5][6]
From the equation for density (Ï = m/V), mass density has units of mass
divided by volume. As there are many units of mass and volume covering many
different magnitudes there are a large number of units for mass density in use.
The SI unit of kilogram per cubic_metre (kg/m3) and the cgs unit of gram per
cubic_centimetre (g/cm3) are probably the most commonly used units for density.
One g/cm3 is equal to one thousand kg/m3. One cubic centimetre (abbreviation
cc) is equal to one millilitre. In industry, other larger or smaller units of
mass and or volume are often more practical and US_customary_units may be used.
See below for a list of some of the most common units of density.
***** Measurement of density *****
A number of techniques as well as standards exist for the measurement of
density of materials. Such techniques include the use of a hydrometer (a
buoyancy method for liquids), Hydrostatic balance (a buoyancy method for
liquids and solids), immersed body method (a buoyancy method for liquids),
pycnometer (liquids and solids), air comparison pycnometer (solids),
oscillating densitometer (liquids), as well as pour and tap (solids).[7]
However, each individual method or technique measures different types of
density (e.g. bulk density, skeletal density, etc.), and therefore it is
necessary to have an understanding of the type of density being measured as
well as the type of material in question.
**** Homogeneous materials ****
The density at all points of a homogeneous object equals its total mass divided
by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a scale_or_balance; the
volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the
displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a
hydrometer, a dasymeter or a Coriolis_flow_meter may be used, respectively.
Similarly, hydrostatic_weighing uses the displacement of water due to a
submerged object to determine the density of the object.
**** Heterogeneous materials ****
If the body is not homogeneous, then its density varies between different
regions of the object. In that case the density around any given location is
determined by calculating the density of a small volume around that location.
In the limit of an infinitesimal volume the density of an inhomogeneous object
at a point becomes:     &#x03C1; (    r &#x2192;    ) = d m  /  d V
{\displaystyle \rho ({\vec {r}})=dm/dV}  [{\displaystyle \rho ({\vec {r}})=dm/
dV}], where     d V   {\displaystyle dV}  [dV] is an elementary volume at
position     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r]. The mass of the body then can be
expressed as
         m =  &#x222B;  V   &#x03C1; (    r &#x2192;    )  d V .
      {\displaystyle m=\int _{V}\rho ({\vec {r}})\,dV.}  [
       m = \int_V \rho(\vec{r})\,dV.
      ]
**** Non-compact materials ****
In practice, bulk materials such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. Many
materials exist in nature as flakes, pellets, or granules.
Voids are regions which contain something other than the considered material.
Commonly the void is air, but it could also be vacuum, liquid, solid, or a
different gas or gaseous mixture.
The bulk volume of a materialâinclusive of the void fractionâis often
obtained by a simple measurement (e.g. with a calibrated measuring cup) or
geometrically from known dimensions.
Mass divided by bulk volume determines bulk_density. This is not the same thing
as volumetric mass density.
To determine volumetric mass density, one must first discount the volume of the
void fraction. Sometimes this can be determined by geometrical reasoning. For
the close-packing_of_equal_spheres the non-void fraction can be at most about
74%. It can also be determined empirically. Some bulk materials, however, such
as sand, have a variable void fraction which depends on how the material is
agitated or poured. It might be loose or compact, with more or less air space
depending on handling.
In practice, the void fraction is not necessarily air, or even gaseous. In the
case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantageous for measurement as
the void fraction for sand saturated in waterâonce any air bubbles are
thoroughly driven outâis potentially more consistent than dry sand measured
with an air void.
In the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determining
the mass of the material sample. If the material is under pressure (commonly
ambient air pressure at the earth's surface) the determination of mass from a
measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the
density of the void constituent, depending on how the measurement was
conducted. In the case of dry sand, sand is so much denser than air that the
buoyancy effect is commonly neglected (less than one part in one thousand).
Mass change upon displacing one void material with another while maintaining
constant volume can be used to estimate the void fraction, if the difference in
density of the two voids materials is reliably known.
***** Changes of density *****
Main articles: Compressibility and Thermal_expansivity
In general, density can be changed by changing either the pressure or the
temperature. Increasing the pressure always increases the density of a
material. Increasing the temperature generally decreases the density, but there
are notable exceptions to this generalization. For example, the density of
water increases between its melting point at 0 Â°C and 4 Â°C; similar behavior
is observed in silicon at low temperatures.
The effect of pressure and temperature on the densities of liquids and solids
is small. The compressibility for a typical liquid or solid is 10â6 barâ1
(1 bar = 0.1 MPa) and a typical thermal_expansivity is 10â5 Kâ1. This
roughly translates into needing around ten thousand times atmospheric pressure
to reduce the volume of a substance by one percent. (Although the pressures
needed may be around a thousand times smaller for sandy soil and some clays.) A
one percent expansion of volume typically requires a temperature increase on
the order of thousands of degrees Celsius.
In contrast, the density of gases is strongly affected by pressure. The density
of an ideal_gas is
         &#x03C1; =    M P   R T    ,   {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {MP}{RT}},}
      [{\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {MP}{RT}},}]
where M is the molar_mass, P is the pressure, R is the universal_gas_constant,
and T is the absolute_temperature. This means that the density of an ideal gas
can be doubled by doubling the pressure, or by halving the absolute
temperature.
In the case of volumic thermal expansion at constant pressure and small
intervals of temperature the temperature dependence of density is :
         &#x03C1; =    &#x03C1;   T  0      1 + &#x03B1; &#x22C5; &#x0394; T
      {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {\rho _{T_{0}}}{1+\alpha \cdot \Delta T}}}  [
      {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {\rho _{T_{0}}}{1+\alpha \cdot \Delta T}}}]
where      &#x03C1;   T  0       {\displaystyle \rho _{T_{0}}}  [\rho_{T_0}] is
the density at a reference temperature,     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }
[\alpha ] is the thermal expansion coefficient of the material at temperatures
close to      T  0     {\displaystyle T_{0}}  [T_{0}].
***** Density of solutions *****
The density of a solution is the sum of mass_(massic)_concentrations of the
components of that solution.
Mass (massic) concentration of each given component Ïi in a solution sums to
density of the solution.
         &#x03C1; =  &#x2211;  i    &#x03F1;  i      {\displaystyle \rho =\sum
      _{i}\varrho _{i}\,}  [\rho = \sum_i \varrho_i \,]
Expressed as a function of the densities of pure components of the mixture and
their volume_participation, it allows the determination of excess_molar
volumes:
         &#x03C1; =  &#x2211;  i    &#x03C1;  i      V  i   V    =  &#x2211;  i
      &#x03C1;  i    &#x03C6;  i   =  &#x2211;  i    &#x03C1;  i      V  i
      &#x2211;  i    V  i   +  &#x2211;  i      V  E     i
      {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}\rho _{i}{\frac {V_{i}}{V}}\,=\sum _{i}\rho
      _{i}\varphi _{i}=\sum _{i}\rho _{i}{\frac {V_{i}}{\sum _{i}V_{i}+\sum _
      {i}{V^{E}}_{i}}}}  [{\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}\rho _{i}{\frac {V_{i}}
      {V}}\,=\sum _{i}\rho _{i}\varphi _{i}=\sum _{i}\rho _{i}{\frac {V_{i}}
      {\sum _{i}V_{i}+\sum _{i}{V^{E}}_{i}}}}]
provided that there is no interaction between the components.
Knowing the relation between excess volumes and activity coefficients of the
components, one can determine the activity coefficients.
             V  E   &#x00AF;    i   = R T    &#x2202; ln &#x2061;  &#x03B3;  i
      &#x2202; P      {\displaystyle {\overline {V^{E}}}_{i}=RT{\frac {\partial
      \ln \gamma _{i}}{\partial P}}}  [{\displaystyle {\overline {V^{E}}}_
      {i}=RT{\frac {\partial \ln \gamma _{i}}{\partial P}}}]

***** Common units *****
The SI unit for density is:
    * kilogram per cubic_metre (kg/m3)
The litre and metric tons are not part of the SI, but are acceptable for use
with it, leading to the following units:
    * kilogram per litre (kg/L)
    * gram per millilitre (g/mL)
    * metric_ton per cubic metre (t/m3)
Densities using the following metric units all have exactly the same numerical
value, one thousandth of the value in (kg/m3). Liquid water has a density of
about 1 kg/dm3, making any of these SI units numerically convenient to use as
most solids and liquids have densities between 0.1 and 20 kg/dm3.
    * kilogram per cubic decimetre (kg/dm3)
    * gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm3)
          o 1 g/cm3 = 1000 kg/m3
    * megagram (metric ton) per cubic metre (Mg/m3)
In US_customary_units density can be stated in:
    * Avoirdupois_ounce per cubic_inch (1 g/cm3 â 0.578036672 oz/cu in)
    * Avoirdupois_ounce per fluid_ounce (1 g/cm3 â 1.04317556 oz/US fl oz =
      1.04317556 lb/US fl pint)
    * Avoirdupois_pound per cubic inch (1 g/cm3 â 0.036127292 lb/cu in)
    * pound per cubic_foot (1 g/cm3 â 62.427961 lb/cu ft)
    * pound per cubic_yard (1 g/cm3 â 1685.5549 lb/cu yd)
    * pound per US_liquid_gallon (1 g/cm3 â 8.34540445 lb/US gal)
    * pound per US bushel (1 g/cm3 â 77.6888513 lb/bu)
    * slug per cubic foot
Imperial_units differing from the above (as the Imperial gallon and bushel
differ from the US units) in practice are rarely used, though found in older
documents. The Imperial gallon was based on the concept that an Imperial_fluid
ounce of water would have a mass of one Avoirdupois ounce, and indeed 1 g/cm3
â 1.00224129 ounces per Imperial fluid ounce = 10.0224129 pounds per Imperial
gallon. The density of precious_metals could conceivably be based on Troy
ounces and pounds, a possible cause of confusion.
