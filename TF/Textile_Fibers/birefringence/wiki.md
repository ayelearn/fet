Birefringence is the optical property of a material having a refractive_index
that depends on the polarization and propagation direction of light.[1] These
optically anisotropic materials are said to be birefringent (or birefractive).
The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between
refractive indices exhibited by the material. Crystals with non-cubic crystal
structures are often birefringent, as are plastics under mechanical_stress.
Birefringence is responsible for the phenomenon of double refraction whereby a
ray of light, when incident upon a birefringent material, is split by
polarization into two rays taking slightly different paths. This effect was
first described by the Danish scientist Rasmus_Bartholin in 1669, who observed
it[2] in calcite, a crystal having one of the strongest birefringences. However
it was not until the 19th century that Augustin-Jean_Fresnel described the
phenomenon in terms of polarization, understanding light as a wave with field
components in transverse polarizations (perpendicular to the direction of the
wave vector).

is_thus_refracted_at_a_different_angle.]
Incoming light in the parallel (p) polarization sees a different effective
index_of_refraction than light in the perpendicular (s) polarization, and is
thus refracted at a different angle.
A mathematical description of wave propagation in a birefringent medium is
presented below. Following is a qualitative explanation of the phenomenon.
**** Uniaxial materials[edit] ****
The simplest type of birefringence is described as uniaxial, meaning that there
is a single direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions
perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent. Thus
rotating the material around this axis does not change its optical behavior.
This special direction is known as the optic_axis of the material. Light
propagating parallel to the optic axis (whose polarization is always
perpendicular to the optic axis) is governed by a refractive index no (for
"ordinary") regardless of its specific polarization. For rays with any other
propagation direction, there is one linear polarization that would be
perpendicular to the optic axis, and a ray with that polarization is called an
ordinary ray and is governed by the same refractive index value no. However,
for a ray propagating in the same direction but with a polarization
perpendicular to that of the ordinary ray, the polarization direction will be
partly in the direction of the optic axis, and this extraordinary ray will be
governed by a different, direction-dependent refractive index. Because the
index of refraction depends on the polarization, when unpolarized light enters
a uniaxial birefringent material, it is split into two beams travelling in
different directions, one having the polarization of the ordinary ray and the
other the polarization of the extraordinary ray. The ordinary ray will always
experience a refractive index of no, whereas the refractive index of the
extraordinary ray will be in between no and ne, depending on the ray direction
as described by the index_ellipsoid. The magnitude of the difference is
quantified by the birefringence:
         &#x0394; n =  n   e    &#x2212;  n   o     .   {\displaystyle \Delta
      n=n_{\mathrm {e} }-n_{\mathrm {o} }\,.}  [{\displaystyle \Delta n=n_
      {\mathrm {e} }-n_{\mathrm {o} }\,.}]
The propagation (as well as reflection_coefficient) of the ordinary ray is
simply described by no as if there were no birefringence involved. However the
extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in an
isotropic optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be
understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne).
However its power flow (given by the Poynting_vector) is not exactly in the
direction of the wave_vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam,
even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a
crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will
cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly
around that of the ordinary ray, which remains fixed.
When the light propagates either along or orthogonal to the optic axis, such a
lateral shift does not occur. In the first case, both polarizations are
perpendicular to the optic axis and see the same effective refractive index, so
there is no extraordinary ray. In the second case the extraordinary ray
propagates at a different phase velocity (corresponding to ne) but still has
the power flow in the direction of the wave_vector. A crystal with its optic
axis in this orientation, parallel to the optical surface, may be used to
create a waveplate, in which there is no distortion of the image but an
intentional modification of the state of polarization of the incident wave. For
instance, a quarter-wave_plate is commonly used to create circular_polarization
from a linearly polarized source.
**** Biaxial materials[edit] ****
The case of so-called biaxial crystals is substantially more complex.[3] These
are characterized by three refractive indices corresponding to three principal
axes of the crystal. For most ray directions, both polarizations would be
classified as extraordinary rays but with different effective refractive
indices. Being extraordinary waves, however, the direction of power flow is not
identical to the direction of the wave vector in either case.
The two refractive indices can be determined using the index_ellipsoids for
given directions of the polarization. Note that for biaxial crystals the index
ellipsoid will not be an ellipsoid of revolution ("spheroid") but is described
by three unequal principle refractive indices nÎ±, nÎ² and nÎ³. Thus there is
no axis around which a rotation leaves the optical properties invariant (as
there is with uniaxial crystals whose index ellipsoid is a spheroid).
Although there is no axis of symmetry, there are two optical axes or binormals
which are defined as directions along which light may propagate without
birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of
polarization.[3] For this reason, birefringent materials with three distinct
refractive indices are called biaxial. Additionally, there are two distinct
axes known as optical ray axes or biradials along which the group velocity of
the light is independent of polarization.
**** Double refraction[edit] ****
When an arbitrary beam of light strikes the surface of a birefringent material,
the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays
generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized_light consists of equal
amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light
(except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations.
According to Snell's_law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be
governed by the effective refractive_index which is different between these two
polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston_prism which
is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a
birefringent material such as calcite.
The different angles of refraction for the two polarization components are
shown in the figure at the top of the page, with the optic axis along the
surface (and perpendicular to the plane_of_incidence), so that the angle of
refraction is different for the p polarization (the "ordinary ray" in this
case, having its polarization perpendicular to the optic axis) and the s
polarization (the "extraordinary ray" with a polarization component along the
optic axis). In addition, a distinct form of double refraction occurs in cases
where the optic axis is not along the refracting surface (nor exactly normal to
it); in this case the electric_polarization of the birefringent material is not
exactly in the direction of the wave's electric_field for the extraordinary
ray. The direction of power flow (given by the Poynting_vector) for this
inhomogenous_wave is at a finite angle from the direction of the wave_vector
resulting in an additional separation between these beams. So even in the case
of normal incidence, where the angle of refraction is zero (according to
Snell's law, regardless of effective index of refraction), the energy of the
extraordinary ray may be propagated at an angle. This is commonly observed
using a piece of calcite cut appropriately with respect to its optic axis,
placed above a paper with writing, as in the above two photographs.
***** Terminology[edit] *****
Much of the work involving polarization preceded the understanding of light as
a transverse electromagnetic_wave, and this has affected some terminology in
use. Isotropic materials have symmetry in all directions and the refractive
index is the same for any polarization direction. An anisotropic material is
called "birefringent" because it will generally refract a single incoming ray
in two directions, which we now understand correspond to the two different
polarizations. This is true of either a uniaxial or biaxial material.
In a uniaxial material, one ray behaves according to the normal law of
refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray
at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface. However, as
explained above, the other polarization can be deviated from normal incidence,
which cannot be described using the law of refraction. This thus became known
as the extraordinary ray. The terms "ordinary" and "extraordinary" are still
applied to the polarization components perpendicular to and not perpendicular
to the optic axis respectively, even in cases where no double refraction is
involved.
A material is termed uniaxial when it has a single direction of symmetry in its
optical behavior, which we term the optic axis. It also happens to be the axis
of symmetry of the index ellipsoid (a spheroid in this case). The index
ellipsoid could still be described according to the refractive indices, nÎ±,
nÎ² and nÎ³, along three coordinate axes, however in this case two are equal.
So if nÎ± = nÎ² corresponding to the x and y axes, then the extraordinary index
is nÎ³ corresponding to the z axis, which is also called the optic axis in this
case.
However materials in which all three refractive indices are different are
termed biaxial and the origin of this term is more complicated and frequently
misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a
beam will travel at different phase velocities, except for rays in the
direction of what we call the optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the
particular property that rays in that direction do not exhibit birefringence,
with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of
refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices
are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principle directions
will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that
there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the
refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this
reason, these crystals were designated as biaxial, with the two "axes" in this
case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience
birefringence.
**** Fast and slow rays[edit] ****
In a birefringent material, a wave consists of two polarization components
which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-
called slow ray is the component for which the material has the higher
effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the fast ray is the
one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a
material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray
is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure at
the top of the page, it can be seen that refracted ray with s polarization in
the direction of the optic axis (thus the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in
this case.
Using a thin slab of that material at normal incidence, one would implement a
waveplate. In this case there is essentially no spatial separation between the
polarizations, however the phase of the wave in the parallel polarization (the
slow ray) will be retarded with respect to the perpendicular polarization.
These directions are thus known as the slow axis and fast axis of the
waveplate.
**** Positive or negative[edit] ****
Uniaxial birefringence is classified as positive when the extraordinary index
of refraction ne is greater than the ordinary index no. Negative birefringence
means that În = ne â no is less than zero.[4] In other words, the
polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the optic axis when
the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In
the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different
refractive indices, so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray
direction one can just as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.
***** Sources of optical birefringence[edit] *****
While birefringence is usually obtained using an anisotropic crystal, it can
result from an optically_isotropic material in a few ways:
    * Stress birefringence results when isotropic materials are stressed or
      deformed (i.e., stretched or bent) causing a loss of physical isotropy
      and consequently a loss of isotropy in the material's permittivity
      tensor.
    * Circular_birefringence in liquids where there is an enantiomeric_excess
      in a solution containing a molecule which has stereo_isomers.
    * Form birefringence, whereby structure elements such as rods, having one
      refractive index, are suspended in a medium with a different refractive
      index. When the lattice spacing is much smaller than a wavelength, such a
      structure is described as a metamaterial.
    * By the Kerr_effect, whereby an applied electric field induces
      birefringence at optical frequencies through the effect of nonlinear
      optics;
    * By the Faraday_effect, where a magnetic field causes some materials to
      become circularly_birefringent (having slightly different indices of
      refraction for left- and right-handed circular_polarizations), making the
      material optically active until the field is removed;
    * By the self or forced alignment into thin films of amphiphilic molecules
      such as lipids, some surfactants or liquid_crystals
***** Common birefringent materials[edit] *****

polarizers
The best characterized birefringent materials are crystals. Due to their
specific crystal_structures their refractive indices are well defined.
Depending on the symmetry of a crystal structure (as determined by one of the
32 possible crystallographic point groups), crystals in that group may be
forced to be isotropic (not birefringent), to have uniaxial symmetry, or
neither in which case it is a biaxial crystal. The crystal structures
permitting uniaxial and biaxial birefringence are noted in the two tables,
below, listing the two or three principal refractive indices (at wavelength
590 nm) of some better known crystals.[5]
Many plastics are birefringent because their molecules are "frozen" in a
stretched conformation when the plastic is molded or extruded.[6] For example,
ordinary cellophane is birefringent. Polarizers are routinely used to detect
stress in plastics such as polystyrene and polycarbonate.
Cotton fiber is birefringent because of high levels of cellulosic material in
the fiber's secondary cell wall.
Polarized light microscopy is commonly used in biological tissue, as many
biological materials are birefringent. Collagen, found in cartilage, tendon,
bone, corneas, and several other areas in the body, is birefringent and
commonly studied with polarized light microscopy.[7] Some proteins are also
birefringent, exhibiting form birefringence.[8]
Inevitable manufacturing imperfections in optical_fiber leads to birefringence,
which is one cause of pulse_broadening in fiber-optic_communications. Such
imperfections can be geometrical (lack of circular symmetry), due to stress
applied to the optical fiber and/or due to bending of the fiber. Birefringence
is intentionally introduced (for instance, by making the cross-section
elliptical) in order to produce polarization-maintaining_optical_fibers.
In addition to anisotropy in the electric polarizability (electric
susceptibility), anisotropy in the magnetic polarizability (magnetic
permeability) can also cause birefringence. However, at optical frequencies,
values of magnetic permeability for natural materials are not measurably
different from Âµ0, so this is not a source of optical birefringence in
practice.

***** Measurement[edit] *****
Birefringence and other polarization-based optical effects (such as optical
rotation and linear or circular_dichroism) can be measured by measuring the
changes in the polarization of light passing through the material. These
measurements are known as polarimetry. Polarized light microscopes, which
contain two polarizers that are at 90Â° to each other on either side of the
sample, are used to visualize birefringence. The addition of quarter-wave
plates permit examination of circularly polarized light. Birefringence
measurements have been made with phase-modulated systems for examining the
transient flow behavior of fluids.[9][10]
Birefringence of lipid_bilayers can be measured using dual_polarization
interferometry. This provides a measure of the degree of order within these
fluid layers and how this order is disrupted when the layer interacts with
other biomolecules.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Reflective twisted-nematic liquid-crystal_display. Light reflected by surface
(6) (or coming from a backlight) is horizontally polarized (5) and passes
through the liquid-crystal modulator (3) sandwiched in between transparent
layers (2, 4) containing electrodes. Horizontally polarized light is blocked by
the vertically oriented polarizer (1), except where its polarization has been
rotated by the liquid crystal (3), appearing bright to the viewer.
Birefringence is used in many optical devices. Liquid-crystal_displays, the
most common sort of flat_panel_display, cause their pixels to become lighter or
darker through rotation of the polarization (circular birefringence) of
linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet polarizer at the screen's
surface. Similarly, light_modulators modulate the intensity of light through
electrically_induced_birefringence of polarized light followed by a polarizer.
The Lyot_filter is a specialized narrowband spectral filter employing the
wavelength dependence of birefringence. Wave_plates are thin birefringent
sheets widely used in certain optical equipment for modifying the polarization
state of light passing through it.
Birefringence also plays an important role in second-harmonic_generation and
other nonlinear_optical_components, as the crystals used for this purpose are
almost always birefringent. By adjusting the angle of incidence, the effective
refractive index of the extraordinary ray can be tuned in order to achieve
phase_matching, which is required for efficient operation of these devices.
**** Medicine[edit] ****
Birefringence is utilized in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used
with optical microscopes is a pair of crossed polarizing filters. Light from
the source is polarized in the x direction after passing through the first
polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer)
oriented in the y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be
accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the
sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the x-polarized
light into the y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the
dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate
between positive and negative birefringence.
Urate crystals, with the crystals' long axis seen as horizontal in this view
being parallel to that of a red compensator filter. These appear as yellow, and
are thereby of negative birefringence.
For instance, needle aspiration of fluid from a gouty joint will reveal
negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals. Calcium_pyrophosphate
crystals, in contrast, show weak positive birefringence.[11] Urate crystals
appear yellow, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals appear blue when their long
axes are aligned parallel to that of a red compensator filter,[12] or a crystal
of known birefringence is added to the sample for comparison.
Birefringence can be observed in amyloid plaques such as are found in the
brains of Alzheimer's patients when stained with a dye such as Congo Red.
Modified proteins such as immunoglobulin light chains abnormally accumulate
between cells, forming fibrils. Multiple folds of these fibers line up and take
on a beta-pleated sheet conformation. Congo_red dye intercalates between the
folds and, when observed under polarized light, causes birefringence.
In ophthalmology, binocular retinal_birefringence_screening of the Henle fibers
(photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a
reliable detection of strabismus and possibly also of anisometropic_amblyopia.
[13] Furthermore, scanning_laser_polarimetry utilises the birefringence of the
optic_nerve fibre layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use
in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma.
Birefringence characteristics in sperm_heads allow the selection of spermatozoa
for intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection.[14] Likewise, zona_imaging uses
birefringence on oocytes to select the ones with highest chances of successful
pregnancy.[15] Birefringence of particles biopsied from pulmonary nodules
indicates silicosis.
Dermatologists use dermatascopes to view skin lesions. Dermatascopes use
polarized light, allowing the user to view crystalline structures corresponding
to dermal collagen in the skin. These structures may appear as shiny white
lines or rosette shapes and are only visible under polarized dermoscopy.
**** Stress-induced birefringence[edit] ****
Color pattern of a plastic box with "frozen in" mechanical_stress placed
between two crossed polarizers
Isotropic solids do not exhibit birefringence. However, when they are under
mechanical_stress, birefringence results. The stress can be applied externally
or is "frozen in" after a birefringent plastic ware is cooled after it is
manufactured using injection_molding. When such a sample is placed between two
crossed polarizers, colour patterns can be observed, because polarization of a
light ray is rotated after passing through a birefringent material and the
amount of rotation is dependent on wavelength. The experimental method called
photoelasticity used for analyzing stress distribution in solids is based on
the same principle. There has been recent research on using stress induced
birefringence in a glass plate to generate an Optical_vortex and full Poincare
beams (optical beams that have every possible polarization states across its
cross-section).[16]
**** Other cases of birefringence[edit] ****
Birefringent rutile observed in different polarizations using a rotating
polarizer (or analyzer)
Birefringence is observed in anisotropic elastic materials. In these materials,
the two polarizations split according to their effective refractive indices,
which are also sensitive to stress.
The study of birefringence in shear_waves traveling through the solid Earth
(the Earth's liquid core does not support shear waves) is widely used in
seismology.
Birefringence is widely used in mineralogy to identify rocks, minerals, and
gemstones.

In an isotropic medium (including free space) the so-called electric
displacement (D) is just proportional to the electric field (E) according to D
= ÉE where the material's permittivity Îµ is just a scalar (and equal to n2Îµ0
where n is the index_of_refraction). However, in an anisotropic material
exhibiting birefringence, the relationship between D and E must now be
described using a tensor equation:
          D  =  &#x03B5;   E    {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} =        
      {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}\mathbf {E} }  [{\displaystyle      (1)
      \mathbf {D} ={\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}\mathbf {E} }]
where Îµ is now a 3 Ã 3 permittivity tensor. We assume linearity and no
magnetic_permeability in the medium: Î¼ = Î¼0. The electric field of a plane
wave of angular frequency Ï can be written in the general form:
          E  =   E   0    e  i (  k  &#x22C5;  r  &#x2212; &#x03C9; t
      )     {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} =\mathbf {E} _{0}e^{i(\mathbf     
      {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} -\omega t)}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {E}      (2)
      =\mathbf {E} _{0}e^{i(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} -\omega
      t)}}]
where r is the position vector, t is time, and E0 is a vector describing the
electric field at r = 0, t = 0. Then we shall find the possible wave_vectors k.
By combining Maxwell's_equations for â Ã E and â Ã H, we can eliminate H
= 1/Î¼0B to obtain:
         &#x2212; &#x2207; &#x00D7; &#x2207; &#x00D7;  E  =
      &#x03BC;  0      &#x2202;  2    &#x2202;  t  2       D
      {\displaystyle -\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf {E} =\mu _    (3a)
      {0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}}\mathbf {D} }  [        
      {\displaystyle -\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf {E} =\mu _
      {0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}}\mathbf {D} }]
With no free charges, Maxwell's equation for the divergence of D vanishes:
         &#x2207; &#x22C5;  D  = 0   {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot        (3b)
      \mathbf {D} =0}  [{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {D} =0}]    
We can apply the vector identity â_Ã_(â_Ã_A)_=_â(â_â_A)_â_â2A
to the left hand side of eq._3a, and use the spatial dependence in which each
differentiation in x (for instance) results in multiplication by ikx to find:
         &#x2212; &#x2207; &#x00D7; &#x2207; &#x00D7;  E  = (  k
      &#x22C5;  E  )  k  &#x2212; (  k  &#x22C5;  k  )  E
      {\displaystyle -\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf {E} =
      (\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {E} )\mathbf {k} -(\mathbf {k}        (3c)
      \cdot \mathbf {k} )\mathbf {E} }  [{\displaystyle -\nabla        
      \times \nabla \times \mathbf {E} =(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf
      {E} )\mathbf {k} -(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {k} )\mathbf {E}
      }]
The right hand side of eq._3a can be expressed in terms of E through
application of the permittivity tensor Îµ and noting that differentiation in
time results in multiplication by âiÏ, eq._3a then becomes:
         ( &#x2212;  k  &#x22C5;  k  )  E  + (  k  &#x22C5;  E  )  k
      = &#x2212;  &#x03BC;  0    &#x03C9;  2   (  &#x03B5;   E  )
      {\displaystyle (-\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {k} )\mathbf {E} +
      (\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {E} )\mathbf {k} =-\mu _{0}\omega ^    (4a)
      {2}({\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}\mathbf {E} )}  [                 
      {\displaystyle (-\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {k} )\mathbf {E} +
      (\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {E} )\mathbf {k} =-\mu _{0}\omega ^
      {2}({\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}\mathbf {E} )}]
Applying the differentiation rule to eq._3b we find:
          k  &#x22C5;  D  = 0   {\displaystyle \mathbf {k} \cdot        
      \mathbf {D} =0}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {D}      (4b)
      =0}]
Eq._4b indicates that D is orthogonal to the direction of the wavevector k,
even though that is no longer generally true for E as would be the case in an
isotropic medium. Eq._4b will not be needed for the further steps in the
following derivation.
Finding the allowed values of k for a given Ï is easiest done by using
Cartesian_coordinates with the x, y and z axes chosen in the directions of the
symmetry axes of the crystal (or simply choosing z in the direction of the
optic axis of a uniaxial crystal), resulting in a diagonal matrix for the
permittivity tensor Îµ:
          &#x03B5;  =  &#x03B5;  0     [     n  x   2     0   0
      0    n  y   2     0     0   0    n  z   2      ]
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {\varepsilon } =\varepsilon _{0}{\begin    
      {bmatrix}n_{x}^{2}&0&0\\0&n_{y}^{2}&0\\0&0&n_{z}^{2}\end            (4c)
      {bmatrix}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {\varepsilon }
      =\varepsilon _{0}{\begin{bmatrix}n_{x}^{2}&0&0\\0&n_{y}^
      {2}&0\\0&0&n_{z}^{2}\end{bmatrix}}}]
where the diagonal values are squares of the refractive indices for
polarizations along the three principal axes x, y and z. With Îµ in this form,
and substituting in the speed of light c using c2 = 1/Î¼0Îµ0, eq._4a becomes
          (  &#x2212;  k  x   2   &#x2212;  k  y   2   &#x2212;  k
      z   2    )   E  x   +  k  x   2    E  x   +  k  x    k  y    E
      y   +  k  x    k  z    E  z   = &#x2212;     &#x03C9;  2    n
      x   2     c  2      E  x     {\displaystyle \left(-k_{x}^{2}-

where Ex, Ey, Ez are the components of E (at any given position in space and
time) and kx, ky, kz are the components of k. Rearranging, we can write (and
similarly for the y and z components of eq._4a)

This is a set of linear equations in Ex, Ey, Ez, so it can have a nontrivial

In the case of a uniaxial material, choosing the optic axis to be in the z

Setting either of the factors in eq._8 to zero will define an ellipsoidal
surface[note_1] in the space of wavevectors k that are allowed for a given Ï.
The first factor being zero defines a sphere; this is the solution for so-
called ordinary rays, in which the effective refractive index is exactly no
regardless of the direction of k. The second defines a spheroid symmetric about
the z axis. This solution corresponds to the so-called extraordinary rays in
which the effective refractive index is in between no and ne, depending on the
direction of k. Therefore, for any arbitrary direction of propagation (other
than in the direction of the optic axis), two distinct wavevectors k are
allowed corresponding to the polarizations of the ordinary and extraordinary
rays.
For a biaxial material a similar but more complicated condition on the two
waves can be described;[17] the allowed k vectors in a specified direction now
lie on one of two ellipsoids. By inspection one can see that eq._6 is generally
satisfied for two positive values of Ï. Or, for a specified optical frequency
Ï and direction normal to the wavefronts k/|k|, it is satisfied for two
wavenumbers (or propagation constants) |k| (and thus effective refractive
indices) corresponding to the propagation of two linear polarizations in that
direction.
When those two propagation constants are equal then the effective refractive
index is independent of polarization, and there is consequently no
birefringence encountered by a wave traveling in that particular direction. For
a uniaxial crystal, this is the optic axis, the z direction according to the
above construction. But when all three refractive indices (or permittivities),
nx, ny and nz are distinct, it can be shown that there are exactly two such
directions (where the two ellipsoids intersect); these directions are not at
all obvious and do not lie along any of the three principal axes (x, y, z
according to the above convention). Historically that accounts for the use of
the term "biaxial" for such crystals, as the existence of exactly two such
special directions (considered "axes") was discovered well before polarization
and birefringence were understood physically. However these two special
directions are generally not of particular interest; biaxial crystals are
rather specified by their three refractive indices corresponding to the three
axes of symmetry.
A general state of polarization launched into the medium can always be
decomposed into two waves, one in each of those two polarizations, which will
then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of
propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will
result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is
the principle of the waveplate for instance. However, when you have a wave
launched into a birefringent material at non-normal incidence, the problem is
yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only
have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors will not even be in exactly the
same direction (see figure at the top of the page). In this case the two k
vectors are rather solutions of eq._6 constrained by the boundary condition
which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and
the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the
interface, must all be identical.
