Inkjet printing is a type of computer_printing that recreates a digital_image
by propelling droplets of ink onto paper, plastic, or other substrates.[1]
Inkjet printers are the most commonly used type of printer,[2] and range from
small inexpensive consumer models to expensive professional machines.
The concept of inkjet printing originated in the 20th century, and the
technology was first extensively developed in the early 1950s. Starting in the
late 1970s, inkjet printers that could reproduce_digital_images generated by
computers were developed, mainly by Epson, Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Canon. In
the worldwide consumer market, four manufacturers account for the majority of
inkjet printer sales: Canon, HP, Epson and Brother.
The emerging ink_jet_material_deposition market also uses inkjet technologies,
typically printheads using piezoelectric crystals, to deposit materials
directly on substrates.
The technology has been extended and the 'ink' can now also comprise solder
paste in PCB_assembly, or living cells,[3] for creating biosensors and for
tissue_engineering.[4]
Images produced on inkjet printers are sometime sold under other names since
the term is associated with words like "digital", "computers", and "everyday
printing", which can have negative connotations in some contexts.[5] These
trade_names or coined_terms are usually used in the fine arts reproduction
field. They include Digigraph, Iris_prints (or GiclÃ©e), and Cromalin.[citation

***** Methods[edit] *****
There are two main technologies in use in contemporary inkjet printers:
continuous (CIJ) and drop-on-demand (DOD).
**** Continuous inkjet[edit] ****
Schematic diagram of a continuous inkjet printing process
The continuous inkjet (CIJ) method is used commercially for marking and coding
of products and packages. In 1867, Lord_Kelvin patented the syphon_recorder,
which recorded telegraph signals as a continuous trace on paper using an ink
jet nozzle deflected by a magnetic coil. The first commercial devices (medical
strip chart_recorders) were introduced in 1951 by Siemens.[6]
In CIJ technology, a high-pressure pump directs liquid ink from a reservoir
through a gunbody and a microscopic nozzle, creating a continuous stream of ink
droplets via the Plateau-Rayleigh_instability. A piezoelectric crystal creates
an acoustic wave as it vibrates within the gunbody and causes the stream of
liquid to break into droplets at regular intervals: 64,000 to 165,000 droplets
per second may be achieved.[citation_needed] The ink droplets are subjected to
an electrostatic field created by a charging electrode as they form; the field
varies according to the degree of drop deflection desired. This results in a
controlled, variable electrostatic charge on each droplet. Charged droplets are
separated by one or more uncharged "guard droplets" to minimize electrostatic
repulsion between neighbouring droplets.
The charged droplets pass through another electrostatic field and are directed
(deflected) by electrostatic deflection plates to print on the receptor
material (substrate), or allowed to continue on undeflected to a collection
gutter for re-use. The more highly charged droplets are deflected to a greater
degree. Only a small fraction of the droplets is used to print, the majority
being recycled.
CIJ is one of the oldest ink jet technologies in use and is fairly mature. The
major advantages are the very high velocity (â20 m/s) of the ink droplets,
which allows for a relatively long distance between print head and substrate,
and the very high drop ejection frequency, allowing for very high speed
printing. Another advantage is freedom from nozzle clogging as the jet is
always in use, therefore allowing volatile solvents such as ketones and
alcohols to be employed, giving the ink the ability to "bite" into the
substrate and dry quickly.[citation_needed]
The ink system requires active solvent regulation to counter solvent
evaporation during the time of flight (time between nozzle ejection and gutter
recycling), and from the venting process whereby air that is drawn into the
gutter along with the unused drops is vented from the reservoir. Viscosity is
monitored and a solvent (or solvent blend) is added to counteract solvent loss.
**** Drop-on-demand[edit] ****
Drop-on-demand (DOD) is divided into thermal DOD and piezoelectric DOD.

head will contain several such nozzles, and will be moved across the page as
paper advances through the printer.
*** Thermal DOD[edit] ***
A Canon inkjet with CMYK cartridges
Most consumer inkjet printers, including those from Canon (FINE Cartridge
system), Hewlett-Packard, and Lexmark, use the thermal inkjet process. The idea
of using thermal excitation to move tiny drops of ink was developed
independently by two groups at roughly the same time: John Vaught and a team at
Hewlett-Packard's Corvallis Division, and Canon engineer Ichiro Endo.
Initially, in 1977, Endo's team was trying to use the piezoelectric effect to
move ink out of the nozzle but noticed that ink shot out of a syringe when it
was accidentally heated with a soldering iron. Vaught's work started in late
1978 with a project to develop fast, low-cost printing. The team at HP found
that thin-film resistors could produce enough heat to fire an ink droplet. Two
years later the HP and Canon teams found out about each other's work.[7][8]
In the thermal inkjet process, the print cartridges consist of a series of tiny
chambers, each containing a heater, all of which are constructed by
photolithography. To eject a droplet from each chamber, a pulse of current is
passed through the heating element causing a rapid vaporization of the ink in
the chamber and forming a bubble, which causes a large pressure increase,
propelling a droplet of ink onto the paper (hence Canon's trade_name of Bubble
Jet). The ink's surface_tension, as well as the condensation and resultant
contraction of the vapor bubble, pulls a further charge of ink into the chamber
through a narrow channel attached to an ink reservoir. The inks involved are
usually water-based and use either pigments or dyes as the colorant. The inks
must have a volatile component to form the vapor bubble; otherwise droplet
ejection cannot occur. As no special materials are required, the print head is
generally cheaper to produce than in other inkjet technologies.
*** Piezoelectric DOD[edit] ***
Piezoelectric printing nozzle of an EPSON C20 printer.
Most commercial and industrial inkjet printers and some consumer printers
(those produced by Epson and Brother_Industries) use a piezoelectric_material
in an ink-filled chamber behind each nozzle instead of a heating element. When
a voltage is applied, the piezoelectric material changes shape, generating a
pressure pulse in the fluid, which forces a droplet of ink from the nozzle.
Piezoelectric (also called Piezo) inkjet allows a wider variety of inks than
thermal inkjet as there is no requirement for a volatile component, and no
issue with kogation (buildup of ink residue), but the print heads are more
expensive to manufacture due to the use of piezoelectric material (usually PZT,
lead_zirconium_titanate).
A DOD process uses software that directs the heads to apply between zero and
eight droplets of ink per dot, only where needed.[citation_needed] Piezo inkjet
technology is often used on production lines to mark products. For instance,
the "use-before" date is often applied to products with this technique; in this
application the head is stationary and the product moves past. This application
requires a relatively large gap between the print head and the substrate, but
also yields a high speed, a long service life, and low operating_cost.
***** Ink formulations[edit] *****
The basic problem with inkjet inks is the conflicting requirements for a
coloring agent that will stay on the surface vs. rapid dispersement of the
carrier fluid.[citation_needed]
Desktop inkjet printers, as used in offices or at home, tend to use aqueous
inks based on a mixture of water, glycol and dyes or pigments. These inks are
inexpensive to manufacture, but are difficult to control on the surface of
media, often requiring specially coated media. HP inks contain sulfonated
polyazo black dye (commonly used for dyeing leather), nitrates and other
compounds.[citation_needed] Aqueous inks are mainly used in printers with
thermal inkjet heads, as these heads require water to perform.
While aqueous inks often provide the broadest color_gamut and most vivid color,
most are not waterproof without specialized coating or lamination after
printing. Most Dye-based inks, while usually the least expensive, are subject
to rapid fading when exposed to light or ozone. Pigment-based aqueous inks are
typically more costly but provide much better long-term durability and
ultraviolet resistance. Inks marketed as "Archival_Quality" are usually
pigment-based.
Some professional wide format printers use aqueous inks, but the majority in
professional use today employ a much wider range of inks, most of which require
piezo inkjet heads and extensive maintenance:
  Solvent inks
      The main ingredient of these inks are volatile_organic_compounds_(VOCs),
      organic chemical compounds that have high vapor_pressures. Color is
      achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance.
      The chief advantage of solvent inks is that they are comparatively
      inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates,
      which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and
      adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent
      and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints
      made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-
      resistant (for_outdoor_use) without special over-coatings.[citation
      needed] The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special
      drying equipment, usually a combination of heaters and blowers. The
      substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads
      apply ink. Solvent inks are divided into two sub-categories: hard solvent
      ink offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but
      requires specialized ventilation of the printing area to avoid exposure
      to hazardous fumes, while Mild or "Eco" solvent inks, while still not as
      safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without
      specialized ventilation of the printing area. Mild solvent inks have
      rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and
      durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly.
  UV-curable inks
      These inks consist mainly of acrylic monomers with an initiator package.
      After printing, the ink is cured by exposure to strong UV-light. Ink is
      exposed to UV radiation where a chemical reaction takes place where the
      photo-initiators cause the ink components to cross-link into a solid.
      Typically a shuttered mercury-vapor lamp or UV LED is used for the curing
      process. Curing processes with high power for short periods of times
      (microseconds) allow curing inks on thermally sensitive substrates. UV
      inks do not evaporate, but rather cure or set as a result from this
      chemical reaction. No material is evaporated or removed, which means
      about 100% of the delivered volume is used to provide coloration. This
      reaction happens very quickly, which leads to instant drying that results
      in a completely cured graphic in a matter of seconds. This also allows
      for a very fast print process. As a result of this instant chemical
      reaction no solvents penetrate the substrate once it comes off the
      printer, which allows for high quality prints.[9][10] The advantage of
      UV-curable inks is that they "dry" as soon as they are cured, they can be
      applied to a wide range of uncoated substrates, and they produce a very
      robust image. Disadvantages are that they are expensive, require
      expensive curing modules in the printer, and the cured ink has a
      significant volume and so gives a slight relief on the surface. Though
      improvements are being made in the technology, UV-curable inks, because
      of their volume, are somewhat susceptible to cracking if applied to a
      flexible substrate. As such, they are often used in large "flatbed"
      printers, which print directly to rigid substrates such as plastic, wood
      or aluminium where flexibility is not a concern.
  Dye sublimation inks
      These inks contain special sublimation_dyes and are used to print
      directly or indirectly on to fabrics which consist of a high percentage
      of polyester fibres. A heating step causes the dyes to sublimate into the
      fibers and create an image with strong color and good durability.
  Hot melt inks
      These inks consist mainly of waxy_compounds which are heated past their
      melting point to enable printing, and which harden upon hitting the
      cooled substrate. Hot melt inks are typically used for masking processes.
      [11]
***** Printing heads[edit] *****
Inkjet heads: disposable head (left) and fixed head (right) with ink cartridge
(middle)
There are two main design philosophies in inkjet head design: fixed-head and
disposable head. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.
**** Fixed head[edit] ****
The fixed-head philosophy provides an inbuilt print head (often referred to as
a gaiter- head) that is designed to last for the life of the printer. The idea
is that because the head need not be replaced every time the ink runs out,
consumable costs can be made lower and the head itself can be more precise than
a cheap disposable one, typically requiring no calibration. On the other hand,
if a fixed head is damaged, obtaining a replacement head can become expensive,
if removing and replacing the head is even possible. If the printer's head
cannot be removed, the printer itself will then need to be replaced.
Fixed head designs are available in consumer products, but are more likely to
be found on industrial high-end printers and large format plotters. In the
consumer space, fixed-head printers are manufactured primarily by Epson and
Canon; however, many more recent Hewlett-Packard models use a fixed-head, such
as the Officejet Pro 8620 and HP's Pagewide series[12] Industrial fixed-head
print heads are manufactured by these companies: Kodak Versamark, Trident,
Xaar, Spectra (Dimatix), Hitachi / Ricoh, HP Scitex, Brother, Konica Minolta,
Seiko Epson, and ToshibaTec (a licensee of Xaar).[13]
**** Disposable head[edit] ****
Ink-jet cartridges
The disposable head philosophy uses a print head which is supplied as a part of
a replaceable ink_cartridge. Every time a cartridge is exhausted, the entire
cartridge and print head are replaced with a new one. This adds to the cost of
consumables and makes it more difficult to manufacture a high-precision head at
a reasonable cost, but also means that a damaged or clogged print head is only
a minor problem: the user can simply buy a new cartridge. Hewlett-Packard has
traditionally favoured the disposable print head, as did Canon in its early
models. This type of construction can also be seen as an effort by printer
manufacturers to stem third party ink cartridge assembly replacements, as these
would-be suppliers don't have the ability to manufacture specialized print
heads.
An intermediate method does exist: a disposable ink tank connected to a
disposable head, which is replaced infrequently (perhaps every tenth ink tank
or so). Most high-volume Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers use this setup, with
the disposable print heads used on lower volume models. A similar approach is
used by Kodak, where the printhead intended for permanent use is nevertheless
inexpensive and can be replaced by the user. Canon now uses (in most models)
replaceable print heads which are designed to last the life of the printer, but
can be replaced by the user should they become clogged.
**** Cleaning mechanisms[edit] ****
[File:Epson Stylus S22 - covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber
cap.webm]Play_media
Video: covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap
The primary cause of inkjet printing problems is ink drying on the printhead's
nozzles, causing the pigments and dyes to dry out and form a solid block of
hardened mass that plugs the microscopic ink passageways. Most printers attempt
to prevent this drying from occurring by covering the printhead nozzles with a
rubber cap when the printer is not in use. Abrupt power losses, or unplugging
the printer before it has capped the printhead, can cause the printhead to be
left in an uncapped state. Even when the head is capped, this seal is not
perfect, and over a period of several weeks the moisture (or other solvent) can
still seep out, causing the ink to dry and harden. Once ink begins to collect
and harden, the drop volume can be affected, drop trajectory can change, or the
nozzle can completely fail to jet ink.
To combat this drying, nearly all inkjet printers include a mechanism to
reapply moisture to the printhead. Typically there is no separate supply of
pure ink-free solvent available to do this job, and so instead the ink itself
is used to remoisten the printhead. The printer attempts to fire all nozzles at
once, and as the ink sprays out, some of it wicks across the printhead to the
dry channels and partially softens the hardened ink. After spraying, a rubber
wiper blade is swept across the printhead to spread the moisture evenly across
the printhead, and the jets are again all fired to dislodge any ink clumps
blocking the channels.
Some printers use a supplemental air-suction pump, using the rubber capping
station to suck ink through a severely clogged cartridge. The suction pump
mechanism is frequently driven by the page feed stepper_motor: it is connected
to the end of the shaft. The pump only engages when the shaft turns backwards,
hence the rollers reversing while head cleaning. Due to the built-in head
design, the suction pump is also needed to prime the ink channels inside a new
printer, and to reprime the channels between ink tank changes.
Professional solvent- and UV-curable ink wide-format inkjet printers generally
include a "manual clean" mode that allows the operator to manually clean the
print heads and capping mechanism and to replace the wiper blades and other
parts used in the automated cleaning processes. The volume of ink used in these
printers often leads to "overspray" and therefore buildup of dried ink in many
places that automated processes are not capable of cleaning.
The ink consumed in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink
from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the spittoon, and in
Hewlett Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/
wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in
a pan underneath the paper feed platen. For printers several years old, it is
common for the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and
touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers
using solvent inks may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste
ink and solvent which must be emptied or replaced when full.
Labyrinth air vent tubes on the top of an Epson Stylus Photo 5-color ink tank.
The long air channels are molded into the top of the tank and the blue label
seals the channels into long tubes. The yellow label is removed prior to
installation, and opens the tube ends to the atmosphere so that ink can be
sprayed onto the paper. Removing the blue label would destroy the tubes and
cause the moisture to quickly evaporate
There is a second type of ink drying that most printers are unable to prevent.
For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed
ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to 10 cm
long, wrapping back and forth across the ink tank. The channel is long and
narrow to reduce moisture evaporation through the vent tube, but some
evaporation still occurs and eventually the ink cartridge dries up from the
inside out. To combat this problem, which is especially acute with professional
fast-drying solvent inks, many wide-format printer cartridge designs contain
the ink in an airtight, collapsible bag that requires no vent. The bag merely
shrinks until the cartridge is empty.
The frequent cleaning conducted by some printers can consume quite a bit of ink
and has a great impact on cost-per-page determinations.
Clogged nozzles can be detected by printing a standard test pattern on the
page. Some software workaround methods are known for re-routing printing
information from a clogged nozzle to a working nozzle.[14]

Compared to earlier consumer-oriented color printers, inkjet printers have a
number of advantages. They are quieter in operation than impact dot_matrix or
daisywheel_printers. They can print finer, smoother details through higher
resolution. Consumer inkjet printers with photographic-quality printing are
widely available.
In comparison to technologies like thermal_wax, dye_sublimation, and laser
printing, inkjets have the advantage of practically no warm up time, and often
lower cost per page. However, low-cost laser printers can have lower per-page
costs, at least for black-and-white printing, and possibly for color.
For some inkjet printers, monochrome ink sets are available either from the
printer manufacturer or from third-party suppliers. These allow the inkjet
printer to compete with the silver-based photographic papers traditionally used
in black-and-white photography, and provide the same range of tones: neutral,
"warm" or "cold". When switching between full-color and monochrome ink sets, it
is necessary to flush out the old ink from the print head with a cleaning
cartridge. Special software or at least a modified device_driver are usually
required, to deal with the different color_mapping.
Some types of industrial inkjet printers are now capable of printing at very
high speeds, in wide formats, or for a variety of industrial applications
ranging from signage, textiles, ceramics and 3-D printing into biomedical
applications and conductive circuitry. Leading companies and innovators in
hardware include HP, Epson, Canon, Konica Minolta, FujiFilm, EFi, Durst,
Brother, Roland, Mimaki, Mutoh and many others worldwide.
***** Disadvantages[edit] *****
                   This article's Criticism or Controversy section may

                   subject. Please integrate_the_section's_contents into the

Many "intelligent" ink cartridges contain a microchip that communicates the
estimated ink level to the printer; this may cause the printer to display an
error message, or incorrectly inform the user that the ink cartridge is empty.
In some cases, these messages can be ignored, but some inkjet printers will
refuse to print with a cartridge that declares itself empty, to prevent
consumers from refilling cartridges. For example, Epson embeds a chip which
prevents printing when the chip claims the cartridge is empty, although a
researcher who over-rode the system found that in one case he could print up to
38% more good quality pages, even though the chip stated that the cartridge was
empty.[15] Third-party ink suppliers sell ink cartridges at significant
discounts (at least 10â30% off OEM cartridge prices, sometimes up to 95%,
typically averaging around 50%), and also bulk ink and cartridge self-refill
kits at even lower prices. Many vendors' "intelligent" ink cartridges have been
reverse-engineered. It is now possible to buy inexpensive devices to reliably
reset such cartridges to report themselves as full, so that they may be
refilled many times.
The very narrow inkjet nozzles are prone to clogging. The ink consumed cleaning
themâeither during cleaning invoked by the user, or in many cases, performed
automatically by the printer on a routine scheduleâcan account for a
significant proportion of the ink used in the machine. Inkjet printing head
nozzles can be cleaned using specialized solvents; or by soaking in warm
distilled water for short periods of time, for water-soluble inks.
The high cost of OEM ink cartridges and the intentional obstacles to refilling
them have been addressed by the growth of third-party ink suppliers. Many
printer manufacturers discourage customers from using third-party inks, stating
that they can damage the print heads due to not being the same formulation as
the OEM inks, cause leaks, and produce inferior-quality output (e.g. of
incorrect color gamut). Consumer_Reports has noted that some third-party
cartridges may contain less ink than OEM cartridges, and thus yield no cost
savings,[16] while Wilhelm_Imaging_Research claims that with third-party inks
the lifetime of prints may be considerably reduced.[17] However, an April 2007
review showed that, in a double-blind test, reviewers generally preferred the
output produced using third-party ink over OEM ink.[18] In general, OEM inks
have undergone significant system reliability testing with the cartridge and
print-head materials, whereas R&D efforts on third-party ink material
compatibility are likely to be significantly less. Some inkjet manufacturers
have tried to prevent cartridges being refilled using various schemes including
fitting chips to the cartridges that log how much the cartridge has printed and
prevent the operation of a refilled cartridge.
The warranty on a printer may not apply if the printer is damaged by the use of
non-approved supplies. In the US the MagnusonâMoss_Warranty_Act is a federal
law which states that warrantors cannot require that only brand name parts and
supplies be used with their products, as some printer manufacturers imply.
However, this would not apply if non-approved items cause damage. In the UK, a
printer manufacturer cannot lawfully impose such conditions as part of its
warranty (Regina Vs Ford Motor Company refers) although many attempt to do so
illegally. As long as the product used was sold as being for the printer it was
used in, then the sale of goods act applies, and anything so sold must be "of
merchandisable quality and fit for purpose". Moreover, under UK law, it is the
retailer and not the manufacturer that is legally liable, for 2 years on
electrically operated items specifically, and as such the retailer is where one
would seek redress.[19]

Inkjet documents can have poor to excellent archival durability, depending on
the quality of the inks and paper used. If low-quality paper is used, it can
yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the untreated pulp; in the worst
case, old prints can literally crumble into small particles when handled. High-
quality inkjet prints on acid-free_paper can last as long as typewritten or
handwritten documents on the same paper.
Because the ink used in many low-cost consumer inkjets is water-soluble, care
must be taken with inkjet-printed documents to avoid even the smallest drop of
moisture, which can cause severe "blurring" or "running". In extreme cases,
even sweaty fingertips during hot humid weather could cause low-quality inks to
smear. Similarly, water-based highlighter markers can blur inkjet-printed
documents and discolor the highlighter's tip. The lifetime of inkjet prints
produced using aqueous inks is generally shorter (although UV-resistant inks
are available) than those produced with solvent-based inkjets; however, so-
called "archival inks" have been produced for use in aqueous-based machines
which offer extended life.
In addition to smearing, gradual fading of many inks can be a problem over
time. Print lifetime is highly dependent on the quality and formulation of the
ink. The earliest inkjet printers, intended for home and small office
applications, used dye-based inks. Even the best dye-based inks are not as
durable as pigment-based inks, which are now available for many inkjet
printers. Many inkjet printers now utilize pigment based inks which are highly
water resistant: at least the black ink is often pigment-based. Resin or
silicone protected photopaper is widely available at low cost, introducing
complete water and mechanical rub resistance for dye and pigment inks. The
photopaper itself must be designed for pigment or for dye inks, as pigment
particles are too large to be able to penetrate through dye-only photopaper
protection layer.
The highest-quality inkjet prints are often called "giclÃ©e" prints, to
distinguish them from less-durable and lower-cost prints. However, the use of
the term is no guarantee of quality, and the inks and paper used must be
carefully investigated before an archivist can rely on their long-term
durability.
To increase the durability of inkjet printer prints, more attention is needed
for the inkjet ink cartridge. One way to treat ink cartridges on an inkjet
printer is to maintain the temperature of the printer itself. Excessive
variation in space temperature is very bad for printer ink cartridges. The user
should prevent the printer becoming too hot or too chilly as the cartridges can
dry up. For lasting printer efficiency, the user should ensure the area has a
regular and steady temperature level.[20]

Inkjets use solvent-based inks which have much shorter expiration dates
compared to laser toner, which has an indefinite shelf life.[citation_needed]
Inkjet printers tend to clog if not used regularly, whereas laser printers are
much more tolerant of intermittent use.[citation_needed] Inkjet printers
require periodical head cleaning, which consumes a considerable amount of ink,
and will drive printing costs higher especially if the printer is unused for
long periods.
If an inkjet head becomes clogged, third-party ink solvents/head cleaners and
replacement heads are available in some cases. The cost of such items may be
less expensive compared to a transfer unit for a laser printer, but the laser
printer unit has a much longer lifetime between required maintenance. Many
inkjet printer models now have permanently installed heads, which cannot be
economically replaced if they become irreversibly clogged, resulting in
scrapping of the entire printer. On the other hand, inkjet printer designs
which use a disposable printhead usually cost significantly more per page than
printers using permanent heads.[citation_needed] By contrast, laser printers do
not have printheads to clog or replace frequently, and usually can produce many
more pages between maintenance intervals.
Inkjet printers have traditionally produced better quality output than color
laser printers when printing photographic material. Both technologies have
improved dramatically over time, although the best quality giclee prints
favored by artists use what is essentially a high-quality specialized type of
inkjet printer.
***** Business model[edit] *****
Microchips from Epson ink cartridges. These are tiny printed_circuit_boards; a
deposit of black epoxy covers_the_chip itself
A common business model for inkjet printers involves selling the actual printer
at or below production cost, while dramatically marking up the price of the
(proprietary) ink cartridges (a profit model called "Freebie_marketing"). Most
current inkjet printers attempt to enforce this product_tying by
anticompetitive measures such as microchips in the cartridges to hinder the use
of third-party or refilled ink cartridges. The microchips monitor usage and
report the ink remaining to the printer. Some manufacturers also impose
"expiration dates". When the chip reports that the cartridge is empty (or out
of date) the printer stops printing. Even if the cartridge is refilled, the
microchip will indicate to the printer that the cartridge is depleted. For many
models (especially from Canon), the 'empty' status can be overridden by
entering a 'service code' (or sometimes simply by pressing the 'start' button
again).[21] For some printers, special circuit "flashers" are available that
reset the quantity of remaining ink to the maximum.[22][23][24][25]
Some manufacturers, most notably Epson and Hewlett_Packard, have been accused
of indicating that a cartridge is depleted while a substantial amount of ink
remains.[26][27] A 2007 study found that most printers waste a significant
quantity of ink when they declare a cartridge to be empty. Single-ink
cartridges were found to have on average 20% of their ink remaining, though
actual figures range from 9% to 64% of the cartridge's total ink capacity,
depending on the brand and model of printer.[28][29] This problem is further
compounded with the use of one-piece multi-ink cartridges, which are declared
empty as soon as one color runs low. Of great annoyance to many users are those
printers that will refuse to print documents requiring only black ink, just
because one or more of the color ink cartridges is depleted.
In recent years, many consumers have begun to challenge the business practices
of printer manufacturers, such as charging up to US$8,000 per gallon (US$2,100
per liter) for printer ink.[30] Alternatives for consumers are cheaper copies
of cartridges, produced by third parties, and the refilling of cartridges,
using refill kits. Due to the large differences in price caused by OEM markups,
there are many companies selling third-party ink cartridges. Most printer
manufacturers discourage refilling disposable cartridges or using aftermarket
copy cartridges, and say that use of incorrect inks may cause poor image
quality due to differences in viscosity, which can affect the amount of ink
ejected in a drop, and color consistency, and can damage the printhead.
Nonetheless, the use of alternative cartridges and inks has been gaining in
popularity, threatening the business model of printer manufacturers. Printer
companies such as HP, Lexmark, and Epson have used patents and the DMCA to
launch lawsuits against third-party vendors.[31][32] An anti-trust class-action
lawsuit was launched in the US against HP and office supply chain Staples_Inc,
alleging that HP paid Staples $100 million to keep inexpensive third-party ink
cartridges off the shelves.[33][34]
In Lexmark_Int'l_v._Static_Control_Components, the United_States_Court_of
Appeals_for_the_Sixth_Circuit ruled that circumvention of this technique does
not violate the Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act.[35] The European_Commission
[citation_needed] also ruled this practice anticompetitive: it will disappear
in newer models sold in the European Union. [36] While the DMCA case dealt with
copyright protection, companies also rely on patent protection to prevent
copying and refilling of cartridges. For example, if a company devises all of
the ways in which their microchips can be manipulated and cartridges can be
refilled and patents these methods, they can prevent anyone else from refilling
their cartridges[citation_needed]. Patents protecting the structure of their
cartridges prevent the sale of cheaper copies of the cartridges. For some
printer models (notably those from Canon) the manufacturer's own microchip can
be removed and fitted to a compatible cartridge thereby avoiding the need to
replicate the microchip (and risk prosecution). Other manufacturers embed their
microchips deep within the cartridge in an effort to prevent this approach.
In 2007 Eastman_Kodak entered the inkjet market with its own line of All-In-One
printers based on a marketing model that differed from the prevailing practice
of selling the printer at a loss while making large profits on replacement ink
cartridges. Kodak claimed that consumers could save up to 50 percent on
printing by using its lower cost cartridges filled with the companyâs
proprietary pigmented colorants while avoiding the potential problems
associated with off-brand inks.[37] This strategy proved unsuccessful and Kodak
exited the consumer inkjet printer business in 2012.
***** Printer types[edit] *****
**** Professional models[edit] ****
In addition to the widely used small inkjet printers for home and office, there
are professional inkjet printers, some for "page-width" format printing and
many for wide format printing. Page-width format means that the print width
ranges from about 8.5â37 in (22â94 cm). "Wide format" means print width
ranging from 24" up to 15' (about 60 cm to 5 m). The most common application of
page-width printers is in printing high-volume business communications that do
not need high-quality layout and color. Particularly with the addition of
variable_data technologies, the page-width printers are important in billing,
tagging, and individualized catalogs and newspapers. The application of most
wide format printers is in printing advertising graphics; a lower-volume
application is printing of design documents by architects or engineers. But
nowadays, there are inkjet printers for digital_textile_printing up to 64" wide
with good High Definition image 1440x720 dpi.[38][39]
Another specialty application for inkjets is producing prepress color proofs
for printing jobs created digitally. Such printers are designed to give
accurate color rendition of how the final image will look (a "proof") when the
job is finally produced on a large volume press such as a four-colour offset
lithography press. An example is an Iris_printer, whose output is what the
French term GiclÃ©e was coined for.
The largest-volume supplier is Hewlett-Packard, which supply over 90 percent of
the market for printers for printing technical drawings. The major products in
their Designjet series are the Designjet 500/800, the Designjet T Printer
series (including the T1100 and T610), the Designjet 1050 and the Designjet
4000/4500. They also have the HP_Designjet_5500, a six-color printer that is
used especially for printing graphics as well as the new Designjet Z6100 which
sits at the top of the HP Designjet range and features an eight colour pigment
ink system.
Epson, Kodak, and Canon also manufacture wide-format printers, sold in much
smaller numbers than standard printers. Epson has a group of 3 Japanese
companies around it that predominantly use Epson piezo printheads and inks:
Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh.
Scitex Digital Printing developed high-speed, variable-data, inkjet printers
for production printing, but sold its profitable assets associated with the
technology to Kodak in 2005 who now market the printers as Kodak Versamark
VJ1000, VT3000, and VX5000 printing systems. These roll-fed printers can print
at up to 1000 feet per minute.
Professional high-volume inkjet printers are made by a range of companies.
These printers can range in price from US$35,000 to $2 million. Carriage widths
on these units can range from 54" to 192" (about 1.4 to 5 m), and ink
technologies have tended toward solvent, eco-solvent, and UV-curing with a more
recent focus toward water-based (aqueous) ink sets. Major applications where
these printers are used are for outdoor settings for billboards, truck sides
and truck curtains, building graphics and banners, while indoor displays
include point-of-sales displays, backlit displays, exhibition graphics, and
museum graphics.
The major suppliers for professional wide- and grand-format printers include:
EFI,[40] LexJet, Grapo, Inca, Durst, OcÃ©, NUR (now part of Hewlett-Packard),
LÃ¼scher, VUTEk, Scitex_Vision (now part of Hewlett-Packard), Mutoh, Mimaki,
Roland DG, Seiko I Infotech, IQDEMY,[41] Leggett and Platt, Agfa, Raster
Printers, DGI and MacDermid ColorSpan (now part of Hewlett-Packard),
swissqprint.
**** SOHO multifunction inkjet photo printers[edit] ****
SOHO multifunction inkjet printers for photo_printing use up to 6 different
inks:
    * Canon: cyan, yellow, magenta, black, pigment black, gray. 1 pl thermal.
      [42]
    * Epson: cyan, yellow, magenta, light cyan, light magenta, black. 1.5 pl
      piezo variable. Also with A3 paper printing,[43] or FAX and duplex ADF.
      [44]
**** Professional inkjet photo printers[edit] ****
Inkjet printers for professional photo printing use up to 12 different inks:
    * Canon: photo magenta, photo cyan, yellow, magenta, cyan, red, photo
      black, matte black, grey, plus either blue, photo gray, and one chroma
      optimiser for black density and uniform glossiness,[45] or light gray,
      dark gray and one chroma optimiser,[46] or green, blue, and photo gray.
      [47] 4 pl thermal.
    * Epson (10 colors from 12): vivid magenta, yellow, cyan, orange, green,
      vivid light magenta, light cyan, light black, matte black or photo black,
      plus an irreversible choice of either light light gray or violet (V not
      for photo).[48] 3.5 pl piezo variable.
    * HP: magenta, yellow, red, green, blue, light magenta, light cyan, gray,
      light gray, matte black, photo black, and one gloss enhancer.[49] 4 pl
      thermal.
They can print an image of 36 megapixels on A3 borderless photo paper with 444
ppi.[50]
***** Other uses[edit] *****
U.S. Patent 6,319,530 describes a "Method of photocopying an image onto an
edible web for decorating iced baked goods". In other words, this invention
enables one to inkjet print a food-grade color photograph on a birthday_cake's
surface. Many bakeries now carry these types of decorations, which are
printable using edible inks and dedicated inkjet printers.[51] Edible_ink
printing can be done using normal home use inkjet printers like Canon Bubble
Jet printers with edible ink cartridges installed, and using rice paper or
frosting sheets.[52]
Inkjet printers and similar technologies are used in the production of many
microscopic items. See Microelectromechanical_systems.
Inkjet printers are used to form conductive traces for circuits, and color
filters in LCD and plasma displays.
Inkjet printers, especially models produced by Dimatix (now part of Fujifilm),
Xennia Technology and Pixdro, are in fairly common use in many labs around the
world for developing alternative deposition methods that reduce consumption of
expensive, rare, or problematic materials. These printers have been used in the
printing of polymer, macromolecular, quantum dot, metallic nanoparticles,
carbon nanotubes etc. The applications of such printing methods include organic
thin-film transistors, organic light emitting diodes, organic_solar_cells,
sensors, etc.[5][53]
Inkjet technology is used in the emerging field of bioprinting.
