Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including
cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, from hide and fur
clothing from bison, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from
camelids;[1] additionally, the Highland and the Mangalica breeds of cattle and
swine, respectively, possess wooly coats.
Wool consists of protein together with a few percent lipids. In this regard it
is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton, which is
mainly cellulose.[1]

***** Characteristics[edit] *****
Champion hogget fleece, Walcha Show
Wool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These
follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and
push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow.
Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary
follicles produce three types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers, and true wool
fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers
share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and
elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out.[2]

Wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the
individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the
crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air,
which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high specific_thermal
resistance, so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited
desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation.
Felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation as the
microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together.
Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair/fur: it is crimped and
elastic.[3]
The amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers. A fine wool
like Merino may have up to 100 crimps per inch, while coarser wool like karakul
may have as few as one or two. In contrast, hair has little if any scale and no
crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the
fleece is called kemp. The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to
breed and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding
into batts for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous tweed
cloth of Scotland.
Wool fibers readily_absorb_moisture, but are not hollow. Wool can absorb almost
one-third of its own weight in water.[4] Wool absorbs sound like many other
fabrics. It is generally a creamy white color, although some breeds of sheep
produce natural colors, such as black, brown, silver, and random mixes.
Wool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic fibers. It
has a lower rate of flame_spread, a lower rate of heat release, a lower heat of
combustion, and does not melt or drip;[5] it forms a char that is insulating
and self-extinguishing, and it contributes less to toxic gases and smoke than
other flooring products when used in carpets.[6] Wool carpets are specified for
high safety environments, such as trains and aircraft. Wool is usually
specified for garments for firefighters, soldiers, and others in occupations
where they are exposed to the likelihood of fire.[6]
Wool causes an allergic_reaction in some people.[7]
***** Processing[edit] *****
**** Shearing[edit] ****
Fine Merino shearing Lismore,_Victoria
Main article: Sheep_shearing
Sheep_shearing is the process by which the woolen fleece of a sheep is cut off.
After shearing, the wool is separated into four main categories: fleece (which
makes up the vast bulk), broken, bellies, and locks. The quality of fleeces is
determined by a technique known as wool_classing, whereby a qualified person,
called a wool classer, groups wools of similar gradings together to maximize
the return for the farmer or sheep owner. In Australia before being auctioned,
all Merino fleece wool is objectively measured for micron, yield (including the
amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes
color and comfort factor.
**** Scouring[edit] ****
Wool before and after scouring
Wool straight off a sheep, known as "greasy wool"[8] or "wool in the grease",
contains a high level of valuable lanolin, as well as the sheep's dead skin and
sweat residue, and generally also contains pesticides and vegetable matter from
the animal's environment. Before the wool can be used for commercial purposes,
it must be scoured, a process of cleaning the greasy wool. Scouring may be as
simple as a bath in warm water or as complicated as an industrial process using
detergent and alkali in specialized equipment.[9] In north_west_England,
special potash_pits were constructed to produce potash used in the manufacture
of a soft soap for scouring locally produced white wool.
In commercial wool, vegetable matter is often removed by chemical
carbonization.[10] In less-processed wools, vegetable matter may be removed by
hand and some of the lanolin left intact through the use of gentler detergents.
This semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly
water-resistant_mittens_or_sweaters, such as those of the Aran_Island
fishermen. Lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products, such
as hand creams.
***** Fineness and yield[edit] *****
Raw wool has many impurities; vegetable matter, sand, dirt and yolk which is a
mixture of suint (sweat), grease, urine stains and dung locks. The sheep's body
yields many types of wool with differing strengths, thicknesses, length of
staple and impurities. The raw wool (greasy) is processed into 'top'. 'Worsted
top' requires strong straight and parallel fibres.

Near        Sides         Fine uniform and strong
Downrights  Neck          Short and irregular, lower quality

[11]
Various types and natural colors of wool, and a picture made from wool
The quality of wool is determined by its fiber diameter, crimp, yield, color,
and staple strength. Fiber diameter is the single most important wool
characteristic determining quality and price.
Merino wool is typically 3â5 inches in length and is very fine (between 12
and 24 microns).[12] The finest and most valuable wool comes from Merino
hoggets. Wool taken from sheep produced for meat is typically more coarse, and
has fibers 1.5 to 6 in (38 to 152 mm) in length. Damage or breaks in the wool
can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in
a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break.[13]
Wool is also separated into grades based on the measurement of the wool's
diameter in microns and also its style. These grades may vary depending on the
breed or purpose of the wool. For example:
                Merinos
Diameter in microns Name
< 15.5              Ultrafine Merino[8]
15.6 â 18.5    Superfine Merino
18.6 â 20      Fine Merino[8]
20.1 â 23      Medium Merino
> 23                Strong Merino[8]
                                          Breeds
Breeds    Diameter
Comeback  21â26 microns, white, 90â180 mm long
Fine      27â31 microns, Corriedales, etc.
crossbred
Medium    32â35 microns
crossbred
Downs     23â34 microns, typically lacks luster and brightness. Examples, Aussiedown,
          Dorset_Horn, Suffolk, etc.[14]
Coarse    >36 microns
crossbred
Carpet    35â45 microns[8]
wools
Any wool finer than 25 microns can be used for garments, while coarser grades
are used for outerwear or rugs. The finer the wool, the softer it is, while
coarser grades are more durable and less prone to pilling.
The finest Australian and New Zealand Merino wools are known as 1PP, which is
the industry benchmark of excellence for Merino wool 16.9 microns and finer.
This style represents the top level of fineness, character, color, and style as
determined on the basis of a series of parameters in accordance with the
original dictates of British wool as applied by the Australian Wool Exchange
(AWEX) Council. Only a few dozen of the millions of bales auctioned every year
can be classified and marked 1PP.[15]
In the United States, three classifications of wool are named in the Wool
Products Labeling Act of 1939.[16] Wool is "the fiber from the fleece of the
sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include the so-
called specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna)
which has never been reclaimed from any woven or felted wool product".[16]
"Virgin wool" and "new wool" are also used to refer to such never used wool.
There are two categories of recycled wool (also called reclaimed or shoddy
wool). "Reprocessed wool" identifies "wool which has been woven or felted into
a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without having been
used by the ultimate consumer".[16] "Reused wool" refers to such wool that has
been used by the ultimate consumer.[16]
***** History[edit] *****

wool_trade
A 1905 illustration of a Tibetan man spinning wool
Wild_sheep were more hairy than woolly. Although sheep were domesticated some
9,000 to 11,000 years ago, archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites
in Iran suggests selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 BC,[17]
[18] with the earliest woven wool garments having only been dated to two to
three thousand years later.[19] Woolly sheep were introduced into Europe from
the Near East in the early part of the 4th millennium BC. The oldest known
European wool textile, ca. 1500 BC, was preserved in a Danish_bog.[20] Prior to
invention of shearsâprobably in the Iron_Ageâthe wool was plucked out by
hand or by bronze combs. In Roman times, wool, linen, and leather clothed the
European population; cotton from India was a curiosity of which only
naturalists had heard, and silks, imported along the Silk_Road from China, were
extravagant luxury_goods. Pliny_the_Elder records in his Natural_History that
the reputation for producing the finest wool was enjoyed by Tarentum, where
selective breeding had produced sheep with superior fleeces, but which required
special care.
In medieval times, as trade connections expanded, the Champagne_fairs revolved
around the production of wool cloth in small centers such as Provins. The
network developed by the annual fairs meant the woolens of Provins might find
their way to Naples, Sicily, Cyprus, Majorca, Spain, and even Constantinople.
[21] The wool trade developed into serious business, a generator of capital.
[22] In the 13th century, the wool trade became the economic engine of the Low
Countries and central Italy. By the end of the 14th century, Italy
predominated, though Italian production turned to silk in the 16th century.[21]
Both industries, based on the export of English raw wool, were rivaled only by
the 15th-century sheepwalks of Castile and were a significant source of income
to the English crown, which in 1275 had imposed an export tax on wool called
the "Great Custom". The importance of wool to the English economy can be seen
in the fact that since the 14th century, the presiding officer of the House_of
Lords has sat on the "Woolsack", a chair stuffed with wool.
Economies_of_scale were instituted in the Cistercian houses, which had
accumulated great tracts of land during the 12th and early 13th centuries, when
land prices were low and labor still scarce. Raw wool was baled and shipped
from North_Sea ports to the textile cities of Flanders, notably Ypres and
Ghent, where it was dyed and worked up as cloth. At the time of the Black
Death, English textile industries accounted for about 10% of English wool
production. The English textile trade grew during the 15th century, to the
point where export of wool was discouraged. Over the centuries, various British
laws controlled the wool trade or required the use of wool even in burials. The
smuggling of wool out of the country, known as owling, was at one time
punishable by the cutting off of a hand. After the Restoration, fine English
woolens began to compete with silks in the international market, partly aided
by the Navigation_Acts; in 1699, the English crown forbade its American
colonies to trade wool with anyone but England herself.
A great deal of the value of woolen textiles was in the dyeing and finishing of
the woven product. In each of the centers of the textile trade, the
manufacturing process came to be subdivided into a collection of trades,
overseen by an entrepreneur in a system called by the English the "putting-out"
system, or "cottage industry", and the Verlagssystem by the Germans. In this
system of producing wool cloth, once perpetuated in the production of Harris
tweeds, the entrepreneur provides the raw materials and an advance, the
remainder being paid upon delivery of the product. Written contracts bound the
artisans to specified terms. Fernand_Braudel traces the appearance of the
system in the 13th-century economic boom, quoting a document of 1275.[21] The
system effectively bypassed the guilds' restrictions.
Before the flowering of the Renaissance, the Medici and other great banking
houses of Florence had built their wealth and banking system on their textile
industry based on wool, overseen by the Arte_della_Lana, the wool guild: wool
textile interests guided Florentine policies. Francesco_Datini, the "merchant
of Prato", established in 1383 an Arte della Lana for that small Tuscan city.
The sheepwalks of Castile shaped the landscape and the fortunes of the meseta
that lies in the heart of the Iberian peninsula; in the 16th century, a unified
Spain allowed export of Merino lambs only with royal permission. The German
wool market â based on sheep of Spanish origin â did not overtake British
wool until comparatively late. The Industrial_Revolution introduced mass
production technology into wool and wool cloth manufacturing. Australia's
colonial economy was based on sheep raising, and the Australian wool trade
eventually overtook that of the Germans by 1845, furnishing wool for Bradford,
which developed as the heart of industrialized woolens production.

Due to decreasing demand with increased use of synthetic fibers, wool
production is much less than what it was in the past. The collapse in the price
of wool began in late 1966 with a 40% drop; with occasional interruptions, the
price has tended down. The result has been sharply reduced production and
movement of resources into production of other commodities, in the case of
sheep growers, to production of meat.[23][24][25]
Superwash wool (or washable wool) technology first appeared in the early 1970s
to produce wool that has been specially treated so it is machine washable and
may be tumble-dried. This wool is produced using an acid bath that removes the
"scales" from the fiber, or by coating the fiber with a polymer that prevents
the scales from attaching to each other and causing shrinkage. This process
results in a fiber that holds longevity and durability over synthetic
materials, while retaining its shape.[26]
In December 2004, a bale of the then world's finest wool, averaging 11.8
microns, sold for AU$3,000 per kilogram at auction in Melbourne, Victoria. This
fleece wool tested with an average yield of 74.5%, 68 mm long, and had 40
newtons per kilotex strength. The result was A$279,000 for the bale.[27] The
finest bale of wool ever auctioned was sold for a seasonal record of AU$2690
per kilo during June 2008. This bale was produced by the Hillcreston Pinehill
Partnership and measured 11.6 microns, 72.1% yield, and had a 43 newtons per
kilotex strength measurement. The bale realized $247,480 and was exported to
India.[28]
In 2007, a new wool suit was developed and sold in Japan that can be washed in
the shower, and which dries off ready to wear within hours with no ironing
required. The suit was developed using Australian Merino wool, and it enables
woven products made from wool, such as suits, trousers, and skirts, to be
cleaned using a domestic shower at home.[29]
In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to
be the International_Year_of_Natural_Fibres, so as to raise the profile of wool
and other natural_fibers.
***** Production[edit] *****
Global wool production is about 2 million tonnes per year, of which 60% goes
into apparel. Wool comprises ca 3% of the global textile market, but its value
is higher owing to dying and other modifications of the material.[1] Australia
is a leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep but has been
eclipsed by China in terms of total weight.[30] New Zealand (2016) is the
third-largest producer of wool, and the largest producer of crossbred wool.
Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Drysdale, and Elliotdale produce coarser
fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpets.
In the United States, Texas, New_Mexico, and Colorado have large commercial
sheep flocks and their mainstay is the Rambouillet (or French Merino). Also, a
thriving home-flock contingent of small-scale farmers raise small hobby flocks
of specialty sheep for the hand-spinning market. These small-scale farmers
offer a wide selection of fleece. Global woolclip (total amount of wool shorn)

Organic wool is becoming more and more popular. This wool is very limited in
supply and much of it comes from New Zealand and Australia.[32] It is becoming
easier to find in clothing and other products, but these products often carry a
higher price. Wool is environmentally preferable (as compared to petroleum-
based nylon or polypropylene) as a material for carpets, as well, in particular
when combined with a natural binding and the use of formaldehyde-free glues.
Animal_rights groups have noted issues with the production of wool, such as
mulesing.

Merino wool samples for sale by auction, Newcastle, New_South_Wales
About 85% of wool sold in Australia is sold by open cry auction.[33][citation
needed] "Sale by sample" is a method in which a mechanical claw takes a sample
from each bale in a line or lot of wool. These grab samples are bulked,
objectively measured, and a sample of not less than 4 kg is displayed in a box
for the buyer to examine. The Australian Wool Exchange conducts sales primarily
in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Fremantle. About 80 brokers and agents
work throughout Australia.[citation_needed]

Wool buyers' room at a wool auction, Newcastle, New South Wales
About 7% of Australian wool is sold by private treaty on farms or to local
wool-handling facilities. This option gives wool growers benefit from reduced
transport, warehousing, and selling costs. This method is preferred for small
lots or mixed butts to make savings on reclassing and testing.
About 5% of Australian wool is sold over the internet on an electronic offer
board.[citation_needed] This option gives wool growers the ability to set firm
price targets, reoffer passed-in wool, and offer lots to the market quickly and
efficiently. This method works well for tested lots, as buyers use these
results to make a purchase. About 97% of wool is sold without sample
inspection; however, as of December 2009, 59% of wool listed had been passed in
from auction.[citation_needed] Growers through certain brokers can allocate
their wool to a sale and at what price their wool will be reserved.
Sale by tender can achieve considerable cost savings on wool clips large enough
to make it worthwhile for potential buyers to submit tenders. Some marketing
firms sell wool on a consignment basis, obtaining a fixed percentage as
commission.
Forward selling: Some buyers offer a secure price for forward delivery of wool
based on estimated measurements or the results of previous clips. Prices are
quoted at current market rates and are locked in for the season. Premiums and
discounts are added to cover variations in micron, yield, tensile strength,
etc., which are confirmed by actual test results when available.[citation
needed]
Another method of selling wool includes sales direct to wool_mills.
**** Other countries[edit] ****
The British_Wool_Marketing_Board operates a central marketing system for UK
fleece wool with the aim of achieving the best possible net returns for
farmers.
Less than half of New Zealand's wool is sold at auction, while around 45% of
farmers sell wool directly to private buyers and end-users.[34]
United States sheep producers market wool with private or cooperative wool
warehouses, but wool pools are common in many states. In some cases, wool is
pooled in a local market area, but sold through a wool warehouse. Wool offered
with objective measurement test results is preferred. Imported apparel wool and
carpet wool goes directly to central markets, where it is handled by the large
merchants and manufacturers.[35]
***** Yarn[edit] *****
Woollen yarn
Shoddy or recycled wool is made by cutting or tearing apart existing wool
fabric and respinning the resulting fibers.[36] As this process makes the wool
fibers shorter, the remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original. The
recycled wool may be mixed with raw wool, wool noil, or another fiber such as
cotton to increase the average fiber length. Such yarns are typically used as
weft yarns with a cotton warp. This process was invented in the Heavy_Woollen
District of West_Yorkshire and created a microeconomy in this area for many
years.
Worsted is a strong, long-staple, combed wool yarn with a hard surface.[36]
Woolen is a soft, short-staple, carded wool yarn typically used for knitting.
[36] In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is
frequently combined with a worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.[37]
***** Uses[edit] *****
In addition to clothing, wool has been used for blankets, horse rugs, saddle
cloths, carpeting, insulation and upholstery. Wool felt covers piano hammers,
and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy machinery and stereo
speakers. Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with felt, and Roman legionnaires
used breastplates made of wool felt.
Wool has also been traditionally used to cover cloth_diapers.[38][citation
needed] Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and the interior of
the wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment
suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain
dry. Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable,
and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern
cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern
commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.
Initial studies of woolen underwear have found it prevented heat and sweat
rashes because it more readily absorbs the moisture than other fibers.[39]
Merino wool has been used in baby sleep products such as swaddle baby wrap
blankets and infant_sleeping_bags.
As an animal protein, wool can be used as a soil fertilizer, being a slow-
release source of nitrogen.
Researchers at the Royal_Melbourne_Institute_of_Technology school of fashion
and textiles have discovered a blend of wool and Kevlar, the synthetic fiber
widely used in body armor, was lighter, cheaper and worked better in damp
conditions than Kevlar alone. Kevlar, when used alone, loses about 20% of its
effectiveness when wet, so required an expensive waterproofing process. Wool
increased friction in a vest with 28â30 layers of fabric, to provide the same
level of bullet resistance as 36 layers of Kevlar alone.[40]
***** Events[edit] *****

A buyer of Merino_wool, Ermenegildo_Zegna, has offered awards for Australian
wool producers. In 1963, the first Ermenegildo Zegna Perpetual Trophy was
presented in Tasmania for growers of "Superfine skirted Merino fleece". In
1980, a national award, the Ermenegildo Zegna Trophy for Extrafine Wool
Production, was launched. In 2004, this award became known as the Ermenegildo
Zegna Unprotected Wool Trophy. In 1998, an Ermenegildo Zegna Protected Wool
Trophy was launched for fleece from sheep coated for around nine months of the
year.
In 2002, the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy was launched for wool that
is 13.9 microns or finer. Wool from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and
South Africa may enter, and a winner is named from each country.[41] In April
2008, New Zealand won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy for the first
time with a fleece that measured 10.8 microns. This contest awards the winning
fleece weight with the same weight in gold as a prize, hence the name.
In 2010, an ultrafine, 10-micron fleece, from Windradeen, near Pyramul, New
South Wales, won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum International Trophy.[42]
Since 2000, Loro_Piana has awarded a cup for the world's finest bale of wool
that produces just enough fabric for 50 tailor-made suits. The prize is awarded
to an Australian or New Zealand wool grower who produces the year's finest
bale.[43]
The New_England Merino Field days which display local studs, wool, and sheep
are held during January, in even numbered years around the Walcha,_New_South
Wales district. The Annual Wool Fashion Awards, which showcase the use of
Merino wool by fashion designers, are hosted by the city of Armidale,_New_South
Wales, in March each year. This event encourages young and established fashion
designers to display their talents. During each May, Armidale hosts the annual
New England Wool Expo to display wool fashions, handicrafts, demonstrations,
shearing competitions, yard dog trials, and more.[1]
In July, the annual Australian Sheep and Wool Show is held in Bendigo,
Victoria. This is the largest sheep and wool show in the world, with goats and
alpacas, as well as woolcraft competitions and displays, fleece competitions,
sheepdog trials, shearing, and wool handling. The largest competition in the
world for objectively measured fleeces is the Australian Fleece Competition,
which is held annually at Bendigo. In 2008, 475 entries came from all states of
Australia, with first and second prizes going to the Northern_Tablelands,_New
South_Wales fleeces.[44]
