Polyester is a category of polymers that contain the ester functional_group in
their main chain. As a specific material, it most commonly refers to a type
called polyethylene_terephthalate (PET). Polyesters include naturally occurring
chemicals, such as in the cutin of plant_cuticles, as well as synthetics such
as polybutyrate. Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are biodegradable,
but most synthetic polyesters are not. The material is used extensively in
clothing.
Polyester fibers are sometimes spun together with natural fibers to produce a
cloth with blended properties. Cotton-polyester blends (polycot) can be strong,
wrinkle and tear-resistant, and reduce shrinking. Synthetic_fibers using
polyester have high water, wind and environmental resistance compared to plant-
derived fibers. They are less fire_resistant and can melt when ignited.[1]
Polyester blends have been renamed so as to suggest their similarity or even
superiority to natural fibers (for example, China silk, which is an essentially
deceptive term in the textiles industry for a 100% polyester fiber woven to
resemble the sheen and durability of insect-derived silk).
Liquid crystalline polyesters are among the first industrially used liquid
crystal_polymers. They are used for their mechanical properties and heat-
resistance. These traits are also important in their application as an
abradable seal in jet engines.[2]
Natural polyesters could have played a significant role in the origins_of_life.
Long heterogeneous polyester chains and membraneless structures are known to
easily form in a one-pot reaction without catalyst under simple prebiotic
conditions.[3][4]

***** Types[edit] *****
Depending on the chemical structure, polyester can be a thermoplastic or
thermoset. There are also polyester_resins cured by hardeners; however, the
most common polyesters are thermoplastics.[5] Examples of thermoset polyesters
include some of the Desmophen brand from Bayer. The OH group is reacted with an
Isocyanate functional compound in a 2 component system producing coatings which
may optionally be pigmented. Polyesters as thermoplastics may change shape
after the application of heat. While combustible at high temperatures,
polyesters tend to shrink away from flames and self-extinguish upon ignition.
Polyester fibers have high tenacity and E-modulus as well as low water
absorption and minimal shrinkage in comparison with other industrial fibers.
Unsaturated_polyesters (UPR) are thermosetting resins. They are used in the
liquid state as casting materials, in sheet_molding_compounds, as fiberglass
laminating resins and in non-metallic auto-body fillers. They are also used as
the thermoset_polymer_matrix in pre-pregs. Fiberglass-reinforced unsaturated
polyesters find wide application in bodies of yachts and as body parts of cars.
According to the composition of their main chain, polyesters can be:

Polyesters can also be telechelic oligomers like the polycaprolactone diol
(PCL) and the polyethylene adipate diol (PEA). They are then used as
prepolymers.
***** Uses and applications[edit] *****
Fabrics woven or knitted from polyester thread or yarn are used extensively in
apparel and home furnishings, from shirts and pants to jackets and hats, bed
sheets, blankets, upholstered furniture and computer mouse mats. Industrial
polyester fibers, yarns and ropes are used in car tire reinforcements, fabrics
for conveyor belts, safety belts, coated fabrics and plastic reinforcements
with high-energy absorption. Polyester fiber is used as cushioning and
insulating material in pillows, comforters and upholstery padding. Polyester
fabrics are highly stain-resistantâin fact, the only class of dyes which can
be used to alter the color of polyester fabric are what are known as disperse
dyes.[6]
Polyesters are also used to make bottles, films, tarpaulin, canoes, liquid
crystal_displays, holograms, filters, dielectric film for capacitors, film
insulation for wire and insulating_tapes. Polyesters are widely used as a
finish on high-quality wood products such as guitars, pianos and vehicle/yacht
interiors. Thixotropic properties of spray-applicable polyesters make them
ideal for use on open-grain timbers, as they can quickly fill wood grain, with
a high-build film thickness per coat. Cured polyesters can be sanded and
polished to a high-gloss, durable finish.
***** Industry[edit] *****
**** Basics[edit] ****
Polyester is a synthetic polymer made of purified_terephthalic_acid (PTA) or
its dimethyl ester dimethyl_terephthalate (DMT) and monoethylene_glycol (MEG).
With 18% market share of all plastic materials produced, it ranges third after
polyethylene (33.5%)[citation_needed] and polypropylene (19.5%).
The main raw materials are described as follows:
  Purified terephthalic acid (PTA) CAS-No.: 100-21-0
      Synonym: 1,4 benzenedicarboxylic acid,
      Sum formula: C6H4(COOH)2, mol. weight: 166.13
  Dimethylterephthalate (DMT) CAS-No.: 120-61-6
      Synonym: 1,4 benzenedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester,
      Sum formula: C6H4(COOCH3)2, mol. weight: 194.19
  Mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) CAS No.: 107-21-1
      Synonym: 1,2 ethanediol,
      Sum formula: C2H6O2 , mol. weight: 62.07
To make a polymer of high molecular_weight a catalyst is needed. The most
common catalyst is antimony_trioxide (or antimony tri-acetate):
  Antimony trioxide (ATO) CAS-No.: 1309-64-4
      mol. weight: 291.51,
      Sum formula: Sb2O3
In 2008, about 10,000 tonnes Sb2O3 were used to produce around 49 million
tonnes polyethylene terephthalate.[citation_needed]
Polyester is described as follows:
  Polyethylene terephthalate CAS-No.: 25038-59-9
      Synonyms/abbreviations: polyester, PET, PES,
      Sum formula: H-[C10H8O4]-n=60â120 OH, mol. unit weight: 192.17
There are several reasons for the importance of polyester:
    * The relatively easy accessible raw materials PTA or DMT and MEG
    * The very well understood and described simple chemical process of
      polyester synthesis
    * The low toxicity level of all raw materials and side products during
      polyester production and processing
    * The possibility to produce PET in a closed loop at low emissions to the
      environment
    * The outstanding mechanical and chemical properties of polyester
    * The recyclability
    * The wide variety of intermediate and final products made of polyester.
In the following table, the estimated world polyester production is shown. Main
applications are textile polyester, bottle polyester resin, film polyester
mainly for packaging and specialty polyesters for engineering plastics.
According to this table, the world's total polyester production might exceed 50
million tons per annum before the year 2010.

**** Raw material producer[edit] ****
The raw materials PTA, DMT, and MEG are mainly produced by large chemical
companies which are sometimes integrated down to the crude oil refinery where
p-Xylene is the base material to produce PTA and liquefied_petroleum_gas (LPG)
is the base material to produce MEG.[citation_needed]
**** Polyester processing[edit] ****
After the first stage of polymer production in the melt phase, the product
stream divides into two different application areas which are mainly textile
applications and packaging applications. In the following table, the main
applications of textile and packaging of polyester are listed.

A comparable small market segment (much less than 1 million tonnes/year) of
polyester is used to produce engineering plastics and masterbatch.
In order to produce the polyester melt with a high efficiency, high-output
processing steps like staple fiber (50â300 tonnes/day per spinning line) or
POY /FDY (up to 600 tonnes/day split into about 10 spinning machines) are
meanwhile more and more vertically integrated direct processes. This means the
polymer melt is directly converted into the textile fibers or filaments without
the common step of pelletizing. We are talking about full vertical_integration
when polyester is produced at one site starting from crude oil or distillation
products in the chain oil â benzene â PX â PTA â PET melt â fiber/
filament or bottle-grade resin. Such integrated processes are meanwhile
established in more or less interrupted processes at one production site.
Eastman Chemicals were the first to introduce the idea of closing the chain
from PX to PET resin with their so-called INTEGREX process. The capacity of
such vertically integrated production sites is >1000 tonnes/day and can easily
reach 2500 tonnes/day.
Besides the above-mentioned large processing units to produce staple fiber or
yarns, there are ten thousands of small and very small processing plants, so
that one can estimate that polyester is processed and recycled in more than 10
000 plants around the globe. This is without counting all the companies
involved in the supply industry, beginning with engineering and processing
machines and ending with special additives, stabilizers and colors. This is a
gigantic industry complex and it is still growing by 4â8% per year, depending
on the world region.
***** Synthesis[edit] *****
Synthesis of polyesters is generally achieved by a polycondensation reaction.
See "condensation_reactions in polymer chemistry". The general equation for the
reaction of a diol with a diacid is :
      (n+1) R(OH)2 + n RÂ´(COOH)2 â HO[ROOCRÂ´COO]nROH + 2n H2O
**** Azeotrope esterification[edit] ****
In this classical method, an alcohol and a carboxylic_acid react to form a
carboxylic ester. To assemble a polymer, the water formed by the reaction must
be continually removed by azeotrope distillation.
**** Alcoholic transesterification[edit] ****
Main article: Transesterification
Transesterification: An alcohol-terminated oligomer and an ester-terminated
oligomer condense to form an ester linkage, with loss of an alcohol. R and R'
are the two oligomer chains, R'' is a sacrificial unit such as a methyl_group
(methanol is the byproduct of the esterification reaction).
**** Acylation (HCl method)[edit] ****
The acid begins as an acid chloride, and thus the polycondensation proceeds
with emission of hydrochloric_acid (HCl) instead of water. This method can be
carried out in solution or as an enamel.
      Silyl method
      In this variant of the HCl method, the carboxylic acid chloride is
      converted with the trimethyl silyl ether of the alcohol component and
      production of trimethyl silyl chloride is obtained
**** Acetate method (esterification)[edit] ****
      Silyl acetate method
**** Ring-opening polymerization[edit] ****
Aliphatic polyesters can be assembled from lactones under very mild conditions,
catalyzed anionically, cationically or metallorganically. A number of catalytic
methods for the copolymerization of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides have also
recently been shown to provide a wide array of functionalized polyesters, both
saturated and unsaturated.
***** History[edit] *****
In 1926, United States-based E.I._du_Pont_de_Nemours_and_Co. began research on
large molecules and synthetic fibers. This early research, headed by W.H.
Carothers, centered on what became nylon, which was the first synthetic fiber.
[7] Carothers was working for duPont at the time. Carotherâs research was
incomplete and had not advanced to investigating the polyester formed from
mixing ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. The project was revived by
British scientists Whinfield and Dickson, who patented polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) or PETE in 1941. Polyethylene terephthalate forms the basis
for synthetic fibers like Dacron, Terylene and polyester. In 1946, duPont
bought all legal rights from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).[8]
***** Biodegradation[edit] *****
Main article: Biodegradation
The futuro house was made of fibreglass-reinforced polyester plastic;
polyester-polyurethane, and poly(methylmethacrylate) one of them was found to
be degrading by Cyanobacteria and Archaea.[9][10]
**** Cross-linking[edit] ****
Unsaturated polyesters are thermosetting resins. They are generally copolymers
prepared by polymerizing one or more diol with saturated and unsaturated
dicarboxylic acids (maleic_acid, fumaric_acid...) or their anhydrides. The
double bond of unsaturated polyesters reacts with a vinyl monomer, usually
styrene, resulting in a 3-D cross-linked structure. This structure acts as a
thermoset. The exothermic cross-linking reaction is initiated through a
catalyst, usually an organic_peroxide such as methyl_ethyl_ketone_peroxide or
benzoyl_peroxide.
***** Environmental concerns[edit] *****
**** Pollution of freshwater and seawater habitats[edit] ****
A team at Plymouth University in the UK spent 12 months analysing what happened
when a number of synthetic materials were washed at different temperatures in
domestic washing machines, using different combinations of detergents, to
quantify the microfibres shed. They found that an average washing load of 6 kg
could release an estimated 137,951 fibres from polyester-cotton blend fabric,
496,030 fibres from polyester and 728,789 from acrylic. Those fibers add to the
general microplastics pollution.[11][12][13]
**** Non-renewable[edit] ****
Polyester is a synthetic petroleum-based fibre, and is therefore a non-
renewable carbon-intensive resource.[14] Nearly 70 million barrels of oil are
used each year to make polyester around the world, which is now the most
commonly used fiber in making clothes. But it takes more than 200 years to
decompose.[15]
