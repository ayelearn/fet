Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the mechanics of fluids
(liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them. It has applications in a
wide range of disciplines, including mechanical, civil, chemical and biomedical
engineering, geophysics, oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, and biology.
Fluid Mechanics can also be defined as the science which deals with the study
of behaviour of fluids either at rest or in motion.
It can be divided into fluid_statics, the study of fluids at rest; and fluid
dynamics, the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion. It is a branch of
continuum_mechanics, a subject which models matter without using the
information that it is made out of atoms; that is, it models matter from a
macroscopic viewpoint rather than from microscopic. Fluid mechanics, especially
fluid dynamics, is an active field of research, typically mathematically
complex. Many problems are partly or wholly unsolved, and are best addressed by
numerical_methods, typically using computers. A modern discipline, called
computational_fluid_dynamics (CFD), is devoted to this approach. Particle_image
velocimetry, an experimental method for visualizing and analyzing fluid flow,
also takes advantage of the highly visual nature of fluid flow.

***** Brief history[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_fluid_mechanics
The study of fluid mechanics goes back at least to the days of ancient_Greece,
when Archimedes investigated fluid statics and buoyancy and formulated his
famous law known now as the Archimedes'_principle, which was published in his
work On_Floating_Bodiesâgenerally considered to be the first major work on
fluid mechanics. Rapid advancement in fluid mechanics began with Leonardo_da
Vinci (observations and experiments), Evangelista_Torricelli (invented the
barometer), Isaac_Newton (investigated viscosity) and Blaise_Pascal (researched
hydrostatics, formulated Pascal's_law), and was continued by Daniel_Bernoulli
with the introduction of mathematical fluid dynamics in Hydrodynamica (1739).
Inviscid flow was further analyzed by various mathematicians Jean_le_Rond
d'Alembert, Joseph_Louis_Lagrange, Pierre-Simon_Laplace, SimÃ©on_Denis_Poisson)
and viscous flow was explored by a multitude of engineers including Jean
LÃ©onard_Marie_Poiseuille and Gotthilf_Hagen. Further mathematical
justification was provided by Claude-Louis_Navier and George_Gabriel_Stokes in
the NavierâStokes_equations, and boundary_layers were investigated (Ludwig
Prandtl, Theodore_von_KÃ¡rmÃ¡n), while various scientists such as Osborne
Reynolds, Andrey_Kolmogorov, and Geoffrey_Ingram_Taylor advanced the
understanding of fluid viscosity and turbulence.
***** Main branches[edit] *****
**** Fluid statics[edit] ****
Main article: Fluid_statics
Fluid_statics or hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies
fluids at rest. It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are
at rest in stable equilibrium; and is contrasted with fluid_dynamics, the study
of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many
phenomena of everyday life, such as why atmospheric_pressure changes with
altitude, why wood and oil float on water, and why the surface of water is
always level whatever the shape of its container. Hydrostatics is fundamental
to hydraulics, the engineering of equipment for storing, transporting and using
fluids. It is also relevant to some aspects of geophysics and astrophysics (for
example, in understanding plate_tectonics and anomalies in the Earth's
gravitational_field), to meteorology, to medicine (in the context of blood
pressure), and many other fields.
**** Fluid dynamics[edit] ****
Main article: Fluid_dynamics
Fluid_dynamics is a subdiscipline of fluid mechanics that deals with fluid
flowâthe science of liquids and gases in motion. Fluid dynamics offers a
systematic structureâwhich underlies these practical_disciplinesâthat
embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow_measurement and
used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem
typically involves calculating various properties of the fluid, such as
velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, as functions of space and time.
It has several subdisciplines itself, including aerodynamics (the study of air
and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in motion).
Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces
and movements on aircraft, determining the mass_flow_rate of petroleum through
pipelines, predicting evolving weather patterns, understanding nebulae in
interstellar_space and modeling explosions. Some fluid-dynamical principles are
used in traffic_engineering and crowd dynamics.
***** Relationship to continuum mechanics[edit] *****
Fluid mechanics is a subdiscipline of continuum_mechanics, as illustrated in
the following table.

In a mechanical view, a fluid is a substance that does not support shear
stress; that is why a fluid at rest has the shape of its containing vessel. A
fluid at rest has no shear stress.
***** Assumptions[edit] *****
Balance for some integrated fluid quantity in a control_volume enclosed by a
control_surface.
The assumptions inherent to a fluid mechanical treatment of a physical system
can be expressed in terms of mathematical equations. Fundamentally, every fluid
mechanical system is assumed to obey:
    * Conservation_of_mass
    * Conservation_of_energy
    * Conservation_of_momentum
    * The continuum assumption
For example, the assumption that mass is conserved means that for any fixed
control_volume (for example, a spherical volume)âenclosed by a control
surfaceâthe rate_of_change of the mass contained in that volume is equal to
the rate at which mass is passing through the surface from outside to inside,
minus the rate at which mass is passing from inside to outside. This can be
expressed as an equation_in_integral_form over the control volume.[1]
The continuum assumption is an idealization of continuum_mechanics under which
fluids can be treated as continuous, even though, on a microscopic scale, they
are composed of molecules. Under the continuum assumption, macroscopic
(observed/measurable) properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and
bulk velocity are taken to be well-defined at "infinitesimal" volume
elementsâsmall in comparison to the characteristic length scale of the
system, but large in comparison to molecular length scale. Fluid properties can
vary continuously from one volume element to another and are average values of
the molecular properties. The continuum hypothesis can lead to inaccurate
results in applications like supersonic speed flows, or molecular flows on nano
scale. Those problems for which the continuum hypothesis fails, can be solved
using statistical_mechanics. To determine whether or not the continuum
hypothesis applies, the Knudsen_number, defined as the ratio of the molecular
mean_free_path to the characteristic length scale, is evaluated. Problems with
Knudsen numbers below 0.1 can be evaluated using the continuum hypothesis, but
molecular approach (statistical mechanics) can be applied for all ranges of
Knudsen numbers.
***** NavierâStokes equations[edit] *****
Main article: NavierâStokes_equations
The NavierâStokes equations (named after Claude-Louis_Navier and George
Gabriel_Stokes) are differential_equations that describe the force balance at a
given point within a fluid. For an incompressible_fluid with vector velocity
field      u    {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }  [\mathbf {u} ], the
NavierâStokes equations are
            &#x2202;  u    &#x2202; t    + (  u  &#x22C5; &#x2207; )  u  =
      &#x2212;   1 &#x03C1;   &#x2207; P + &#x03BD;  &#x2207;  2    u
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {u}
      \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla P+\nu \nabla ^
      {2}\mathbf {u} }  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial
      t}}+(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla
      P+\nu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} }].
These differential equations are the analogues for deformable materials to
Newton's equations of motion for particles â the NavierâStokes equations
describe changes in momentum (force) in response to pressure     P
{\displaystyle P}  [P] and viscosity, parameterized by the kinematic_viscosity
&#x03BD;   {\displaystyle \nu }  [\nu ] here. Occasionally, body_forces, such
as the gravitational force or Lorentz force are added to the equations.
Solutions of the NavierâStokes equations for a given physical problem must be
sought with the help of calculus. In practical terms only the simplest cases
can be solved exactly in this way. These cases generally involve non-turbulent,
steady flow in which the Reynolds_number is small. For more complex cases,
especially those involving turbulence, such as global weather systems,
aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and many more, solutions of the NavierâStokes
equations can currently only be found with the help of computers. This branch
of science is called computational_fluid_dynamics.
***** Inviscid and viscous fluids[edit] *****
An inviscid fluid has no viscosity,     &#x03BD; = 0   {\displaystyle \nu =0}
[{\displaystyle \nu =0}]. In practice, an inviscid flow is an idealization, one
that facilitates mathematical treatment. In fact, purely inviscid flows are
only known to be realized in the case of superfluidity. Otherwise, fluids are
generally viscous, a property that is often most important within a boundary
layer near a solid surface,[2] where the flow must match onto the no-slip
condition at the solid. In some cases, the mathematics of a fluid mechanical
system can be treated by assuming that the fluid outside of boundary layers is
inviscid, and then matching its solution onto that for a thin laminar boundary
layer.
For fluid flow over a porous boundary, the fluid velocity can be discontinuous
between the free fluid and the fluid in the porous media (this is related to
the Beavers and Joseph condition). Further, it is useful at low subsonic speeds
to assume that a gas is incompressibleâthat is, the density of the gas does
not change even though the speed and static_pressure change.
***** Newtonian versus non-Newtonian fluids[edit] *****
A Newtonian fluid (named after Isaac_Newton) is defined to be a fluid whose
shear_stress is linearly proportional to the velocity gradient in the direction
perpendicular to the plane of shear. This definition means regardless of the
forces acting on a fluid, it continues to flow. For example, water is a
Newtonian fluid, because it continues to display fluid properties no matter how
much it is stirred or mixed. A slightly less rigorous definition is that the
drag of a small object being moved slowly through the fluid is proportional to
the force applied to the object. (Compare friction). Important fluids, like
water as well as most gases, behaveâto good approximationâas a Newtonian
fluid under normal conditions on Earth.[3]
By contrast, stirring a non-Newtonian_fluid can leave a "hole" behind. This
will gradually fill up over timeâthis behaviour is seen in materials such as
pudding, oobleck, or sand (although sand isn't strictly a fluid).
Alternatively, stirring a non-Newtonian fluid can cause the viscosity to
decrease, so the fluid appears "thinner" (this is seen in non-drip paints).
There are many types of non-Newtonian fluids, as they are defined to be
something that fails to obey a particular propertyâfor example, most fluids
with long molecular chains can react in a non-Newtonian manner.[3]
**** Equations for a Newtonian fluid[edit] ****
Main article: Newtonian_fluid
The constant of proportionality between the viscous stress tensor and the
velocity gradient is known as the viscosity. A simple equation to describe
incompressible Newtonian fluid behaviour is
         &#x03C4; = &#x2212; &#x03BC;    d v   d y      {\displaystyle \tau =-
      \mu {\frac {dv}{dy}}}  [\tau =-\mu {\frac {dv}{dy}}]
where
         &#x03C4;   {\displaystyle \tau }  [\tau ] is the shear stress exerted
      by the fluid ("drag")
         &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] is the fluid viscosityâa
      constant of proportionality
            d v   d y      {\displaystyle {\frac {dv}{dy}}}  [{\frac {dv}{dy}}]
      is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of shear.
For a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity, by definition, depends only on
temperature and pressure, not on the forces acting upon it. If the fluid is
incompressible the equation governing the viscous stress (in Cartesian
coordinates) is
          &#x03C4;  i j   = &#x03BC;  (     &#x2202;  v  i     &#x2202;  x  j
      +    &#x2202;  v  j     &#x2202;  x  i       )    {\displaystyle \tau _
      {ij}=\mu \left({\frac {\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial
      v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}\right)}  [\tau _{ij}=\mu \left({\frac {\partial
      v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}\right)]
where
          &#x03C4;  i j     {\displaystyle \tau _{ij}}  [\tau _{ij}] is the
      shear stress on the      i  t h     {\displaystyle i^{th}}  [i^{th}] face
      of a fluid element in the      j  t h     {\displaystyle j^{th}}  [j^
      {th}] direction
          v  i     {\displaystyle v_{i}}  [v_{i}] is the velocity in the      i
      t h     {\displaystyle i^{th}}  [i^{th}] direction
          x  j     {\displaystyle x_{j}}  [x_{j}] is the      j  t h
      {\displaystyle j^{th}}  [j^{th}] direction coordinate.
If the fluid is not incompressible the general form for the viscous stress in a
Newtonian fluid is
          &#x03C4;  i j   = &#x03BC;  (     &#x2202;  v  i     &#x2202;  x  j
      +    &#x2202;  v  j     &#x2202;  x  i      &#x2212;   2 3    &#x03B4;  i
      j   &#x2207; &#x22C5;  v   )  + &#x03BA;  &#x03B4;  i j   &#x2207;
      &#x22C5;  v    {\displaystyle \tau _{ij}=\mu \left({\frac {\partial v_
      {i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}-{\frac {2}
      {3}}\delta _{ij}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} \right)+\kappa \delta _
      {ij}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} }  [\tau _{ij}=\mu \left({\frac {\partial v_
      {i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}-{\frac {2}
      {3}}\delta _{ij}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} \right)+\kappa \delta _
      {ij}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} ]
where     &#x03BA;   {\displaystyle \kappa }  [\kappa ] is the second viscosity
coefficient (or bulk viscosity). If a fluid does not obey this relation, it is
termed a non-Newtonian_fluid, of which there are several types. Non-Newtonian
fluids can be either plastic, Bingham plastic, pseudoplastic, dilatant,
thixotropic, rheopectic, viscoelastic.
In some applications another rough broad division among fluids is made: ideal
and non-ideal fluids. An Ideal fluid is non-viscous and offers no resistance
whatsoever to a shearing force. An ideal fluid really does not exist, but in
some calculations, the assumption is justifiable. One example of this is the
flow far from solid surfaces. In many cases the viscous effects are
concentrated near the solid boundaries (such as in boundary layers) while in
regions of the flow field far away from the boundaries the viscous effects can
be neglected and the fluid there is treated as it were inviscid (ideal flow).
When the viscosity is neglected, the term containing the viscous stress tensor
&#x03C4;    {\displaystyle \mathbf {\tau } }  [\mathbf {\tau } ] in the
NavierâStokes equation vanishes. The equation reduced in this form is called
the Euler_equation.
