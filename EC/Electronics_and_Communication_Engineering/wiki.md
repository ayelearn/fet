Electronic engineering (also called electronics and communications engineering)
is an electrical_engineering discipline which utilizes nonlinear and active
electrical components (such as semiconductor_devices, especially transistors,
diodes and integrated_circuits) to design electronic_circuits, devices, VLSI
devices and their systems. The discipline typically also designs passive
electrical components, usually based on printed_circuit_boards.
Electronics is a subfield within the wider electrical_engineering academic
subject but denotes a broad engineering field that covers subfields such as
analog_electronics, digital_electronics, consumer_electronics, embedded_systems
and power_electronics. Electronics engineering deals with implementation of
applications, principles and algorithms developed within many related fields,
for example solid-state_physics, radio_engineering, telecommunications, control
systems, signal_processing, systems_engineering, computer_engineering,
instrumentation_engineering, electric_power_control, robotics, and many others.
The Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers (IEEE) is one of the most
important and influential organizations for electronics engineers based in the
US. On an international level, the International_Electrotechnical_Commission
(IEC) prepares standards for electronic engineering, developed through
consensus and thanks to the work of 20,000 experts from 172 countries
worldwide.

***** Relationship to electrical engineering[edit] *****
Electronics is a subfield within the wider electrical_engineering academic
subject. An academic degree with a major in electronics engineering can be
acquired from some universities, while other universities use electrical
engineering as the subject. The term electrical_engineer is still used in the
academic world to include electronic engineers.[1] However, some people
consider the term 'electrical engineer' should be reserved for those having
specialized in power and heavy current or high voltage engineering, while
others consider that power is just one subset of electrical engineering, as
well as 'electrical_distribution engineering'. The term 'power_engineering' is
used as a descriptor in that industry. Again, in recent years there has been a
growth of new separate-entry degree courses such as 'systems_engineering' and
'communication_systems_engineering', often followed by academic departments of
similar name, which are typically not considered as subfields of electronics
engineering but of electrical engineering.[2][3]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_electronic_engineering
Electronic engineering as a profession sprang from technological improvements
in the telegraph industry in the late 19th century and the radio and the
telephone industries in the early 20th century. People were attracted to radio
by the technical fascination it inspired, first in receiving and then in
transmitting. Many who went into broadcasting in the 1920s were only 'amateurs'
in the period before World_War_I.[4]
To a large extent, the modern discipline of electronic engineering was born out
of telephone, radio, and television equipment development and the large amount
of electronic systems development during World_War_II of radar, sonar,
communication systems, and advanced munitions and weapon systems. In the
interwar years, the subject was known as radio_engineering and it was only in
the late 1950s that the term electronic engineering started to emerge.[5]
***** Electronics[edit] *****
Main article: Electronics
In the field of electronic engineering, engineers design and test circuits that
use the electromagnetic properties of electrical_components such as resistors,
capacitors, inductors, diodes and transistors to achieve a particular
functionality. The tuner_circuit, which allows the user of a radio to filter
out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit.
In designing an integrated circuit, electronics engineers first construct
circuit schematics that specify the electrical components and describe the
interconnections between them. When completed, VLSI engineers convert the
schematics into actual layouts, which map the layers of various conductor and
semiconductor materials needed to construct the circuit. The conversion from
schematics to layouts can be done by software (see electronic_design
automation) but very often requires human fine-tuning to decrease space and
power consumption. Once the layout is complete, it can be sent to a fabrication
plant for manufacturing.
For systems of intermediate complexity, engineers may use VHDL modeling for
programmable_logic_devices and FPGAs.
Integrated_circuits, FPGAs and other electrical components can then be
assembled on printed_circuit_boards to form more complicated circuits. Today,
printed circuit boards are found in most electronic devices including
televisions, computers and audio_players.[6]
***** Subfields[edit] *****
 This section duplicates the scope of other sections, specifically, Electrical
 engineering#Subfields. (February 2019)
Electronic engineering has many subfields. This section describes some of the
most popular subfields in electronic engineering; although there are engineers
who focus exclusively on one subfield, there are also many who focus on a
combination of subfields.
Signal processing deals with the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals
can be either analog, in which case the signal varies continuously according to
the information, or digital, in which case the signal varies according to a
series of discrete values representing the information.
For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and
filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and
demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal
processing may involve the compression, error_checking and error_detection of
digital signals.
Telecommunications engineering deals with the transmission of information
across a channel such as a co-axial_cable, optical_fiber or free_space.
Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier
wave in order to shift the information to a carrier_frequency suitable for
transmission, this is known as modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques
include amplitude_modulation and frequency_modulation. The choice of modulation
affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be
balanced carefully by the engineer.
Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined,
telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for
such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication
device known as a transceiver. A key consideration in the design of
transmitters is their power_consumption as this is closely related to their
signal_strength. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the
signal's information will be corrupted by noise.
Electromagnetics is an in-depth study about the signals that are transmitted in
a channel (Wired or Wireless). This includes Basics of Electromagnetic waves,
Transmission Lines and Waveguides, Antennas, its types and applications with
Radio-Frequency (RF) and Microwaves. Its applications are seen widely in other
sub-fields like Telecommunication, Control and Instrumentation Engineering.
Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and
propulsion systems of commercial_airplanes to the cruise_control present in
many modern cars. It also plays an important role in industrial_automation.
Control engineers often utilize feedback when designing control_systems. For
example, in a car with cruise_control, the vehicle's speed is continuously
monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the engine's power output
accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, control_theory can be used to
determine how the system responds to such feedback.
Instrumentation engineering deals with the design of devices to measure
physical quantities such as pressure, flow and temperature. These devices are
known as instrumentation.
The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of physics
that often extends beyond electromagnetic_theory. For example, radar_guns use
the Doppler_effect to measure the speed of oncoming vehicles. Similarly,
thermocouples use the PeltierâSeebeck_effect to measure the temperature
difference between two points.
Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the sensors of
larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help
ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason,
instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control
engineering.
Computer engineering deals with the design of computers and computer systems.
This may involve the design of new computer_hardware, the design of PDAs or the
use of computers to control an industrial_plant. Development of embedded
systemsâsystems made for specific tasks (e.g., mobile phones)âis also
included in this field. This field includes the micro_controller and its
applications. Computer engineers may also work on a system's software. However,
the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software
engineering, which is usually considered a separate discipline.
VLSI design engineering VLSI stands for very large scale integration. It deals
with fabrication of ICs and various electronic components.
***** Education and training[edit] *****
Main article: Education_and_training_of_electrical_and_electronics_engineers
Electronics engineers typically possess an academic_degree with a major in
electronic engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three
or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor_of
Engineering, Bachelor_of_Science, Bachelor_of_Applied_Science, or Bachelor_of
Technology depending upon the university. Many UK universities also offer
Master_of_Engineering (MEng) degrees at the graduate level.
Some electronics engineers also choose to pursue a postgraduate degree such as
a Master_of_Science, Doctor_of_Philosophy in Engineering, or an Engineering
Doctorate. The master's degree is being introduced in some European and
American Universities as a first degree and the differentiation of an engineer
with graduate and postgraduate studies is often difficult. In these cases,
experience is taken into account. The master's degree may consist of either
research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy consists
of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to
academia.
In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step
towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a
professional body. Certification allows engineers to legally sign off on plans
for projects affecting public safety.[7] After completing a certified degree
program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements, including work
experience requirements, before being certified. Once certified the engineer is
designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada,
and South Africa), Chartered_Engineer or Incorporated_Engineer (in the United
Kingdom, Ireland, India, and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in
Australia and New Zealand) or European_Engineer (in much of the European
Union).
A degree in electronics generally includes units covering physics, chemistry,
mathematics, project_management and specific topics in electrical_engineering.
Initially, such topics cover most, if not all, of the subfields of electronic
engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subfields
towards the end of the degree.
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as
these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how
such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of
computers and it is commonplace to use computer-aided_design and simulation
software programs when designing electronic systems. Although most electronic
engineers will understand basic circuit theory, the theories employed by
engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum
mechanics and solid_state_physics might be relevant to an engineer working on
VLSI but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with embedded_systems.
Apart from electromagnetics and network theory, other items in the syllabus are
particular to electronics engineering course. Electrical engineering courses
have other specialisms such as machines, power_generation and distribution.

IET). Members of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (MIET) are
recognized professionally in Europe, as Electrical and computer (technology)
engineers. The IEEE claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature in
electrical/electronic engineering, has over 430,000 members, and holds more
than 450 IEEE sponsored or cosponsored conferences worldwide each year. SMIEEE
is a recognised professional_designation in the United States.
***** Project engineering[edit] *****
For most engineers not involved at the cutting edge of system design and
development, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A
lot of time is also spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients,
preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers
manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason, project
management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of
documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very
important.
The workplaces of electronics engineers are just as varied as the types of work
they do. Electronics engineers may be found in the pristine laboratory
environment of a fabrication plant, the offices of a consulting firm or in a
research laboratory. During their working life, electronics engineers may find
themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists,
electricians, computer programmers and other engineers.
Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electronics
engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews
of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore
essential to maintaining proficiency. And these are mostly used in the field of
consumer electronics products.[25]
