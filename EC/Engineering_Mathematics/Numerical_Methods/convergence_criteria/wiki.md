The euro convergence criteria (also known as the Maastricht criteria) are the
criteria which European_Union member states are required to meet to enter the
third stage of the Economic_and_Monetary_Union (EMU) and adopt the euro as
their currency. The four main criteria, which actually comprise five criteria
as the "fiscal criterion" consists of both a "debt criterion" and a "deficit
criterion", are based on Article_140 (ex article 121.1) of the Treaty_on_the
Functioning_of_the_European_Union.
Full EMU membership is only open to EU_member_states. However, the European
microstates of Andorra, Monaco, San_Marino and the Vatican_City, which due to
their small size are not members of the EU[citation_needed], have signed
monetary_agreements_with_EU which allow them officially to adopt the euro and
issue their own variant of euro_coins. These states had all previously used one
of the eurozone currencies replaced by the euro, or a currency pegged to one of
them. These states are not members of the eurozone and do not get a seat in the
European_Central_Bank (ECB) or the Eurogroup.
As part of the EU treaty, all of the EU Member States are obliged to adhere to
the Stability_and_Growth_Pact (SGP), which serves as a framework to ensure
price_stability and fiscal_responsibility, has adopted identical limits for
governments budget deficit and debt as the convergence criteria. Due to the
fact that several countries did not exercise a sufficient level of fiscal
responsibility during the first 10 years of the euro's lifetime, two major SGP
reforms were recently introduced. The first reform was the Sixpack which
entered into force in December 2011, and it was followed in January 2013 by the
even more ambitious Fiscal_Compact, which was signed by 25 out of the then-27
EU member states.

***** Criteria[edit] *****
The Maastricht_Treaty, which was signed in February 1992 and entered into force
on 1 November 1993, outlined the 5 convergence criteria EU member states are
required to comply with to adopt the new currency the euro. The purpose of
setting the criteria was to achieve price stability within the eurozone and
ensure it wasn't negatively impacted when new member states accede. The
framework of the five criteria was outlined by article_109j.1 of the Maastricht
Treaty, and the attached Protocol_on_the_Convergence_Criteria and Protocol_on
the_Excessive_Deficit_Procedure. The original treaty article was later
renumbered to become article 121.1 of the Amsterdam_Treaty,[1] and later
renumbered again to Article_140 of the Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the
European_Union. Aside from the renumbering, no significant change have happened
to the content of the "convergence criteria article" and its referred to
Protocol_on_the_Convergence_Criteria and Protocol_on_the_Excessive_Deficit
Procedure. The precise definition and method of measuring compliance was
subsequently further developed by the EMI (later known as ECB) in their first
three reports published in April 1995, November 1995 and November 1996.[2][3]
[4] The full definition of the five criteria are summarised below.
   1. HICP_inflation (12-months average of yearly rates): Shall not exceed the
      HICP reference value, which is calculated by the end of the last month
      with available data as the unweighted arithmetic average of the similar
      HICP inflation rates in the 3 EU member states with the lowest HICP
      inflation plus 1.5 percentage points. However, EU member states with a
      HICP rate significantly below the eurozone average (and pre 1999 below
      "comparable rates in other Member States"), do not qualify as a benchmark
      country for the reference value and will be ignored, if it can be
      established its price developments have been strongly affected by
      exceptional factors (i.e. severe enforced wage cuts, exceptional
      developments in energy/food/currency markets, or a strong recession).[5]
      In example, at the April 2014 assessment: Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus
      with HICP values respectively 2.2, 1.8 and 1.4 percentage points below
      the eurozone average, were all found to have suffered from exceptional
      factors, and hence concluded to be outliers, causing the reference limit
      instead to be calculated based on the HICP values from the three states
      with the 4th to 6th lowest HICP values in EU.[6]
   2. Government_budget_deficit: The ratio of the annual general government
      deficit relative to gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices, must
      not exceed 3% at the end of the preceding fiscal year (based on notified
      measured data) and neither for any of the two subsequent years (based on
      the European_Commission's published forecast data). Deficits being
      "slightly above the limit" (previously outlined by the evaluation
      practice to mean deficits in the range from 3.0â3.5%[7]), will as a
      standard rule not be accepted, unless it can be established that either:
      "1) The deficit ratio has declined substantially and continuously before
      reaching the level close to the 3% limit" or "2) The small deficit ratio
      excess above the 3% limit has been caused by exceptional circumstances
      and has a temporary nature (i.e. expenditure one-offs triggered by a
      significant economic downturn, or expenditure one-offs triggered by the
      implementation of economic reforms with a positive mid/long-term
      effect)".[2][3][8] If a state is found by the Commission to have breached
      the deficit criteria, they will recommend the Council_of_the_European
      Union to open up a deficit-breached EDP against the state in accordance
      with Article_126(6), which only will be abrogated again when the state
      simultaneously comply with both the deficit and debt criteria.
   3. Government debt-to-GDP_ratio: The ratio of gross government_debt
      (measured at its nominal value outstanding at the end of the year, and
      consolidated between and within the sectors of general government)
      relative to GDP at market prices, must not exceed 60% at the end of the
      preceding fiscal year. Or if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the 60% limit,
      the ratio shall at least be found to have "sufficiently diminished and
      must be approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace".[3] This
      "satisfactory pace" was defined and operationalized by a specific
      calculation formula, with the entry into force of the new_debt_reduction
      benchmark_rule in December 2011, requiring the states in breach of the
      60% limit to deliver â either for the backward- or forward-looking 3-
      year period â an annual debt-to-GDP ratio reduction of at least 5% of
      the part of the benchmark value being in excess of the 60% limit. If both
      the 60% limit and "debt reduction benchmark rule" is breached, the
      Commission will finally check if the breach has been caused only by
      certain special exempted causes (i.e. capital payments to establishment
      of common financial stability mechanisms, like the ESM) â because if
      this is the case they will then rule an "exempted compliance". If a state
      is found by the Commission to have breached the debt criteria (without
      this breach solely being due to "exempted causes"), they will recommend
      the Council of the European Union to open up a debt-breached EDP against
      the state in accordance with Article_126(6), which only will be abrogated
      again when the state simultaneously comply with both the deficit and debt
      criteria.[8]
   4. Exchange rate stability: Applicant countries should not have devalued the
      central rate of their euro pegged currency during the previous two years,
      and for the same period the currency stability shall be deemed to have
      been stable without "severe tensions". As a third requirement,
      participation in the exchange-rate_mechanism (ERM / ERM II) under the
      European_Monetary_System (EMS) for two consecutive years is expected,[9]
      though according to the Commission "exchange rate stability during a
      period of non-participation before entering ERM II can be taken into
      account."[10] For example, Italy was deemed to have converged with only
      15 months as an ERM-member, as measured on the last day in the review
      period of the convergence report.[11] Meanwhile, the European Commission
      concluded that for Cyprus, Malta and Latvia, their 18 months of
      membership in the review period ending on 31 October 2006 was
      insufficient.[12] As of 2014, all 29 times the subcriteria for ERM-
      membership length was found complied with by the Commission, these cases
      had the particular observation in common, that the state had surpassed
      minimum two full years of ERM-membership either ahead of the "final
      approval date (following approximately 1.5 month after the publication of
      the convergence report) where their currency exchange rate would be
      irrevocably fixed by the Council of the European Union" or by the "first
      possible euro adoption date following the publication of the convergence
      report".
   5. Long-term interest rates (average yields for 10yr government bonds in the
      past year): Shall be no more than 2.0 percentage points higher, than the
      unweighted arithmetic average of the similar 10-year government bond
      yields in the 3 EU member states with the lowest HICP inflation (having
      qualified as benchmark countries for the calculation of the HICP
      reference value). If any of the 3 EU member states in concern are
      suffering from interest rates significantly higher than the "GDP-weighted
      eurozone average interest rate", and at the same time by the end of the
      assessment period have no complete funding access to the financial
      lending markets (which will be the case for as long as a country is
      unable to issue new government bonds with 10-year maturity â instead
      being dependent on disbursements from a sovereign state bailout
      programme), then such a country will not qualify as a benchmark country
      for the reference value; which then only will be calculated upon data
      from fewer than 3 EU member states.[13] In example, Ireland was found to
      be an interest rate outlier not qualifying for the reference value
      calculation in the assessment month March 2012, when it was measured to
      have a long-term interest rate average being 4.71 percentage points above
      the eurozone average â while at the same time having no complete access
      to the financial lending markets.[14] When Ireland was assessed again in
      April 2013, it was, however, deemed no longer to be an outlier, due to
      posting a long-term interest rate average only 1.59 percentage points
      above the eurozone average â while also having regained complete access
      to the financial lending markets for the last 1.5 month of the assessment
      period.[15] A final relevant example appeared in April 2014, when
      Portugal likewise was found not to be an interest rate outlier, due to
      posting a long-term interest rate average being 2.89 percentage points
      above the eurozone average â while having regained complete access to
      the financial lending markets for the last 12 months of the assessment
      period.[6]
The ECB publishes a Convergence Report at least every two years to check how
well the EU members aspiring for euro adoption comply with the criteria. The
first full convergence report was published in November 1996, and concluded
that only 3 out of 15 EU member states (Denmark, Luxembourg and Ireland) were
completely compliant with the criteria at that point in time.[16] As a majority
of states were not in compliance, the Council decided to delay the introduction
of the euro by two years to 1 January 1999.[17] In March 1998 a more positive
second convergence report concluded that 11 out of 12 applying countries were
prepared for the electronic introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, with
only Greece failing to qualify by the deadline.[18] Subsequent convergence
reports have so far resulted in an additional 8 EU member states complying with
all criteria and adopting the euro (Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The latest convergence report was published in
June 2014, and checked for compliance in the reference year from May 2012 â
April 2014, where Lithuania managed to fully comply â thus becoming the next
19th eurozone member.[6] As the reference values for HICP inflation and long-
term interest rates change on a monthly basis, any member state with a euro
derogation has the right to ask the ECB for an updated compliance check,
whenever they believe they have met all both economic and legal convergence
criteria. For example, Latvia asked for such an extraordinary compliance check
in March 2013 (outside the regular 2-year interval for automatic assessments).

In 2009 the authors of a confidential International_Monetary_Fund (IMF) report
suggested that in light of the ongoing global_financial_crisis, the EU_Council
should consider granting new EU member states which are having difficulty
complying with all five convergence criteria the option to "partially adopt"
the euro, along the lines of the monetary_agreements signed with the European
microstates outside the EU. These states would gain the right to adopt the euro
and issue a national variant of euro coins, but would not get a seat in ECB or
the Eurogroup until they met all the convergence criteria.[30] However, the EU
has not made use of this alternative accession process.

  Criterion fulfilled

  Criterion potentially fulfilled: If the budget deficit exceeds the 3% limit,
but is "close" to this value (the European_Commission has deemed 3.5% to be
close by in the past),[42] then the criteria can still potentially be fulfilled
if either the deficits in the previous two years are significantly declining
towards the 3% limit, or if the excessive deficit is the result of exceptional
circumstances which are temporary in nature (i.e. one-off expenditures
triggered by a significant economic downturn, or by the implementation of
economic reforms that are expected to deliver a significant positive impact on
the government's future fiscal budgets). However, even if such "special
circumstances" are found to exist, additional criteria must also be met to
comply with the fiscal budget criterion.[2][3] Additionally, if the debt-to-GDP
ratio exceeds 60% but is "sufficiently diminishing and approaching the
reference value at a satisfactory pace" it can be deemed to be in compliance.
[3]

  Criterion not fulfilled

  Notes
   1. ^ As of January 2015, Bulgaria is not officially part of ERM II.[20] The
      Bulgarian_National_Bank pursues its primary objective of price stability
      through an exchange rate anchor in the context of a Currency_Board
      Arrangement (CBA), obliging them to exchange monetary liabilities and
      euro at the official exchange rate 1.95583 BGN/EUR without any limit. The
      CBA was introduced on 1 July 1997 as a 1:1 peg against German_mark, and
      the peg subsequently changed to euro on 1 January 1999.[6]
   2. ^ Sweden, while obliged to adopt the euro under its Treaty_of_Accession,
      has chosen to deliberately fail to meet the convergence_criteria for euro
      adoption by not joining ERM_II without prior approval by a referendum.
   3. ^ The rate of increase of the 12-month average HICP over the prior 12-
      month average must be no more than 1.5% larger than the unweighted
      arithmetic average of the similar HICP inflation rates in the 3 EU member
      states with the lowest HICP inflation. If any of these 3 states have a
      HICP rate significantly below the similarly averaged HICP rate for the
      eurozone (which according to ECB practice means more than 2% below), and
      if this low HICP rate has been primarily caused by exceptional
      circumstances (i.e. severe wage cuts or a strong recession), then such a
      state is not included in the calculation of the reference value and is
      replaced by the EU state with the fourth lowest HICP rate.
   4. ^ The arithmetic average of the annual yield of 10-year government bonds
      as of the end of the past 12 months must be no more than 2.0% larger than
      the unweighted arithmetic average of the bond yields in the 3 EU member
      states with the lowest HICP inflation. If any of these states have bond
      yields which are significantly larger than the similarly averaged yield
      for the eurozone (which according to previous ECB reports means more than
      2% above) and at the same time does not have complete funding access to
      financial markets (which is the case for as long as a government receives
      bailout funds), then such a state is not be included in the calculation
      of the reference value.
   5. ^ The change in the annual average exchange rate against the euro.
   6. ^ Reference values from the ECB convergence report of May 2018.[39]
   7. ^ Cyprus, Ireland and Finland were the reference states.[39]
   8. ^ The maximum allowed change in rate is Â± 2.25% for Denmark.
   9. ^ Cyprus, Ireland and Finland were the reference states.[39]
**** Reference values[edit] ****
The compliance check above was conducted in June 2014, with the HICP and
interest rate reference values specifically applying for the last assessment
month with available data (April 2014). As reference values for HICP and
interest rates are subject for monthly changes, any EU member state with a euro
derogation, has the right to ask for a renewed compliance check at any time
during the year. For this potential extra assessment, the table below feature
Eurostat's monthly recalculation of criteria values being used in the
calculation process to determine the upper limit for HICP inflation and long-
term interest rates, where a certain fixed buffer value is added to the moving
yearly average for the three EU Member States with the lowest HICP figures
(ignoring states classified as "outliers").
The black values in the table are sourced by the officially published
convergence reports, while the lime-green values are only qualified estimates
â not confirmed by any official convergence report â but sourced by monthly
estimation reports published by the Polish_Ministry_of_Finance. The reason why
the lime-green values are only estimates, is because the "outlier" selection
â ignoring certain states from the reference value calculation â beside of
depending on a quantitative assessment also depends on a more complicated
overall qualitative assessment, and hence it can not be predicted with absolute
certainty who of the states the Commission will deem to be outliers. So any
selection of outliers by the lime-green data lines â shall only be regarded
as qualified estimates â which potentially could be different from those
outliers which the Commission would have selected if they had published a
specific report at the concerned point of time.[nb_1]
The national fiscal accounts for the previous full calendar year are released
each year in April (next time 23 April 2015).[45] As the compliance check for
both the debt and deficit criteria always awaits this release in a new calendar
year, the first possible month to request a compliance check will be April,
which would result in a data check for the HICP and Interest rates during the
reference year from 1 April to 31 March. Any EU Member State may also ask the
European Commission to conduct a compliance check, at any point of time during
the remainder of the year, with HICP and interest rates always checked for the
past 12 months â while debt and deficit compliance always will be checked for
the 3-year period encompassing the last completed full calendar year and the
two subsequent forecast years.[6][13] As of 12 September 2014, all of the
remaining euro derogation states without an opt-out, had not yet entered ERM-
II,[20] which mean its highly unlikely any of them will ask the European
Commission to conduct an extraordinary compliance check ahead of the
publication of the next regular convergence report (scheduled for release in
May/June 2016).

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ A particular high uncertainty exists for the Polish selection of HICP
      outliers, as it is only based upon evaluation of the first part of the
      official outlier criteria. The official outlier criteria require both (1)
      The HICP rate to be significantly below the eurozone average and (2) This
      "significant below" HICP to stem from adverse price developments from
      exceptional factors (i.e. severe enforced wage cuts, exceptional
      developments in energy/food/currency markets, or a strong recession).
      Precedent assessment cases proof the second part of the outlier criteria
      also needs to be met, i.e. Finland had a HICP criteria value being 1.7%
      below eurozone average in August 2004 without being classified to be
      "HICP outlier" by the European Commission,[43] and Sweden likewise had a
      HICP criteria value being 1.4% below eurozone average in April 2013
      without being classified to be "HICP outlier" by the European Commission.
      [15]
      In addition to the uncertainty related to the fact that the Polish source
      only evaluate the first requirement, there is also uncertainty related to
      the Polish quantification of what "significant below" means. For all
      assessment months until March 2014, the Polish source had adopted the
      assumption (based on precedent assessment cases) that "all states with
      HICP criteria values minimum 1.8% below eurozone average" should be
      classified to be "HICP outliers". Based on the 2014 EC Convergence
      report's classification of Cyprus with a HICP criteria value only 1.4%
      below eurozone average as a "HICP outlier", the Polish source accordingly
      also adjusted their "HICP outlier selection criteria" from April 2014
      onwards, so that it now automatically classify "all states with HICP
      criteria values minimum 1.4% below eurozone average" as "HICP outliers".
      [44] The European Commission never quantified what "significant below"
      means, which is why the Polish source attempts to quantify it based on
      precedent assessment cases, but this also mean it is uncertain whether or
      not the currently assumed 1.4% limit is correct â because it could
      perhaps just as well be 1.0%.
