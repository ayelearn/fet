Electrostatics is a branch of physics that studies electric_charges at rest.
Since classical_physics, it has been known that some materials such as amber
attract lightweight particles after rubbing. The Greek word for amber,
Î®Î»ÎµÎºÏÏÎ¿Î½, or electron, was the source of the word 'electricity'.
Electrostatic phenomena arise from the forces that electric charges exert on
each other. Such forces are described by Coulomb's_law. Even though
electrostatically induced forces seem to be rather weak, some electrostatic
forces such as the one between an electron and a proton, that together make up
a hydrogen atom, is about 36 orders_of_magnitude stronger than the
gravitational force acting between them.
There are many examples of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the
attraction of the plastic wrap to one's hand after it is removed from a package
to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of
electronic components during manufacturing, and photocopier & laser_printer
operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the surface of
objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens
whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange
are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high
resistance to electrical flow. This is because the charges that transfer are
trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed. These
charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are
quickly neutralized by a discharge: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static
'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from
contact with insulated surfaces.

***** Coulomb's law[edit] *****
Main article: Coulomb's_law
Coulomb's law states that:
'The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between
two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of
charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.'
The force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the
same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have
different signs, the force between them is attractive.
If     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] is the distance (in meters) between two
charges, then the force (in newtons) between two point charges     q
{\displaystyle q}  [q] and     Q   {\displaystyle Q}  [Q] (in coulombs) is:
         F =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0         q Q   r  2     =  k  0      q
      Q   r  2      ,   {\displaystyle F={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}
      {\frac {qQ}{r^{2}}}=k_{0}{\frac {qQ}{r^{2}}}\,,}  [{\displaystyle F=
      {\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {qQ}{r^{2}}}=k_{0}{\frac {qQ}{r^
      {2}}}\,,}]
where Îµ0 is the vacuum_permittivity, or permittivity of free space:[1]
          &#x03B5;  0   &#x2248;    10  &#x2212; 9    36 &#x03C0;        C  2

A single proton has a charge of e, and the electron has a charge of âe,

These physical_constants (Îµ0, k0, e) are currently defined so that Îµ0 and k0
are exactly defined, and e is a measured quantity.
***** Electric field[edit] *****
The electrostatic_field (lines with arrows) of a nearby positive charge (+)
causes the mobile charges in conductive objects to separate due to
electrostatic_induction. Negative charges (blue) are attracted and move to the
surface of the object facing the external charge. Positive charges (red) are
repelled and move to the surface facing away. These induced surface charges are
exactly the right size and shape so their opposing electric field cancels the
electric field of the external charge throughout the interior of the metal.
Therefore, the electrostatic field everywhere inside a conductive object is
zero, and the electrostatic_potential is constant.
The electric_field,        E &#x2192;      {\displaystyle {\vec {E}}}  [{\vec
{E}}], in units of newtons per coulomb or volts per meter, is a vector_field
that can be defined everywhere, except at the location of point charges (where
it diverges to infinity).[2] It is defined as the electrostatic force        F
&#x2192;       {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}\,}  [{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}\,}] in
newtons on a hypothetical small test_charge at the point due to Coulomb's_Law,
divided by the magnitude of the charge     q    {\displaystyle q\,}  [q\,] in
coulombs
            E &#x2192;    =      F &#x2192;    q      {\displaystyle {\vec
      {E}}={{\vec {F}} \over q}\,}  [{\displaystyle {\vec {E}}={{\vec {F}}
      \over q}\,}]
Electric_field_lines are useful for visualizing the electric field. Field lines
begin on positive charge and terminate on negative charge. They are parallel to
the direction of the electric field at each point, and the density of these
field lines is a measure of the magnitude of the electric field at any given
point.
Consider a collection of     N   {\displaystyle N}  [N] particles of charge
Q  i     {\displaystyle Q_{i}}  [Q_{i}], located at points         r &#x2192;
i     {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}_{i}}  [\vec r_i] (called source points), the
electric field at        r &#x2192;      {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}  [\vec r ]
(called the field point) is:[2]
            E &#x2192;    (    r &#x2192;    ) =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0
      &#x2211;  i = 1   N           R  &#x005E;     i    Q  i      &#x2016;
      R &#x2192;      i   &#x2016;   2     ,   {\displaystyle {\vec {E}}({\vec
      {r}})={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}{\frac {{\widehat
      {\mathcal {R}}}_{i}Q_{i}}{\left\|{\mathcal {\vec {R}}}_{i}\right\|^
      {2}}},}  [{\vec  {E}}({\vec  r})={\frac  {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}\sum
      _{{i=1}}^{N}{\frac  {\widehat {\mathcal  R}_{i}Q_{i}}{\left\|{\mathcal
      {\vec  R}}_{i}\right\|^{2}}},]
where          R  &#x2192;     i   =    r &#x2192;    &#x2212;     r &#x2192;
i   ,   {\displaystyle {\vec {\mathcal {R}}}_{i}={\vec {r}}-{\vec {r}}_{i},}  [
{\vec  {\mathcal  R}}_{i}={\vec  r}-{\vec  r}_{i},] is the displacement vector
from a source point         r &#x2192;     i     {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}_{i}}
[\vec r_i] to the field point        r &#x2192;      {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}
[\vec r ], and          R  &#x005E;     i   =      R  &#x2192;     i    /
&#x2016;      R  &#x2192;     i   &#x2016;    {\displaystyle {\widehat
{\mathcal {R}}}_{i}={\vec {\mathcal {R}}}_{i}/\left\|{\vec {\mathcal {R}}}_
{i}\right\|}  [\widehat {\mathcal  R}_{i}={\vec  {\mathcal  R}}_{i}/\left\|
{\vec  {\mathcal  R}}_{i}\right\|] is a unit_vector that indicates the
direction of the field. For a single point charge at the origin, the magnitude
of this electric field is     E =  k  e   Q  /     R    2   ,   {\displaystyle
E=k_{e}Q/{\mathcal {R}}^{2},}  [E =k_eQ/\mathcal R^2,] and points away from
that charge is positive. The fact that the force (and hence the field) can be
calculated by summing over all the contributions due to individual source
particles is an example of the superposition_principle. The electric field
produced by a distribution of charges is given by the volume charge_density
&#x03C1; (    r &#x2192;    )   {\displaystyle \rho ({\vec {r}})}  [\rho ({\vec
{r}})] and can be obtained by converting this sum into a triple_integral:
            E &#x2192;    (    r &#x2192;    ) =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0
      &#x222D;       r &#x2192;    &#x2212;    r &#x2192;      &#x2032;
      &#x2016;     r &#x2192;    &#x2212;    r &#x2192;      &#x2032;
      &#x2016;   3     &#x03C1; (    r &#x2192;      &#x2032;  )  d  3
      &#x2061; r   &#x2032;    {\displaystyle {\vec {E}}({\vec {r}})={\frac {1}
      {4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}\iiint {\frac {{\vec {r}}-{\vec {r}}\,'}{\left\|
      {\vec {r}}-{\vec {r}}\,'\right\|^{3}}}\rho ({\vec {r}}\,')\operatorname
      {d} ^{3}r\,'}  [\vec{E}(\vec r)= \frac {1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \iiint
      \frac {\vec r - \vec r \,'}{\left \| \vec r - \vec r \,' \right \|^3}
      \rho (\vec r \,')\operatorname{d}^3 r\,'
      ]
**** Gauss' law[edit] ****
Gauss'_law states that "the total electric flux through any closed surface in
free space of any shape drawn in an electric field is proportional to the total
electric_charge enclosed by the surface." Mathematically, Gauss's law takes the
form of an integral equation:
             &#x222E;       S   &#x2061;    E &#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d     A
      &#x2192;    =   1  &#x03B5;  0       Q  e n c l o s e d   =  &#x222B;  V
      &#x03C1;  &#x03B5;  0     &#x22C5;  d  3   &#x2061; r ,   {\displaystyle
      \oint _{S}{\vec {E}}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec {A}}={\frac {1}{\varepsilon _
      {0}}}\,Q_{enclosed}=\int _{V}{\rho \over \varepsilon _{0}}\cdot
      \operatorname {d} ^{3}r,}  [\oint_S\vec{E} \cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{A}  =
      \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0}\,Q_{enclosed}=\int_V
      {\rho\over\varepsilon_0}\cdot\operatorname{d}^3 r,]
where      d  3   &#x2061; r =  d  x &#xA0;  d  y &#xA0;  d  z   {\displaystyle
\operatorname {d} ^{3}r=\mathrm {d} x\ \mathrm {d} y\ \mathrm {d} z}
[ \operatorname{d}^3 r =\mathrm{d}x \ \mathrm{d}y \ \mathrm{d}z ] is a volume
element. If the charge is distributed over a surface or along a line, replace
&#x03C1;   d   3   r   {\displaystyle \rho \mathrm {d} ^{3}r}  [ \rho\mathrm
{d}^3r ] by     &#x03C3;  d  A   {\displaystyle \sigma \mathrm {d} A}
[ \sigma\mathrm{d}A ] or     &#x03BB;  d  &#x2113;   {\displaystyle \lambda
\mathrm {d} \ell }  [ \lambda\mathrm{d}\ell ]. The Divergence_Theorem allows
Gauss's Law to be written in differential form:
            &#x2207; &#x2192;    &#x22C5;    E &#x2192;    =   &#x03C1;
      &#x03B5;  0     .   {\displaystyle {\vec {\nabla }}\cdot {\vec {E}}={\rho
      \over \varepsilon _{0}}.}  [\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E} =
      {\rho\over\varepsilon_0}.]
where        &#x2207; &#x2192;    &#x22C5;   {\displaystyle {\vec {\nabla
}}\cdot }  [\vec{\nabla} \cdot] is the divergence_operator.
**** Poisson and Laplace equations[edit] ****
The definition of electrostatic potential, combined with the differential form
of Gauss's law (above), provides a relationship between the potential Î¦ and
the charge density Ï:
           &#x2207;   2   &#x03D5; = &#x2212;   &#x03C1;  &#x03B5;  0     .
      {\displaystyle {\nabla }^{2}\phi =-{\rho \over \varepsilon _{0}}.}  [
      {\nabla}^2 \phi = - {\rho\over\varepsilon_0}.]
This relationship is a form of Poisson's_equation. In the absence of unpaired
electric charge, the equation becomes Laplace's_equation:
           &#x2207;   2   &#x03D5; = 0 ,   {\displaystyle {\nabla }^{2}\phi
      =0,}  [{\nabla}^2 \phi = 0,]
***** Electrostatic approximation[edit] *****
The validity of the electrostatic approximation rests on the assumption that
the electric field is irrotational:
            &#x2207; &#x2192;    &#x00D7;    E &#x2192;    = 0.
      {\displaystyle {\vec {\nabla }}\times {\vec {E}}=0.}  [\vec
      {\nabla}\times\vec{E} = 0.]
From Faraday's_law, this assumption implies the absence or near-absence of
time-varying magnetic fields:
            &#x2202;    B &#x2192;      &#x2202; t    = 0.   {\displaystyle
      {\partial {\vec {B}} \over \partial t}=0.}  [{\partial\vec
      {B}\over\partial t} = 0.]
In other words, electrostatics does not require the absence of magnetic fields
or electric currents. Rather, if magnetic fields or electric currents do exist,
they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they must change with
time only very slowly. In some problems, both electrostatics and magnetostatics
may be required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can
still be ignored. Electrostatics and magnetostatics can both be seen as
Galilean limits for electromagnetism.[3][verification_needed]
**** Electrostatic potential[edit] ****
As the electric field is irrotational, it is possible to express the electric
field as the gradient of a scalar function,    &#x03D5;   {\displaystyle \phi }
[\phi ], called the electrostatic_potential (also known as the voltage). An
electric field,     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E], points from regions of high
electric potential to regions of low electric potential, expressed
mathematically as
            E &#x2192;    = &#x2212;    &#x2207; &#x2192;    &#x03D5; .
      {\displaystyle {\vec {E}}=-{\vec {\nabla }}\phi .}  [\vec{E} = -\vec
      {\nabla}\phi.]
The gradient_theorem can be used to establish that the electrostatic potential
is the amount of work per unit charge required to move a charge from point
a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] to point     b   {\displaystyle b}  [b] with the
following line_integral:
         &#x2212;  &#x222B;  a   b       E &#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d     &#x2113;
      &#x2192;     = &#x03D5; (    b &#x2192;    ) &#x2212; &#x03D5; (    a
      &#x2192;    ) .   {\displaystyle -\int _{a}^{b}{{\vec {E}}\cdot \mathrm
      {d} {\vec {\ell }}}=\phi ({\vec {b}})-\phi ({\vec {a}}).}  [ -\int_a^b
      {\vec{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec \ell} = \phi (\vec b) -\phi(\vec a).]
From these equations, we see that the electric potential is constant in any
region for which the electric field vanishes (such as occurs inside a
conducting object).
**** Electrostatic energy[edit] ****
Main articles: Electric_potential_energy and Energy_density
A single test_particle's potential energy,      U   E    single
{\displaystyle U_{\mathrm {E} }^{\text{single}}}  [  U_\mathrm{E}^{\text
{single}}], can be calculated from a line_integral of the work,      q  n
E &#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d     &#x2113; &#x2192;      {\displaystyle q_{n}{\vec

integrate from a point at infinity, and assume a collection of     N

is:

      [  U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{single}}=q\phi(\vec r)=\frac{q }{4\pi
      \varepsilon_0}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{Q_i}{\left \|\mathcal{\vec R_i} \right
      \|} ]
where          R  i    &#x2192;    =    r &#x2192;    &#x2212;     r &#x2192;
i     {\displaystyle {\vec {\mathcal {R_{i}}}}={\vec {r}}-{\vec {r}}_{i}}  [
{\vec  {\mathcal  {R_{i}}}}={\vec  r}-{\vec  r}_{i}] is the distance of each
charge      Q  i     {\displaystyle Q_{i}}  [Q_{i}] from the test_charge     q
{\displaystyle q}  [q], which situated at the point        r &#x2192;

if the test_charge were not present. If only two charges are present, the
potential energy is      k  e    Q  1    Q  2    /  r   {\displaystyle k_{e}Q_
{1}Q_{2}/r}  [k_eQ_1Q_2/r]. The total electric_potential_energy due a
collection of N charges is calculating by assembling these particles one_at_a
time:
          U   E    total   =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0       &#x2211;  j = 1
      N    Q  j    &#x2211;  i = 1   j &#x2212; 1      Q  i    r  i j     =   1
      2    &#x2211;  i = 1   N    Q  i    &#x03D5;  i   ,   {\displaystyle U_
      {\mathrm {E} }^{\text{total}}={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}\sum _
      {j=1}^{N}Q_{j}\sum _{i=1}^{j-1}{\frac {Q_{i}}{r_{ij}}}={\frac {1}{2}}\sum
      _{i=1}^{N}Q_{i}\phi _{i},}  [U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{total}} = \frac{1 }{4\pi
      \varepsilon _0}\sum_{j=1}^N Q_j \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \frac{Q_i}{r_{ij}}=
      \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N Q_i\phi_i ,]
where the following sum from, j = 1 to N, excludes i = j:
          &#x03D5;  i   =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0       &#x2211;  j = 1
      ( j &#x2260; i )   N      Q  j    r  i j     .   {\displaystyle \phi _
      {i}={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}\sum _{j=1(j\neq i)}^{N}{\frac {Q_
      {j}}{r_{ij}}}.}  [\phi_i = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon _0}\sum_{j=1 (j\ne
      i)}^N \frac{Q_j}{r_{ij}}. ]
This electric potential,      &#x03D5;  i     {\displaystyle \phi _{i}}  [\phi
_{i}] is what would be measured at         r &#x2192;     i     {\displaystyle
{\vec {r}}_{i}}  [\vec r_i] if the charge      Q  i     {\displaystyle Q_{i}}
[Q_{i}] were missing. This formula obviously excludes the (infinite) energy
that would be required to assemble each point charge from a disperse cloud of
charge. The sum over charges can be converted into an integral over charge
density using the prescription     &#x2211; ( &#x22EF; ) &#x2192; &#x222B;
( &#x22EF; ) &#x03C1;   d   3   r   {\displaystyle \sum (\cdots )\rightarrow
\int (\cdots )\rho \mathrm {d} ^{3}r}  [\sum (\cdots) \rightarrow \int
(\cdots)\rho\mathrm d^3r]:
          U   E    total   =   1 2   &#x222B; &#x03C1; (    r &#x2192;    )
      &#x03D5; (    r &#x2192;    )  d  3   &#x2061; r =    &#x03B5;  0   2
      &#x222B;   |   E   |   2    d  3   &#x2061; r   {\displaystyle U_{\mathrm
      {E} }^{\text{total}}={\frac {1}{2}}\int \rho ({\vec {r}})\phi ({\vec
      {r}})\operatorname {d} ^{3}r={\frac {\varepsilon _{0}}{2}}\int \left|
      {\mathbf {E} }\right|^{2}\operatorname {d} ^{3}r}  [U_\mathrm{E}^{\text
      {total}} = \frac{1}{2} \int\rho(\vec{r})\phi(\vec{r}) \operatorname{d}^3
      r = \frac{\varepsilon_0 }{2} \int  \left|{\mathbf{E}}\right|^2
      \operatorname{d}^3 r],
This second expression for electrostatic_energy uses the fact that the electric
field is the negative gradient of the electric potential, as well as vector
calculus_identities in a way that resembles integration_by_parts. These two
integrals for electric field energy seem to indicate two mutually exclusive
formulas for electrostatic energy density, namely       1 2   &#x03C1; &#x03D5;
{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\rho \phi }  [\frac{1}{2}\rho\phi] and
&#x03B5;  0   2    E  2     {\displaystyle {\frac {\varepsilon _{0}}{2}}E^{2}}
[\frac{\varepsilon_0 }{2}E^2]; they yield equal values for the total
electrostatic energy only if both are integrated over all space.[4]
**** Electrostatic pressure[edit] ****
See also: Maxwell_stress_tensor
On a conductor, a surface charge will experience a force in the presence of an
electric_field. This force is the average of the discontinuous electric field
at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just outside the
surface amounts to:
         P =    &#x03B5;  0   2    E  2     {\displaystyle P={\frac
      {\varepsilon _{0}}{2}}E^{2}}  [ P = \frac{ \varepsilon_0 }{2} E^2 ],
This pressure tends to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the
sign of the surface charge.
***** Triboelectric series[edit] *****
Main article: Triboelectric_effect
The triboelectric_effect is a type of contact electrification in which certain
materials become electrically charged when they are brought into contact with a
different material and then separated. One of the materials acquires a positive
charge, and the other acquires an equal negative charge. The polarity and
strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface
roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties. Amber, for example, can
acquire an electric charge by friction with a material like wool. This
property, first recorded by Thales_of_Miletus, was the first electrical
phenomenon investigated by humans. Other examples of materials that can acquire
a significant charge when rubbed together include glass rubbed with silk, and
hard rubber rubbed with fur.
***** Electrostatic generators[edit] *****
Main article: Electrostatic_generator
The presence of surface_charge imbalance means that the objects will exhibit
attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields
static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces
together and then separating them due to the phenomena of contact
electrification and the triboelectric_effect. Rubbing two nonconductive objects
generates a great amount of static electricity. This is not just the result of
friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed
one on top of the other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes
longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing
objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces.
Usually insulators, e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good
at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. Some examples of these
substances are rubber, plastic, glass, and pith. Conductive objects only rarely
generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted
by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact
electrification is stored on the surface of each object. Static_electric
generators, devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and
used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.
Note that the presence of electric_current does not detract from the
electrostatic forces nor from the sparking, from the corona_discharge, or other
phenomena. Both phenomena can exist simultaneously in the same system.

      generators.
***** Charge neutralization[edit] *****
Natural electrostatic phenomena are most familiar as an occasional annoyance in
seasons of low humidity, but can be destructive and harmful in some situations
(e.g. electronics manufacturing). When working in direct contact with
integrated circuit electronics (especially delicate MOSFETs), or in the
presence of flammable gas, care must be taken to avoid accumulating and
suddenly discharging a static charge (see electrostatic_discharge).
***** Electrostatic induction[edit] *****
Main article: Electrostatic_induction
Electrostatic induction, discovered by British scientist John_Canton in 1753
and Swedish professor Johan_Carl_Wilcke in 1762[5][6][7] is a redistribution of
charges in an object caused by the electric field of a nearby charge. For
example, if a positively charged object is brought near an uncharged metal
object, the mobile negatively-charged electrons in the metal will be attracted
the external charge, and move to the side of the metal facing it, creating a
negative charge on the surface. When the electrons move out of an area they
leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' nuclei, so the side of the
metal object facing away from the charge acquires a positive charge. These
induced charges disappear when the external charge is removed. Induction is
also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper
scraps and styrofoam packing peanuts to static charges. The surface charges
induced in conductive objects exactly cancel external electric fields inside
the conductor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object. This is the
basis for the electric field shielding action of a Faraday_cage. Since the
electric field is the gradient of the voltage, electrostatic induction is also
responsible for making the electric_potential (voltage) constant throughout a
conductive object.
***** 'Static' electricity[edit] *****
Main article: Static_electricity
Lightning over Oradea in Romania
Before the year 1832, when Michael_Faraday published the results of his
experiment on the identity of electricities, physicists thought "static
electricity" was somehow different from other electrical charges. Michael
Faraday proved that the electricity induced from the magnet, voltaic
electricity produced by a battery, and static electricity are all the same.
Static electricity is usually caused when certain materials are rubbed against
each other, like wool on plastic or the soles of shoes on carpet. The process
causes electrons to be pulled from the surface of one material and relocated on
the surface of the other material.
A static shock occurs when the surface of the second material, negatively
charged with electrons, touches a positively charged conductor, or vice versa.
Static electricity is commonly used in xerography, air_filters, and some
automotive paints. Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on two
objects that have become separated from each other. Small electrical components
can easily be damaged by static electricity. Component manufacturers use a
number of antistatic_devices to avoid this.
**** Static electricity and chemical industry[edit] ****
When different materials are brought together and then separated, an
accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively
charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you
receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet is an example
of excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging
between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body
can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static
electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those
industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark
may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.
A similar charging mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing
through pipelinesâa process called flow electrification. Fluids which have
low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called
accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-
accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine as fast as they are
separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant. In the
petrochemical_industry, 50 pS/m is the recommended minimum value of electrical
conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.
An important concept for insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This
is similar to the time constant (tau) within an RC_circuit. For insulating
materials, it is the ratio of the static dielectric_constant divided by the
electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is
sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity
of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/cm (100
pS/m) will have an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess
charge within a fluid will be almost completely dissipated after 4 to 5 times
the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.
Charge generation increases at higher fluid velocities and larger pipe
diameters, becoming quite significant in pipes 8 inches (200 mm) or larger.
Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting fluid
velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 (formerly BS-5958-Part
2) Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes
velocity limits. Because of its large impact on dielectric constant, the
recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water should be limited
to 1 m/s.
Bonding and earthing are the usual ways by which charge buildup can be
prevented. For fluids with electrical conductivity below 10 pS/m, bonding and
earthing are not adequate for charge dissipation, and anti-static additives may
be required.

***** Electrostatic induction in commercial applications[edit] *****
Electrostatic induction was used in the past to build high-voltage generators
known as influence_machines. The main component that emerged in these times is
the capacitor. Electrostatic induction is also used for electro-mechanic
precipitation or projection.In such technologies, charged particles of small
sizes are collected or deposited intentionally on surfaces. Applications range
from Electrostatic_precipitator to Spray_painting or Inkjet_printing. Recently
a new Wireless_power Transfer Technology has been based on electrostatic
induction between oscillating distant dipoles.
