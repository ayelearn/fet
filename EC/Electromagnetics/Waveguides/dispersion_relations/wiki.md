****** Dispersion relation ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Relation of wavelength/wavenumber as a function of a wave's frequency
In a prism, dispersion causes different colors to refract at different angles,
splitting white light into a rainbow of colors.
In the physical_sciences and electrical_engineering, dispersion relations
describe the effect of dispersion in a medium on the properties of a wave
traveling within that medium. A dispersion relation relates the wavelength or
wavenumber of a wave to its frequency. From this relation the phase_velocity
and group_velocity of the wave have convenient expressions which then determine
the refractive_index of the medium. More general than the geometry-dependent
and material-dependent dispersion relations, there are the overarching
KramersâKronig_relations that describe the frequency dependence of wave
propagation and attenuation.
Dispersion may be caused either by geometric boundary conditions (waveguides,
shallow water) or by interaction of the waves with the transmitting medium.
Elementary_particles, considered as matter_waves, have a nontrivial dispersion
relation even in the absence of geometric constraints and other media.
In the presence of dispersion, wave velocity is no longer uniquely defined,
giving rise to the distinction of phase_velocity and group_velocity.

***** Dispersion[edit] *****
Main articles: Dispersion_(optics), Dispersion_(water_waves), and Acoustic
dispersion
Dispersion occurs when pure plane waves of different wavelengths have different
propagation velocities, so that a wave_packet of mixed wavelengths tends to
spread out in space. The speed of a plane wave, v, is a function of the wave's
wavelength     &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ]:
         v = v ( &#x03BB; ) .    {\displaystyle v=v(\lambda ).\,}  [v=v(\lambda
      ).\,]
The wave's speed, wavelength, and frequency, f, are related by the identity
         v ( &#x03BB; ) = &#x03BB; &#xA0; f ( &#x03BB; ) .    {\displaystyle v
      (\lambda )=\lambda \ f(\lambda ).\,}  [v(\lambda )=\lambda \ f(\lambda
      ).\,]
The function     f ( &#x03BB; )   {\displaystyle f(\lambda )}  [{\displaystyle
f(\lambda )}] expresses the dispersion relation of the given medium. Dispersion
relations are more commonly expressed in terms of the angular_frequency
&#x03C9; = 2 &#x03C0; f   {\displaystyle \omega =2\pi f}  [\omega =2\pi f] and
wavenumber     k = 2 &#x03C0;  /  &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle k=2\pi /\lambda }
[k=2\pi /\lambda ]. Rewriting the relation above in these variables gives
         &#x03C9; ( k ) = v ( k ) &#xA0; k .    {\displaystyle \omega (k)=v(k)\
      k.\,}  [\omega (k)=v(k)\ k.\,]
where we now view f as a function of k. The use of Ï(k) to describe the
dispersion relation has become standard because both the phase_velocity Ï/
k and the group_velocity dÏ/dk have convenient representations via this
function.
The plane waves being considered can be described by
         A ( x , t ) =  A  0    e  2 &#x03C0; i    x &#x2212; v t  &#x03BB;
      =  A  0    e  i ( k x &#x2212; &#x03C9; t )   ,   {\displaystyle A
      (x,t)=A_{0}e^{2\pi i{\frac {x-vt}{\lambda }}}=A_{0}e^{i(kx-\omega t)},}
      [A(x,t)=A_{0}e^{{2\pi i{\frac  {x-vt}{\lambda }}}}=A_{0}e^{{i(kx-\omega
      t)}},]
where
      A is the amplitude of the wave,
      A0 = A(0,0),
      x is a position along the wave's direction of travel, and
      t is the time at which the wave is described.
***** Plane waves in vacuum[edit] *****
Plane waves in vacuum are the simplest case of wave propagation: no geometric
constraint, no interaction with a transmitting medium.
**** Electromagnetic waves in a vacuum[edit] ****
For electromagnetic_waves in vacuum, the angular frequency is proportional to
the wavenumber:
         &#x03C9; = c k .    {\displaystyle \omega =ck.\,}  [\omega =ck.\,]
This is a linear dispersion relation. In this case, the phase velocity and the
group velocity are the same:
         v =   &#x03C9; k   =    d &#x03C9;   d k    = c ;   {\displaystyle v=
      {\frac {\omega }{k}}={\frac {d\omega }{dk}}=c;}  [v={\frac  {\omega }
      {k}}={\frac  {d\omega }{dk}}=c;]
they are given by c, the speed_of_light in vacuum, a frequency-independent
constant.
**** De Broglie dispersion relations[edit] ****
The free-space dispersion plot of kinetic energy versus momentum, for many
objects of everyday life
Total energy, momentum, and mass of particles are connected through the
relativistic_dispersion_relation:[1]
          E  2   = ( m  c  2    )  2   + ( p c  )  2   ,   {\displaystyle E^
      {2}=(mc^{2})^{2}+(pc)^{2},}  [{\displaystyle E^{2}=(mc^{2})^{2}+(pc)^
      {2},}]
which in the ultrarelativistic limit is
         E = p c   {\displaystyle E=pc}  [E=pc]
and in the nonrelativistic limit is
         E = m  c  2   +    p  2    2 m    ,   {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}+{\frac
      {p^{2}}{2m}},}  [{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}+{\frac {p^{2}}{2m}},}]
where     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] is the invariant_mass. In the
nonrelativistic limit,     m  c  2     {\displaystyle mc^{2}}  [mc^2] is a
constant, and      p  2    /  ( 2 m )   {\displaystyle p^{2}/(2m)}  [
{\displaystyle p^{2}/(2m)}] is the familiar kinetic energy expressed in terms
of the momentum     p = m v   {\displaystyle p=mv}  [p = mv].
The transition from ultrarelativistic to nonrelativistic behaviour shows up as
a slope change from p to p2 as shown in the logâlog dispersion plot of E vs.
p.
Elementary particles, atomic nuclei, atoms, and even molecules behave in some
contexts as matter waves. According to the de_Broglie_relations, their kinetic
energy E can be expressed as a frequency Ï, and their momentum p as a
wavenumber k, using the reduced Planck_constant Ä§:
         E = &#x210F; &#x03C9; ,  p = &#x210F; k .   {\displaystyle E=\hbar
      \omega ,\quad p=\hbar k.}  [{\displaystyle E=\hbar \omega ,\quad p=\hbar
      k.}]
Accordingly, angular frequency and wavenumber are connected through a
dispersion relation, which in the nonrelativistic limit reads
         &#x03C9; =    &#x210F;  k  2     2 m    .   {\displaystyle \omega =
      {\frac {\hbar k^{2}}{2m}}.}  [{\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {\hbar k^{2}}
      {2m}}.}]
      Animation: phase and group velocity of electrons
      [DeBroglie3.gif]
      This animation portrays the de Broglie phase and group velocities (in slow
      motion) of three free electrons traveling over a field 0.4 Ã¥ngstrÃ¶ms in
      width. The momentum per unit mass (proper velocity) of the middle electron is
      lightspeed, so that its group velocity is 0.707 c. The top electron has twice
      the momentum, while the bottom electron has half. Note that as the momentum
      increases, the phase velocity decreases down to c, whereas the group velocity
      increases up to c, until the wave packet and its phase maxima move together
      near the speed of light, whereas the wavelength continues to decrease without
      bound. Both transverse and longitudinal coherence widths (packet sizes) of
      such high energy electrons in the lab may be orders of magnitude larger than
      the ones shown here.
***** Frequency versus wavenumber[edit] *****
As mentioned above, when the focus in a medium is on refraction rather than
absorptionâthat is, on the real part of the refractive_indexâit is common
to refer to the functional dependence of angular frequency on wavenumber as the
dispersion relation. For particles, this translates to a knowledge of energy as
a function of momentum.
**** Waves and optics[edit] ****
Further information: Dispersion_(optics)
The name "dispersion relation" originally comes from optics. It is possible to
make the effective speed of light dependent on wavelength by making light pass
through a material which has a non-constant index_of_refraction, or by using
light in a non-uniform medium such as a waveguide. In this case, the waveform
will spread over time, such that a narrow pulse will become an extended pulse,
i.e., be dispersed. In these materials,        &#x2202; &#x03C9;   &#x2202; k
{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \omega }{\partial k}}}  [{\frac  {\partial
\omega }{\partial k}}] is known as the group_velocity[2] and corresponds to the
speed at which the peak of the pulse propagates, a value different from the
phase_velocity.[3]
**** Deep water waves[edit] ****
Further information: Dispersion_(water_waves) and Airy_wave_theory
Frequency dispersion of surface gravity waves on deep water. The â red dot
moves with the phase velocity, and the â green dots propagate with the group
velocity. In this deep-water case, the phase velocity is twice the group
velocity. The â red dot traverses the figure in the time it takes the green
dot to traverse half.
The dispersion relation for deep water_waves is often written as
         &#x03C9; =   g k   ,   {\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {gk}},}  [
      {\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {gk}},}]
where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Deep water, in this respect, is
commonly denoted as the case where the water depth is larger than half the
wavelength.[4] In this case the phase velocity is
          v  p   =   &#x03C9; k   =    g k    ,   {\displaystyle v_{p}={\frac
      {\omega }{k}}={\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}},}  [{\displaystyle v_{p}={\frac
      {\omega }{k}}={\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}},}]
and the group velocity is
          v  g   =    d &#x03C9;   d k    =   1 2    v  p   .   {\displaystyle
      v_{g}={\frac {d\omega }{dk}}={\frac {1}{2}}v_{p}.}  [{\displaystyle v_
      {g}={\frac {d\omega }{dk}}={\frac {1}{2}}v_{p}.}]
**** Waves on a string[edit] ****
Further information: Vibrating_string
Two-frequency beats of a non-dispersive transverse wave. Since the wave is non-
dispersive, â phase and â group velocities are equal.
For an ideal string, the dispersion relation can be written as
         &#x03C9; = k    T &#x03BC;    ,   {\displaystyle \omega =k{\sqrt
      {\frac {T}{\mu }}},}  [{\displaystyle \omega =k{\sqrt {\frac {T}{\mu
      }}},}]
where T is the tension force in the string, and Î¼ is the string's mass per
unit length. As for the case of electromagnetic waves in vacuum, ideal strings
are thus a non-dispersive medium, i.e. the phase and group velocities are equal
and independent (to first order) of vibration frequency.
For a nonideal string, where stiffness is taken into account, the dispersion
relation is written as
          &#x03C9;  2   =   T &#x03BC;    k  2   + &#x03B1;  k  4   ,
      {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}={\frac {T}{\mu }}k^{2}+\alpha k^{4},}  [
      {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}={\frac {T}{\mu }}k^{2}+\alpha k^{4},}]
where     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is a constant that
depends on the string.
**** Solid state[edit] ****
In the study of solids, the study of the dispersion relation of electrons is of
paramount importance. The periodicity of crystals means that many levels_of
energy are possible for a given momentum and that some energies might not be
available at any momentum. The collection of all possible energies and momenta
is known as the band_structure of a material. Properties of the band structure
define whether the material is an insulator, semiconductor or conductor.
**** Phonons[edit] ****
Further information: Phonon_Â§ Dispersion_relation
Phonons are to sound waves in a solid what photons are to light: they are the
quanta that carry it. The dispersion relation of phonons is also non-trivial
and important, being directly related to the acoustic and thermal properties of
a material. For most systems, the phonons can be categorized into two main
types: those whose bands become zero at the center of the Brillouin_zone are
called acoustic_phonons, since they correspond to classical sound in the limit
of long wavelengths. The others are optical_phonons, since they can be excited
by electromagnetic radiation.
**** Electron optics[edit] ****
With high-energy (e.g., 200 keV, 32 fJ) electrons in a transmission_electron
microscope, the energy dependence of higher-order Laue_zone (HOLZ) lines in
convergent beam electron_diffraction (CBED) patterns allows one, in effect, to
directly image cross-sections of a crystal's three-dimensional dispersion
surface.[5] This dynamical_effect has found application in the precise
measurement of lattice parameters, beam energy, and more recently for the
electronics industry: lattice strain.
***** History[edit] *****
Isaac_Newton studied refraction in prisms but failed to recognize the material
dependence of the dispersion relation, dismissing the work of another
researcher whose measurement of a prism's dispersion did not match Newton's
own.[6]
Dispersion of waves on water was studied by Pierre-Simon_Laplace in 1776.[7]
The universality of the KramersâKronig_relations (1926â27) became apparent
with subsequent papers on the dispersion relation's connection to causality in
the scattering_theory of all types of waves and particles.[8]
