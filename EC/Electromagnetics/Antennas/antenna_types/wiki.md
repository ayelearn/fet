****** Antenna types ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In radio systems, many different antenna types are used with specialized
properties for particular applications. Antennas can be classified in various
ways. The list below groups together antennas under common operating
principles, following the way antennas are classified in many engineering
textbooks.[1][2][3]
The dipole, monopole, array and large loop antenna types below typically
function as resonant antennas; waves of current and voltage bounce back and
forth between the ends, creating standing_waves along the elements. Aperture
antennas can be resonant or not. Traveling wave antennas are nonresonant types,
the current and voltage waves travel in one direction along the antenna
elements.

***** Isotropic[edit] *****
An isotropic_antenna (isotropic_radiator) is a hypothetical antenna that
radiates equal signal power in all directions, often compared to an
incandescent_lightbulb. It is a mathematical_model that is used as the base of
comparison to calculate the directionality or gain of real antennas. No real
antenna can have an isotropic radiation_pattern, but the isotropic radiation
pattern serves as reference for comparing the radiation intensity of other
antennas, regardless of type.
An "isotropic antenna" should not be confused with an "omnidirectional
antenna"; an isotropic antenna radiates equal power in all three dimensions,
while an omnidirectional antenna radiates equal power in all horizontal
directions, with the power radiated varying with elevation angle, but
decreasing to zero along the antenna's vertical axis.
Nearly isotropic antennas can be constructed using multiple small elements, and
are used as reference antennas for testing other antennas and for field
strength measurements, and for backup antennas on satellites which work without
the satellite being oriented towards a communication station.
***** Dipole[edit] *****
    * "Rabbit ears" dipole variant for VHF television reception
    * Two-element turnstile_antenna for reception of weather satellite data,
      137 MHz. Has circular polarization.
    * Corner_reflector UHF TV antenna with "bowtie" dipole driven element at
      its center
The dipole is the prototypical antenna on which a large class of antennas are
based. A basic dipole antenna consists of two conductors (usually metal rods or
wires) arranged symmetrically, with one side of the balanced feedline from the
transmitter or receiver attached to each.[2][4] The most common type, the half-
wave_dipole, consists of two resonant elements just under a quarter wavelength
long. This antenna radiates maximally in directions perpendicular to the
antenna's axis, giving it a small directive_gain of 2.15 dBi. Although half-
wave dipoles are used alone as omnidirectional antennas, they are also a
building block of many other more complicated directional antennas.
    * Turnstile â Two dipole antennas mounted at right angles, fed with a
      phase difference of 90Â°. This antenna is unusual in that it radiates in
      all directions (no nulls in the radiation pattern), with horizontal
      polarization in directions coplanar with the elements, circular
      polarization normal to that plane, and elliptical polarization in other
      directions. Used for receiving signals from satellites, as circular
      polarization is transmitted by many satellites.
    * Corner_reflector â A directive antenna with moderate gain of about
      8 dBi often used at UHF frequencies. Consists of a dipole mounted in
      front of two reflective metal screens joined at an angle, usually 90Â°.
      Used as a rooftop UHF television antenna and for point-to-point data
      links.
    * Patch (microstrip) â A type of antenna with elements consisting of
      metal sheets mounted over a ground plane. Similar to dipole with gain of
      6â9 dBi. Integrated into surfaces such as aircraft bodies. Their easy
      fabrication using PCB techniques have made them popular in modern
      wireless devices. Often combined into arrays.
***** Monopole[edit] *****
    * Quarter-wave whip_antenna on an FM radio for 88-108 MHz
    * Rubber_Ducky_antenna on UHF 446 MHz walkie_talkie with rubber cover
      removed.
    * VHF ground plane antenna
    * T_antenna of amateur radio station, 80 ft high, used at 1.5 MHz.
    * Mast_radiator antenna of medium_wave AM radio station, Germany
A monopole_antenna consists of a single conductor such as a metal rod, usually
mounted over the ground or an artificial conducting surface (a so-called ground
plane).[2][5] One side of the feedline from the receiver or transmitter is
connected to the conductor, and the other side to ground or the artificial
ground plane. The radio waves reflected from the ground plane seem to come from
an image_antenna below the ground, with the monopole and its image forming a
dipole, so the monopole antenna has a radiation pattern identical to the top
half of the pattern of a similar dipole antenna. Since all of the equivalent
dipole's radiation is concentrated in a half-space, the antenna has twice (3 dB
increase of) the gain of a similar dipole, not considering losses in the ground
plane.
The most common form is the quarter-wave_monopole which is one-quarter of a
wavelength long and has a gain of 5.12 dBi when mounted over a ground plane.
Monopoles have an omnidirectional radiation_pattern, so they are used for broad
coverage of an area, and have vertical_polarization. The ground_waves used for
broadcasting at low frequencies must be vertically_polarized, so large vertical
monopole antennas are used for broadcasting in the MF, LF, and VLF bands. Small
monopoles are used as nondirectional antennas on portable radios in the HF,
VHF, and UHF bands.
    * Whip â Type of antenna used on mobile and portable radios in the VHF
      and UHF bands such as boom_boxes, consists of a flexible rod, often made
      of telescoping segments.
    * Rubber_Ducky â Most common antenna used on portable two_way_radios and
      cordless_phones due to its compactness, consists of an electrically_short
      wire helix. The helix adds inductance to cancel the capacitive_reactance
      of the short radiator, making it resonant. Very low gain.
    * Ground_plane â a whip antenna with several rods extending horizontally
      from base of whip attached to the ground side of the feedline. Since
      whips are mounted above ground, the horizontal rods form an artificial
      ground_plane under the antenna to increase its gain. Used as base station
      antennas for land_mobile_radio_systems such as police, ambulance and taxi
      dispatchers.
    * Mast_radiator â A radio_tower in which the tower structure itself
      serves as the antenna. Common form of transmitting antenna for AM_radio
      stations and other MF and LF transmitters. At its base the tower is
      usually, but not necessarily, mounted on a ceramic insulator to isolate
      it from the ground.
    * T_and_inverted_L â Consist of a long horizontal wire suspended between
      two towers with insulators, with a vertical wire hanging down from it,
      attached to a feedline to the receiver or transmitter. Used on LF and VLF
      bands. The vertical wire serves as the radiator. Since at these
      frequencies the vertical wire is electrically_short, much shorter than a
      quarter wavelength, the horizontal wire(s) serve as a capacitive "hat" to
      increase the current in the vertical radiator, increasing the gain. Very
      narrow bandwidth, requires loading_coil to tune out any remaining
      capacitive reactance. Requires low resistance ground.
    * Inverted_F â Combines the advantages of the compactness of inverted-
      L antenna, and the good matching of the F-type antenna. The antenna is
      grounded at the base and fed at some intermediate point. The position of
      the feed point determines the antenna impedance. Thus, matching can be
      achieved without the need for a separate matching_network.
    * Umbrella â Very large wire transmitting antennas used on VLF bands.
      Consists of a central mast_radiator tower attached at the top to multiple
      wires extending out radially from the mast to ground, like a tent or
      umbrella, insulated at the ends. Extremely narrow bandwidth, requires
      large loading coil and low resistance counterpoise ground. Used for long
      range military communications.
***** Array[edit] *****
    * VHF collinear_array of folded_dipoles
    * Yagi-Uda television_antenna for analog channels 2-4, 47-68 MHz
    * Log-periodic_dipole_array covering 140-470 MHz
    * Sector_antennas (white bars) on cell_phone_tower. Collinear arrays of
      dipoles, these radiate a flat, fan-shaped beam.
    * Reflective_array UHF TV antenna, with bowtie dipoles to cover the UHF
      470-890 MHz band
    * US Air Force PAVE_PAWS phased_array radar antenna for ballistic missile
      detection, Alaska. The two circular arrays are each composed of
      2677 crossed dipole antennas.
    * Curtain_array shortwave transmitting antenna, Austria. Wire dipoles
      suspended between towers]]
    * Four-bay batwing television broadcasting antenna, Germany.
Array_antennas consist of multiple simple antennas working together as a single
compound antenna. Broadside arrays consist of multiple identical driven
elements, usually dipoles, fed in phase, radiating a beam perpendicular to the
antenna plane. Endfire arrays are fed out-of-phase, with the phase difference
corresponding to the distance between them; they radiate within the antenna
plane.[2][6][7] Parasitic arrays consist of multiple antennas, usually dipoles,
with one driven_element and the rest parasitic_elements, which radiate a beam
along the line of the antennas.
    * Collinear â Consist of a number of dipoles in a vertical line. It is a
      high-gain omnidirectional antenna, meaning more of the power is radiated
      in horizontal directions and less wasted radiating up into the sky or
      down onto the ground. Gain of 8â10 dBi. Used as base station antennas
      for land_mobile_radio_systems such as police, fire, ambulance, and taxi
      dispatchers, and sector_antennas for cellular_base_stations.
    * Yagi-Uda â One of the most common directional antennas at HF, VHF, and
      UHF frequencies. Consists of multiple half-wave dipole elements in a
      line, with a single driven_element and multiple parasitic_elements which
      serve to create a uni-directional or beam antenna. These typically have
      gains between 10â20 dBi depending on the number of elements used, and
      are very narrow band (with a usable bandwidth of only a few percent)
      though there are derivative designs which relax this limitation. Used for
      rooftop television_antennas, point-to-point communication links, and long
      distance shortwave communication using skywave ("skip") reflection from
      the ionosphere.
    * Log-periodic_dipole_array â Often confused with the Yagi-Uda, this
      consists of many dipole elements along a boom with gradually increasing
      lengths, all connected to the transmission line with alternating
      polarity. It is a directional antenna with a wide bandwidth. This makes
      it ideal for use as a rooftop television antenna, although its gain is
      much less than a Yagi of comparable size.
    * Reflective_array â Multiple dipoles in a two-dimensional array mounted
      in front of a flat reflecting screen. Used for radar and UHF television
      transmitting and receiving antennas.
    * Phased_array â A high gain antenna used at UHF and microwave
      frequencies which is electronically steerable. It consists of multiple
      dipoles in a two-dimensional array, each fed through an electronic phase
      shifter, with the phase shifters controlled by a computer control system.
      The beam can be instantly pointed in any direction over a wide angle in
      front of the antenna. Used for military radar and jamming systems.
    * Curtain_array â Large directional wire transmitting antenna used at HF
      by shortwave broadcasting stations. It consists of a vertical rectangular
      array of wire dipoles suspended in front of a flat reflector screen
      consisting of a vertical "curtain" of parallel wires, all supported
      between two metal towers. It radiates a horizontal beam of radio waves
      into the sky above the horizon, which is reflected by the ionosphere to
      Earth beyond the horizon.
    * Half-square antenna â A pair of ground-isolated, quarter-wave vertical
      monopoles, whose tops are connected by a line one half-wavelength long.
      The verticals are the radiators and function as a two-element array,
      similar to the bobtail curtain. The structure is shaped like the Greek
      letter_Π (not to be confused with the Half-Loop antenna described below).
      The top-to-top connecting wire serves as a phased feedline, or an
      auxiliary feed, which puts the point of maximum current at the top of
      each monopole. Neither monopole element has a wire connection to the
      ground beneath it. Top-fed monopoles produce a strong signal low to the
      horizon, as opposed to an ordinary bottom-fed monopoles. The feedpoint
      for the combined system may be placed at any of several locations.[8]
    * Batwing or superturnstile â A specialized antenna used in television
      broadcasting consisting of perpendicular pairs of dipoles with radiators
      resembling bat wings. Multiple batwing antennas are stacked vertically on
      a mast to make VHF television broadcast antennas. Omnidirectional
      radiation pattern with high gain in horizontal directions. The batwing
      shape gives them wide bandwidth.
    * Microstrip â an array of patch_antennas on a substrate fed by
      microstrip feedlines. Microwave antenna that can achieve large gains in
      compact space. Ease of fabrication by PCB techniques have made them
      popular in modern wireless devices. Beamwidth and polarization can be
      actively reconfigurable.
***** Loop[edit] *****

A two-element quad_antenna used by an amateur_radio station
Loop_antennas consist of a loop (or coil) of wire. Loop antennas interact
directly with the magnetic_field of the radio wave, rather than its electric
field, making them relatively insensitive to electrical noise within about a
quarter-wavelength of the antenna.[2][9][10] There are essentially two broad
categories of loop antennas: large loops (or full-wave loops) and small loops.
Only one design, a âhaloâ antenna, that is usually called a loop does not
fit into either the large or small loop categories.
**** Large loops[edit] ****
Full loops have the highest radiation resistance, and hence the highest
efficiency of all antennas: Their radiation resistances are several hundreds of
Ohms, whereas dipoles and monopoles are tens of Ohms, and small loops are a few
ohms, or even fractions of an Ohm.[10]
    * Large_loops â Loops with perimeter of a full wavelength, two
      wavelengths, or any whole-number multiple of a full-wavelength, are
      naturally resonant and act somewhat similarly to the full-wave or multi-
      wave dipole. When it is necessary to distinguish them from small loops,
      they are called âfull-waveâ loops.[a][2][9]
    * Quad â Although âquadâ can refer to a single quadrilateral-shaped
      loop, the term usually refers to two or more loops stacked side by side;
      at first glance, quads resemble a box_kite frame. One loop in the quad is
      connected to the feedline and functions as the driver for the antenna and
      is the main signal radiator, while the others are parasitic_element that
      act as resonators, increasing the gain.[2][9][10] Quad_antennas function
      analogously to Yagi-Uda antennas made with loops,[2][9][10] and are
      similarly used as a directional antennas on the HF bands for shortwave
      communication. They are sometimes preferred for longer wavelengths
      because (if square) they are half as wide as a Yagi.[2][9][10]
    * Half-loop â A ground-mounted upper half of a full-wavelength loop
      antenna (not to be confused with a half-square array). The full loop is
      cut at two opposite points along its perimeter, and the lower half is
      omitted. It is shaped like the Greek_letter_Π or an upside-down capital
      letter_U, and is the loop antenna analog of a ground-mounted monopole
      antenna. Like a vertical monopole, the missing lower half of the antenna
      is replaced by its ground-plane image. If shaped like a half of a square,
      a half-loop can operate either as a loop antenna or, on its first
      harmonic, as a dipole antenna whose ends have been bent over and
      grounded, depending on the form and location of the feed-point.[8]
**** Inbetween[edit] ****
    * Halo_antennas â Loops that are exactly one half-wavelength in perimeter
      â with a small gap cut in the loop â are called âhalo_antennasâ
      and are intermediate in form and function between small and large loops.
      They are often described as a half-wavelength dipole that has been folded
      into a circle, rather than being a true loop antenna.[2][9][10][11]
**** Small loops[edit] ****
The great disadvantage of any small antenna, including small loops, is a very
small radiation_resistance â typically much smaller than the loss_resistance,
making small loops very inefficient for transmitting. However, small loops are
very effective receiving antennas, especially at low frequencies, where all
feasible antennas are âsmallâ compared to a wavelength.
    * Small_loops â If the loop perimeter is smaller than a half-wavelength,
      the loop must be modified in some way to make it resonant, if resonance
      is necessary. Small loops are called âmagnetic_loopsâ, and if
      modified for resonance they are also called âtuned loopsâ. Their
      directionality and radiation efficiency is drastically different from
      full-wave loops. Small loops are widely used as compact direction_finding
      antennas.[2][9][10]
    * Ferrite_(loopstick) â Loopstick antennas are omnidirectional around
      their axes, and are premier examples of small loop antennas. They are the
      magnetic analogue of the short dipole antenna. These are used as the
      receiving antenna in most consumer AM_radios operating in the medium_wave
      broadcast band (and lower frequencies).[b] Wire is coiled around a
      ferrite_core which greatly increases the coil's inductance and its
      effective signal-capturing area. The radiation pattern is maximum at
      directions perpendicular to the ferrite rod. The null direction of
      ferrite core antennas are bi-directional and much sharper than the
      maximal directionality. This often makes the direction of the null more
      useful for locating a signal source than the direction of the strongest
      signal. The null direction of small loops can also be exploited to reject
      unwanted signals from an interfering station or noise source.[2][9][10]
***** Conical[edit] *****
    * biconical_antenna is a dipole-like antenna made of two cones, oriented
      along the same axis and oriented tip-to-tip.
    * Butterfly_antenna is a two-dimesional (flat) biconical antenna.

    * discone_antenna is half of a biconical with a flat disc mounted above the
      cone
Discone antenna dimensions
***** Aperture[edit] *****
    * NASA Cassegrain parabolic spacecraft_communication antenna, Australia.
      Uses X_band, 8 â 12 GHz. Extremely high gain ~70 dBi.
    * Microwave horn_antenna bandwidth 0.8â18 GHz
    * X_band marine_radar slot_antenna on ship, 8 â 12 GHz.
    * Dielectric lens antenna used in millimeter wave radio telescope
Aperture antennas are the main type of directional antennas used at microwave
frequencies and above.[2][12] They consist of a small dipole or loop feed
antenna inside a three-dimensional guiding structure large compared to a
wavelength, with an aperture to emit the radio waves. Since the antenna
structure itself is nonresonant they can be used over a wide frequency range by
replacing or tuning the feed antenna.
    * Parabolic â The most widely used high gain antenna at microwave
      frequencies and above. Consists of a dish-shaped metal parabolic
      reflector with a feed antenna at the focus. It can have some of the
      highest gains of any antenna type, up to 60 dBi, but the dish must be
      large compared to a wavelength. Used for radar antennas, point-to-point
      data links, satellite communication, and radio_telescopes
    * Horn â a simple antenna with moderate gain of 15 to 25 dBi that
      consists of a flaring metal horn attached to a waveguide. Used for
      applications such as radar_guns, radiometers and as feed_antennas for
      parabolic dishes.
    * Slot â consists of a waveguide with one or more slots cut in it to emit
      the microwaves. Linear slot antennas emit narrow fan-shaped beams. Used
      as UHF broadcast antennas and marine_radar antennas.
    * Lens â a lens antenna consists of layer of dielectric or a metal screen
      or multiple waveguide structure of varying thickness in front of a feed
      antenna, which acts as a lens which refracts the radio waves, focusing
      them on the feed antenna.
    * Dielectric_resonator â consists of small ball or puck-shaped piece of
      dielectric material excited by aperture in waveguide Used at millimeter
      wave frequencies
***** Traveling wave[edit] *****
    * Animation showing a Beverage antenna .
    * Quadrant antenna, similar to rhombic, at an Austrian shortwave broadcast
      station. Radiates horizontal beam at 5-9 MHz, 100 kW
    * Array of four axial-mode helical_antennas used for satellite tracking,
      France
Unlike the above antennas, traveling_wave_antennas are not_resonant so they
have inherently broad bandwidth.[2][13] They are typically wire antennas that
are multiple wavelengths long, through which the voltage and current waves
travel in one direction, instead of bouncing back and forth to form standing
waves as in resonant antennas. They have linear_polarization (except for the
helical antenna). Unidirectional traveling wave antennas are terminated by a
resistor at one end equal to the antenna's characteristic_resistance, to absorb
the waves from one direction. This makes them inefficient as transmitting
antennas.
    * Beverage â Simplest unidirectional traveling wave antenna. Consists of
      a straight wire one to several wavelengths long, suspended near the
      ground, connected to the receiver at one end and terminated by a resistor
      equal to its characteristic_impedance, 400â800 Î© at the other end. Its
      radiation pattern has a main_lobe at a shallow angle in the sky off the
      terminated end. It is used for reception of skywaves reflected off the
      ionosphere in long distance "skip" shortwave communication.
    * Rhombic â Consists of four equal wire sections shaped like a rhombus.
      It is fed by a balanced feedline at one of the acute corners, and the two
      sides are connected to a resistor equal to the characteristic resistance
      of the antenna at the other. It has a main lobe in a horizontal direction
      off the terminated end of the rhombus. Used for skywave communication on
      shortwave bands.
    * Leaky_wave â Microwave antennas consisting of a waveguide or coaxial
      cable with a slot or apertures cut in it so it radiates continuously
      along its length.
    * Helical_(axial_mode) â Consists of a wire in the shape of a helix
      mounted above a reflecting screen. It radiates circularly_polarized waves
      in a beam off the end, with a typical gain of 15 dBi. It is used at VHF
      and UHF frequencies where antenna sizes are feasible. Often used for
      satellite communication, which uses circular polarization because it is
      insensitive to the relative rotation on the beam axis. When a helical
      antenna has about 10 turns or more, each turn a full wavelength, then it
      is a form of traveling wave antenna. If it only has a few turns (or just
      one) and the turns' totaled circumference is one or a few wavelengths,
      then it is some variety of a large loop antenna. When the totaled
      circumference of all the turns taken together is less than one
      wavelength, then the helix is a continuously-loaded monopole, called a
      "rubber_ducky_antenna", or a "Slinkyâ¢" antenna, or a "broomstick"
      antenna.
***** Other antenna types[edit] *****
A typical random_wire_antenna for shortwave reception, strung between two
buildings.
The following antenna, called âthe odd bit of wireâ by Moxon (1982),[14]
doesn't easily fit into any of the categories above.
    * Random_wire â This describes the typical antenna used to receive
      shortwave radio, consisting of a random length of wire either strung
      outdoors between supports or indoors in a zigzag pattern along walls,
      connected to the receiver at one end. The antenna typically will have
      complex radiation patterns with several lobes at angles to the wire, in
      different directions for each fold in the antenna. Random wire antennas
      typically are categorized as folded monopole_antennas if their lengths
      are two wavelengths or less, but operate similarly to traveling_wave
      antennas when they are laid out in a straight line several wavelengths
      long.
***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ The popular âquadâ antenna design is necessarily a full-wave loop,
      so no other distinction is needed.
   2. ^ A notable exception are car_radios, which require an antenna outside
      the metal car chassis which blocks AM and longer-wave reception.
