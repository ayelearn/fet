Machine Design (
ISSN 0024-9114) is an American trade magazine and Web site serving the OEM
engineering market. Its print issues reach qualified design_engineers and
engineering_managers twice a month.
Key technologies covered include computer-aided_design_and_manufacturing (CAD/
CAM), electrical and electronics, fastening and joining, fluid_power,
manufacturing, engineered_materials, mechanical_engineering, and motion
control.
Today, Machine Design is owned by Informa, and has editorial offices based in
New York, New York and Cleveland, Ohio, USA.
***** History[edit] *****
The inaugural issue of Machine Design coincided almost exactly with the 1929
stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great_Depression. Although the
nation was in the economic doldrums, there was significant design development
taking place in almost all industrial segments including automotive, aircraft,
farm equipment, home appliances, and industrial machinery.
The onset of World War II came and brought almost frenetic activity to design
engineering at large. After the war, civilian industries thrived. But in the
years following the war and into the 1950s the role of design engineer
languished, stigmatized by the war effort as the creator of new means of
destruction.
Engineering colleges began to feel slighted because doctors, lawyers, and
business executives were viewed as having more prestige and professional status
than their engineering graduates.[1] Intellectual elites viewed engineering
colleges as trade schools, and graduate engineers were said to be nothing more
than mechanics or glorified shop hands. In response, engineering schools began
to drop courses that lacked academic rigor or had the slightest blue-collar
aura.
The launch of Sputnik in 1957 again changed the perception of design
engineering. The perceived loss of world leadership in air and space technology
by the people of the United States set the stage for a considerable renewal of
prestige to the engineering discipline. After more than a decade into the Cold
War, the public realized science and engineering could play a key role in
keeping the Communists at bay. The government unloaded almost limitless
supplies of money on high-tech defense industries, and engineering became the
career of choice. High salaries and generous perks were lavished on engineers
and scientists.
Unfortunately, Sputnik also accelerated the movement to delete courses on
manufacturing and shop practice from the curricula of top schools. The idea was
to portray engineers as being more scientist than a mechanic. The rocket
scientist working on the space program became the image to which most engineers
aspired.
This attitude had a lot to do with framing the editorial policies of Machine
Design through the 1960s. The policies were in tune with what was happening in
the largest and most-sophisticated corporations, especially the aircraft and
automotive industries, where design engineering and manufacturing engineering
were increasingly treated as separate entities having no common interest.
Reflecting this, articles selected for Machine Design were carefully tailored
not to have too much of a manufacturing orientation.
Starting in the late 1960s, another shift in American perception was brought
about by the growing awareness of overseas manufacturing facilities returning a
lower cost product with higher quality. While lower labor rates played a key
role in the lower costs, they could not justify the higher reliability of
offshore products over those domestically produced. It was soon discovered that
those shops with higher quality production realized design and manufacturing
engineering were closely intertwined. Machine Design articles started to
reflect this trend. For example, it's believed to be the first industrial trade
magazine to run a comprehensive article explaining numerical control machining
and how it relates to design engineering.
Machine Design's coverage of manufacturing positioned it well when concurrent
engineering became the trendy idea in industry. Major corporations suddenly
discovered that design and manufacturing were interrelated, and it became vogue
to tear down the walls between design and manufacturing engineers.
In the 1970s, finite-element_analysis broke on the industrial scene. Computer-
aided_design was evolving, and by the 1980s, it was also having a profound
impact on design procedures. Computer-aided_manufacturing evolved separately,
but by 1990 CAD and CAM had merged. In the field of electrical and electronic
technology, relay controls were giving way to digital electronics and the
microprocessor that led to combining a number of design disciplines into the
technologies of mechatronics and motion_control.
In the 2000s, the Internet_of_Things has taken hold of the industry and has
infiltrated every level of engineering, from design to manufacturing, all the
way to predictive_maintenance and Augmented_Reality. Machine Design as provided
in-depth coverage on these emerging technologies to keep engineers up to date
on what lies in store for the engineering industry.
For over 80 years, Machine Design had predicted and led the industrial
community spotting trends and fundamental changes in manufacturing operations.
Providing an ongoing series of technological overviews interspersed with in-
depth tutorials, it kept readers abreast of technologies that were transforming
product design. It does this with an editorial staff of degreed engineers
possessing industrial experience and obligated to create lucid and interesting
articles supported by the intelligent use of graphics.
