***** Physical sciences[edit] *****
**** Mathematics and Physics[edit] ****
    * Displacement_(mathematics), in mathematics, also called rigid motion or
      Euclidean motion, a geometric transformation that preserves the distance
      and the orientation
    * Displacement_(vector), is the difference between the final and initial
      position of a point (for instance, the center of mass of a moving
      object). The actual path covered to reach the final position is
      irrelevant. It can simply be defined as the length of the shortest path
      between the final point and initial point of a body or "shortest distance
      between two points".
          o Particle_displacement, a measurement of distance of the movement of
            a particle in a medium as it transmits a wave (represented in
            mathematics by the lower-case Greek letter Î¾)
          o Displacement_field_(mechanics), an assignment of displacement
            vectors for all points in a body that is displaced from one state
            to another
          o Electric_displacement_field, as appears in Maxwell's equations
    * Wien's_displacement_law, a relation concerning the spectral distribution
      of blackbody radiation
    * Angular_displacement, a change in orientation of a rigid body, the amount
      of rotation about a fixed axis.
**** Engineering[edit] ****
    * Engine_displacement, the total volume of air/fuel mixture an engine can
      draw in during one complete engine cycle
    * Displacement_(fluid), an object immersed in a fluid pushes the fluid out
      of the way
    * Positive_displacement_meter, a pump or flow meter which processes a
      definite fluid volume per revolution
    * Displacement has several meanings related to ships and boats
          o Displacement_hull, where the moving hull's weight is supported by
            buoyancy alone and it must displace water from its path rather than
            planing on the water's surface
          o Displacement_speed, a rule of thumb for non planing watercraft to
            estimate their theoretical maximum speed
          o Displacement_(ship), several related measurements of a ship's
            weight
    * Insulation_displacement_connector, a type of electrical connector
    * Displacement_mapping, a technique in 3D computer graphics
**** Chemistry[edit] ****
    * Single_displacement_reaction, a chemical reaction concerning the exchange
      of ions
    * Double_displacement_reaction, a chemical reaction concerning the exchange
      of ions
    * Radioactive_displacement_law_of_Fajans_and_Soddy, elements/isotopes
      created during radioactive decay
**** Geology[edit] ****
    * Earth Crustal Displacement, an aspect of the Pole_shift_hypothesis
***** Medicine[edit] *****
    * Displacement_(orthopedic_surgery), change in alignment of the fracture
      fragments
***** Social sciences[edit] *****
    * Displacement_(linguistics), the ability of humans (and possibly some
      animals) to communicate ideas that are remote in time and/or space
    * Forced_migration, by persecution or violence
    * Displacement_(psychology), a sub-conscious defense mechanism
    * Displacement_(parapsychology), a statistical or qualitative
      correspondence between targets and responses.
    * Development-induced_displacement, the displacement of population for
      economic development
    * Displacement may occur during gentrification.
***** Sport[edit] *****
    * Displacement_(fencing), a movement that avoids or dodges an attack
***** Other[edit] *****
    * Child_displacement
