Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering, physics,
engineering_mathematics, and materials_science principles to design, analyze,
manufacture, and maintain mechanical_systems. It is one of the oldest and
broadest of the engineering_disciplines.
The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas
including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials_science, structural
analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical
engineers use tools such as computer-aided_design (CAD), computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM), and product_life_cycle_management to design and analyze
manufacturing_plants, industrial_equipment and machinery, heating_and_cooling
systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical_devices,
weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design,
production, and operation of machinery.[1][2]
Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial_Revolution in
Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several
thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics
led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has
continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are
pursuing developments in such areas as composites, mechatronics, and
nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace_engineering, metallurgical
engineering, civil_engineering, electrical_engineering, manufacturing
engineering, chemical_engineering, industrial_engineering, and other
engineering disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical engineers may also work
in the field of biomedical_engineering, specifically with biomechanics,
transport_phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling of
biological systems.

***** History[edit] *****
The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of
various ancient and medieval societies. In ancient_Greece, the works of
Archimedes (287â212 BC) influenced mechanics in the Western tradition and
Heron_of_Alexandria (c. 10â70 AD) created the first steam engine (Aeolipile).
[3] In China, Zhang_Heng (78â139 AD) improved a water_clock and invented a
seismometer, and Ma_Jun (200â265 AD) invented a chariot with differential
gears. The medieval Chinese horologist and engineer Su_Song (1020â1101 AD)
incorporated an escapement mechanism into his astronomical clock_tower two
centuries before escapement devices were found in medieval European clocks. He
also invented the world's first known endless power-transmitting chain_drive.
[4]
During the Islamic_Golden_Age (7th to 15th century), Muslim_inventors made
remarkable contributions in the field of mechanical technology. Al-Jazari, who
was one of them, wrote his famous Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical
Devices in 1206 and presented many mechanical designs. Al-Jazari is also the
first known person to create devices such as the crankshaft and camshaft, which
now form the basics of many mechanisms.[5]
During the 17th century, important breakthroughs in the foundations of
mechanical engineering occurred in England. Sir Isaac_Newton formulated
Newton's_Laws_of_Motion and developed Calculus, the mathematical basis of
physics. Newton was reluctant to publish his works for years, but he was
finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues, such as Sir Edmond_Halley, much
to the benefit of all mankind. Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz is also credited with
creating Calculus during this time period.
During the early 19th century industrial revolution, machine_tools were
developed in England, Germany, and Scotland. This allowed mechanical
engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering. They brought
with them manufacturing machines and the engines to power them.[6] The first
British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847
Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers, thirty years after the civil engineers
formed the first such professional society Institution_of_Civil_Engineers.[7]
On the European continent, Johann von Zimmermann (1820â1901) founded the
first factory for grinding machines in Chemnitz, Germany in 1848.
In the United States, the American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers (ASME) was
formed in 1880, becoming the third such professional engineering society, after
the American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers (1852) and the American_Institute_of
Mining_Engineers (1871).[8] The first schools in the United States to offer an
engineering education were the United_States_Military_Academy in 1817, an
institution now known as Norwich_University in 1819, and Rensselaer_Polytechnic
Institute in 1825. Education in mechanical engineering has historically been
based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science.[9]
***** Education[edit] *****
Archimedes'_screw was operated by hand and could efficiently raise water, as
the animated red ball demonstrates.
Degrees in mechanical engineering are offered at various universities
worldwide. Mechanical engineering programs typically take four to five years of
study and result in a Bachelor_of_Engineering (B.Eng. or B.E.), Bachelor_of
Science (B.Sc. or B.S.), Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.), Bachelor
of_Technology (B.Tech.), Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (B.M.E.), or
Bachelor_of_Applied_Science (B.A.Sc.) degree, in or with emphasis in mechanical
engineering. In Spain, Portugal and most of South America, where neither B.S.
nor B.Tech. programs have been adopted, the formal name for the degree is
"Mechanical Engineer", and the course work is based on five or six years of
training. In Italy the course work is based on five years of education, and
training, but in order to qualify as an Engineer one has to pass a state exam
at the end of the course. In Greece, the coursework is based on a five-year
curriculum and the requirement of a 'Diploma' Thesis, which upon completion a
'Diploma' is awarded rather than a B.Sc.
In the United States, most undergraduate mechanical engineering programs are
accredited by the Accreditation_Board_for_Engineering_and_Technology (ABET) to
ensure similar course requirements and standards among universities. The ABET
web site lists 302 accredited mechanical engineering programs as of 11 March
2014.[10] Mechanical engineering programs in Canada are accredited by the
Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB),[11] and most other countries
offering engineering degrees have similar accreditation societies.
In Australia, mechanical engineering degrees are awarded as Bachelor of
Engineering (Mechanical) or similar nomenclature[12] although there are an
increasing number of specialisations. The degree takes four years of full-time
study to achieve. To ensure quality in engineering degrees, Engineers_Australia
accredits engineering degrees awarded by Australian universities in accordance
with the global Washington_Accord. Before the degree can be awarded, the
student must complete at least 3 months of on the job work experience in an
engineering firm. Similar systems are also present in South Africa and are
overseen by the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA).
In India, to become an engineer, one needs to have an engineering degree like a
B.Tech or B.E, have a diploma in engineering, or by completing a course in an
engineering trade like fitter from the Industrial_Training_Institute (ITIs) to
receive a "ITI Trade Certificate" and also pass the All India Trade Test (AITT)
with an engineering trade conducted by the National Council of Vocational
Training (NCVT) by which one is awarded a "National Trade Certificate". A
similar system is used in Nepal.
Some mechanical engineers go on to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a
Master_of_Engineering, Master_of_Technology, Master_of_Science, Master_of
Engineering_Management (M.Eng.Mgt. or M.E.M.), a Doctor_of_Philosophy in
engineering (Eng.D. or Ph.D.) or an engineer's_degree. The master's and
engineer's degrees may or may not include research. The Doctor of Philosophy
includes a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry
point to academia.[13] The Engineer's degree exists at a few institutions at an
intermediate level between the master's degree and the doctorate.
**** Coursework[edit] ****
Standards set by each country's accreditation society are intended to provide
uniformity in fundamental subject material, promote competence among graduating
engineers, and to maintain confidence in the engineering profession as a whole.
Engineering programs in the U.S., for example, are required by ABET to show
that their students can "work professionally in both thermal and mechanical
systems areas."[14] The specific courses required to graduate, however, may
differ from program to program. Universities and Institutes_of_technology will
often combine multiple subjects into a single class or split a subject into
multiple classes, depending on the faculty available and the university's major
area(s) of research.
The fundamental subjects of mechanical engineering usually include:
    * Mathematics (in particular, calculus, differential_equations, and linear
      algebra)
    * Basic physical sciences (including physics and chemistry)
    * Statics and dynamics
    * Strength_of_materials and solid_mechanics
    * Materials_engineering, Composites
    * Thermodynamics, heat_transfer, energy_conversion, and HVAC
    * Fuels, combustion, Internal_combustion_engine
    * Fluid_mechanics (including fluid_statics and fluid_dynamics)
    * Mechanism and Machine design (including kinematics and dynamics)
    * Instrumentation and measurement
    * Manufacturing_engineering, technology, or processes
    * Vibration, control_theory and control_engineering
    * Hydraulics, and pneumatics
    * Mechatronics, and robotics
    * Engineering_design and product_design
    * Drafting, computer-aided_design (CAD) and computer-aided_manufacturing
      (CAM)[15][16]
Mechanical engineers are also expected to understand and be able to apply basic
concepts from chemistry, physics, tribology, chemical_engineering, civil
engineering, and electrical_engineering. All mechanical engineering programs
include multiple semesters of mathematical classes including calculus, and
advanced mathematical concepts including differential_equations, partial
differential_equations, linear_algebra, abstract_algebra, and differential
geometry, among others.
In addition to the core mechanical engineering curriculum, many mechanical
engineering programs offer more specialized programs and classes, such as
control_systems, robotics, transport and logistics, cryogenics, fuel
technology, automotive_engineering, biomechanics, vibration, optics and others,
if a separate department does not exist for these subjects.[17]
Most mechanical engineering programs also require varying amounts of research
or community projects to gain practical problem-solving experience. In the
United States it is common for mechanical engineering students to complete one
or more internships while studying, though this is not typically mandated by
the university. Cooperative_education is another option. Future work skills[18]
research puts demand on study components that feed student's creativity and
innovation.[19]
***** Job duties[edit] *****
Mechanical engineers research, design, develop, build, and test mechanical and
thermal devices, including tools, engines, and machines.
Mechanical engineers typically do the following:
    * Analyze problems to see how mechanical and thermal devices might help
      solve the problem.
    * Design or redesign mechanical and thermal devices using analysis and
      computer-aided design.
    * Develop and test prototypes of devices they design.
    * Analyze the test results and change the design as needed.
    * Oversee the manufacturing process for the device.
Mechanical engineers design and oversee the manufacturing of many products
ranging from medical devices to new batteries. They also design power-producing
machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam
and gas turbines as well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and
air-conditioning systems.
Like other engineers, mechanical engineers use computers to help create and
analyze designs, run simulations and test how a machine is likely to work.
**** License and regulation[edit] ****
Engineers may seek license by a state, provincial, or national government. The
purpose of this process is to ensure that engineers possess the necessary
technical knowledge, real-world experience, and knowledge of the local legal
system to practice engineering at a professional level. Once certified, the
engineer is given the title of Professional_Engineer (in the United States,
Canada, Japan, South Korea, Bangladesh and South Africa), Chartered_Engineer
(in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional
Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or European Engineer (much of the
European Union).
In the U.S., to become a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), an engineer must
pass the comprehensive FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) exam, work a minimum of
4 years as an Engineering Intern (EI) or Engineer-in-Training (EIT), and pass
the "Principles and Practice" or PE (Practicing Engineer or Professional
Engineer) exams. The requirements and steps of this process are set forth by
the National_Council_of_Examiners_for_Engineering_and_Surveying (NCEES), a
composed of engineering and land surveying licensing boards representing all
U.S. states and territories.
In the UK, current graduates require a BEng plus an appropriate master's degree
or an integrated MEng degree, a minimum of 4 years post graduate on the job
competency development, and a peer reviewed project report in the candidates
specialty area in order to become a Chartered Mechanical Engineer (CEng,
MIMechE) through the Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers. CEng MIMechE can also
be obtained via an examination route administered by the City_and_Guilds_of
London_Institute.[citation_needed]
In most developed countries, certain engineering tasks, such as the design of
bridges, electric power plants, and chemical plants, must be approved by a
professional_engineer or a chartered_engineer. "Only a licensed engineer, for
instance, may prepare, sign, seal and submit engineering plans and drawings to
a public authority for approval, or to seal engineering work for public and
private clients."[20] This requirement can be written into state and provincial
legislation, such as in the Canadian provinces, for example the Ontario or
Quebec's Engineer Act.[21]
In other countries, such as Australia, and the UK, no such legislation exists;
however, practically all certifying bodies maintain a code_of_ethics
independent of legislation, that they expect all members to abide by or risk
expulsion.[22]

**** Salaries and workforce statistics[edit] ****
The total number of engineers employed in the U.S. in 2015 was roughly 1.6
million. Of these, 278,340 were mechanical engineers (17.28%), the largest
discipline by size.[23] In 2012, the median annual income of mechanical
engineers in the U.S. workforce was $80,580. The median income was highest when
working for the government ($92,030), and lowest in education ($57,090).[24] In
2014, the total number of mechanical engineering jobs was projected to grow 5%
over the next decade.[25] As of 2009, the average starting salary was $58,800
with a bachelor's degree.[26]
***** Subdisciplines[edit] *****
The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many
mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines
which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a
brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these
subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a
combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most
work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of
these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized
subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of
graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several
specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section.
**** Mechanics[edit] ****
Mohr's_circle, a common tool to study stresses in a mechanical_element
Main article: Mechanics
Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect
upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict
the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under
known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics
include
    * Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces
      affect static bodies
    * Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes
      kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics
      (about forces and resulting accelerations).
    * Mechanics_of_materials, the study of how different materials deform under
      various types of stress
    * Fluid_mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces[27]
    * Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems
      (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion.
      Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms.
    * Continuum_mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that
      objects are continuous (rather than discrete)
Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases
of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle,
statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to
evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when
designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as
the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate
materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a
ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system
for the engine.
**** Mechatronics and robotics[edit] ****

Main articles: Mechatronics and Robotics
Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an
interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical_engineering and
software_engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and
mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be
automated through the use of electric_motors, servo-mechanisms, and other
electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a
mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the
drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data
on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and
communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.
Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often
used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or
repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are
preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an
engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of
motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).
Robots are used extensively in industrial_engineering. They allow businesses to
save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise
for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many
companies employ assembly_lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries
and some factories are so robotized that they can run by_themselves. Outside
the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space_exploration, and
many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications,
from recreation to domestic applications.
**** Structural analysis[edit] ****
Main articles: Structural_analysis and Failure_analysis
Structural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering (and also civil
engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the
objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes:
static failure, and fatigue failure. Static structural failure occurs when,
upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either
breaks or is deformed plastically, depending on the criterion for failure.
Fatigue failure occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading
and unloading cycles. Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the
object: a microscopic crack on the surface of the object, for instance, will
grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to
cause ultimate_failure.[28]
Failure is not simply defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as
when a part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the perforated
top sections of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If these systems do
not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.
Structural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has
occurred, or when designing to prevent failure. Engineers often use online
documents and books such as those published by ASM[29] to aid them in
determining the type of failure and possible causes.
Once theory is applied to a mechanical design, physical testing is often
performed to verify calculated results. Structural analysis may be used in an
office when designing parts, in the field to analyze failed parts, or in
laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests.
**** Thermodynamics and thermo-science[edit] ****
Main article: Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering,
including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics
is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system.[30]
Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from
one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy
(enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that
eventually turns the wheels.
Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of
heat_transfer, thermofluids, and energy_conversion. Mechanical engineers use
thermo-science to design engines and power_plants, heating, ventilation, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat_exchangers, heat_sinks, radiators,
refrigeration, insulation, and others.[31]
**** Design and drafting[edit] ****
A CAD model of a mechanical_double_seal
Main articles: Technical_drawing and CNC
Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design
products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing
can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions
necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required
materials, and other pertinent information.[32] A U.S. mechanical engineer or
skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter
or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but
computer-aided_design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three
dimensions.
Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery,
either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a
computer-aided_manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an
engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings.
However, with the advent of computer_numerically_controlled (CNC)
manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant
technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist spray_coatings,
surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically
be done by a machine.
Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and
by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional
models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite_element
analysis (FEA) and computational_fluid_dynamics (CFD).
***** Modern tools[edit] *****
An oblique view of a four-cylinder inline crankshaft with pistons
Many mechanical engineering companies, especially those in industrialized
nations, have begun to incorporate computer-aided_engineering (CAE) programs
into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D solid
modeling computer-aided_design (CAD). This method has many benefits, including
easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create
virtual assemblies of parts, and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces
and tolerances.
Other CAE programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include product
lifecycle_management (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex
simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected
loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include finite
element_analysis (FEA), computational_fluid_dynamics (CFD), and computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM).
Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate
the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance,
and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design
nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated,
instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model
complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as
viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian_flows.
As mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in
mechatronics, multidisciplinary_design_optimization (MDO) is being used with
other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process. MDO
tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to
continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also utilize
sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible
designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult
multidisciplinary design problems.
***** Areas of research[edit] *****
Mechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is
physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient
machines and mechanical systems. Some technologies at the cutting edge of
mechanical engineering are listed below (see also exploratory_engineering).
**** Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)[edit] ****
Micron-scale mechanical components such as springs, gears, fluidic and heat
transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as
silicon, glass and polymers like SU8. Examples of MEMS components are the
accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors, modern cell phones,
gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical
applications.
**** Friction stir welding (FSW)[edit] ****
Main article: Friction_stir_welding
Friction stir welding, a new type of welding, was discovered in 1991 by The
Welding_Institute (TWI). The innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding
technique joins materials previously un-weldable, including several aluminum
alloys. It plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes,
potentially replacing rivets. Current uses of this technology to date include
welding the seams of the aluminum main Space Shuttle external tank, Orion Crew
Vehicle test article, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles
and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket, armor plating for amphibious assault ships, and
welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from
Eclipse Aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses.[33][34][35]
**** Composites[edit] ****
Composite cloth consisting of woven carbon fiber
Main article: Composite_material
Composites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide
different physical characteristics than either material separately. Composite
material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing
(and, subsequently, finding applications for) stronger or more rigid materials
while attempting to reduce weight, susceptibility to corrosion, and other
undesirable factors. Carbon fiber reinforced composites, for instance, have
been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods.
**** Mechatronics[edit] ****
Mechatronics is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering,
electronic_engineering, and software engineering. The discipline of
mechatronics began as a way to combine mechanical principles with electrical
engineering. Mechatronic concepts are used in the majority of electro-
mechanical systems.[36] Typical electro-mechanical sensors used in mechatronics
are strain gauges, thermocouples, and pressure transducers.
**** Nanotechnology[edit] ****
Main article: Nanotechnology
At the smallest scales, mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnologyâone
speculative goal of which is to create a molecular_assembler to build molecules
and materials via mechanosynthesis. For now that goal remains within
exploratory_engineering. Areas of current mechanical engineering research in
nanotechnology include nanofilters,[37] nanofilms,[38] and nanostructures,[39]
among others.
See also: Picotechnology
**** Finite element analysis[edit] ****
Main article: Finite_element_analysis
Finite Element Analysis is a computational tool used to estimate stress,
strain, and deflection of solid bodies. It uses a mesh setup with user-defined
sizes to measure physical quantities at a node. The more nodes there are, the
higher the precision.[40] This field is not new, as the basis of Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) or Finite Element Method (FEM) dates back to 1941. But the
evolution of computers has made FEA/FEM a viable option for analysis of
structural problems. Many commercial codes such as NASTRAN, ANSYS, and ABAQUS
are widely used in industry for research and the design of components. Some 3D
modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules. In the recent times,
cloud simulation platforms like SimScale are becoming more common.
Other techniques such as finite difference method (FDM) and finite-volume
method (FVM) are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer,
fluid flows, fluid surface interaction, etc.
**** Biomechanics[edit] ****
Main article: Biomechanics
Biomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems,
such as humans, animals, plants, organs, and cells.[41] Biomechanics also aids
in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans. Biomechanics is
closely related to engineering, because it often uses traditional engineering
sciences to analyze biological systems. Some simple applications of Newtonian
mechanics and/or materials_sciences can supply correct approximations to the
mechanics of many biological systems.
In the past decade, reverse engineering of materials found in nature such as
bone matter has gained funding in academia. The structure of bone matter is
optimized for its purpose of bearing a large amount of compressive stress per
unit weight. [42] The goal is to replace crude steel with bio-material for
structural design.
Over the past decade the Finite_element_method (FEM) has also entered the
Biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of Biomechanics. FEM
has since then established itself as an alternative to in_vivo surgical
assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia. The main advantage of
Computational Biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical
response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.[43] This
has led FE modelling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of
Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy
(e.g. BioSpine).
**** Computational fluid dynamics[edit] ****
Main article: Computational_fluid_dynamics
Computational fluid dynamics, usually abbreviated as CFD, is a branch of fluid
mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze
problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the
calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with
surfaces defined by boundary conditions.[44] With high-speed supercomputers,
better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that
improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as
turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is performed using a wind
tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight
tests.
**** Acoustical engineering[edit] ****
Main article: Acoustical_engineering
Acoustical engineering is one of many other sub-disciplines of mechanical
engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical engineering is the
study of Sound and Vibration. These engineers work effectively to reduce noise
pollution in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing
sources of unwanted noise. The study of acoustics can range from designing a
more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to
enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. Acoustical engineering also
deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.[45]
***** Related fields[edit] *****
Manufacturing_engineering, aerospace_engineering and automotive_engineering are
grouped with mechanical engineering at times. A bachelor's degree in these
areas will typically have a difference of a few specialized classes.
