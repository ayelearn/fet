Heat treating furnace at 1,800 Â°F (980 Â°C)
Heat treating (or heat treatment) is a group of industrial and metalworking
processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a
material. The most common application is metallurgical. Heat treatments are
also used in the manufacture of many other materials, such as glass. Heat
treatment involves the use of heating or chilling, normally to extreme
temperatures, to achieve the desired result such as hardening or softening of a
material. Heat treatment techniques include annealing, case_hardening,
precipitation_strengthening, tempering, carburizing, normalizing and quenching.
It is noteworthy that while the term heat treatment applies only to processes
where the heating and cooling are done for the specific purpose of altering
properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during
other manufacturing processes such as hot forming or welding.

***** Physical processes[edit] *****
Allotropes of iron, showing the differences in lattice structures between alpha
iron (low temperature) and gamma iron (high temperature). The alpha iron has no
spaces for carbon atoms to reside, while the gamma iron is open to free
movement of small carbon atoms.
Metallic materials consist of a microstructure of small crystals called
"grains" or crystallites. The nature of the grains (i.e. grain size and
composition) is one of the most effective factors that can determine the
overall mechanical behavior of the metal. Heat treatment provides an efficient
way to manipulate the properties of the metal by controlling the rate of
diffusion and the rate of cooling within the microstructure. Heat treating is
often used to alter the mechanical properties of a metallic alloy, manipulating
properties such as the hardness, strength, toughness,[1] ductility, and
elasticity.
There are two mechanisms that may change an alloy's properties during heat
treatment: the formation of martensite causes the crystals to deform
intrinsically, and the diffusion mechanism causes changes in the homogeneity of
the alloy.[2]
The crystal structure consists of atoms that are grouped in a very specific
arrangement, called a lattice. In most elements, this order will rearrange
itself, depending on conditions like temperature and pressure. This
rearrangement, called allotropy or polymorphism, may occur several times, at
many different temperatures for a particular metal. In alloys, this
rearrangement may cause an element that will not normally dissolve into the
base metal to suddenly become soluble, while a reversal of the allotropy will
make the elements either partially or completely insoluble.[3]
When in the soluble state, the process of diffusion causes the atoms of the
dissolved element to spread out, attempting to form a homogenous distribution
within the crystals of the base metal. If the alloy is cooled to an insoluble
state, the atoms of the dissolved constituents (solutes) may migrate out of the
solution. This type of diffusion, called precipitation, leads to nucleation,
where the migrating atoms group together at the grain-boundaries. This forms a
microstructure generally consisting of two or more distinct phases.[4] For
instance, steel that has been heated above the austenizing temperature (red to
orange-hot, or around 1,500 Â°F (820 Â°C) to 1,600 Â°F (870 Â°C) depending on
carbon content), and then cooled slowly, forms a laminated structure composed
of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite, becoming soft pearlite.[5]
After heating the steel to the austenite phase and then quenching it in water,
the microstructure will be in the martensitic phase. This is due to the fact
that the steel will change from the austenite phase to the martensite phase
after quenching. Some pearlite or ferrite may be present if the quench did not
rapidly cool off all the steel.[4]
Unlike iron-based alloys, most heat treatable alloys do not experience a
ferrite transformation. In these alloys, the nucleation at the grain-boundaries
often reinforces the structure of the crystal matrix. These metals harden by
precipitation. Typically a slow process, depending on temperature, this is
often referred to as "age hardening".[6]
Many metals and non-metals exhibit a martensite transformation when cooled
quickly(with external media like oil,polymer,water etc.). When a metal is
cooled very quickly, the insoluble atoms may not be able to migrate out of the
solution in time. This is called a "diffusionless_transformation." When the
crystal matrix changes to its low temperature arrangement, the atoms of the
solute become trapped within the lattice. The trapped atoms prevent the crystal
matrix from completely changing into its low temperature allotrope, creating
shearing stresses within the lattice. When some alloys are cooled quickly, such
as steel, the martensite transformation hardens the metal, while in others,
like aluminum, the alloy becomes softer.[7][8]
***** Effects of composition[edit] *****
Phase diagram of an iron-carbon alloying system. Phase changes occur at
different temperatures (vertical axis) for different compositions (horizontal
axis). The dotted lines mark the eutectoid (A) and eutectic (B) compositions.
The specific composition of an alloy system will usually have a great effect on
the results of heat treating. If the percentage of each constituent is just
right, the alloy will form a single, continuous microstructure upon cooling.
Such a mixture is said to be eutectoid. However, If the percentage of the
solutes varies from the eutectoid mixture, two or more different
microstructures will usually form simultaneously. A hypoeutectoid solution
contains less of the solute than the eutectoid mix, while a hypereutectoid
solution contains more.[9]
**** Eutectoid alloys[edit] ****
A eutectoid (eutectic-like) alloy is similar in behavior to a eutectic_alloy. A
eutectic alloy is characterized by having a single melting_point. This melting
point is lower than that of any of the constituents, and no change in the
mixture will lower the melting point any further. When a molten eutectic alloy
is cooled, all of the constituents will crystallize into their respective
phases at the same temperature.
A eutectoid alloy is similar, but the phase change occurs, not from a liquid,
but from a solid_solution. Upon cooling a eutectoid alloy from the solution
temperature, the constituents will separate into different crystal_phases,
forming a single microstructure. A eutectoid steel, for example, contains 0.77%
carbon. Upon cooling slowly, the solution of iron and carbon (a single phase
called austenite) will separate into platelets of the phases ferrite and
cementite. This forms a layered microstructure called pearlite.
Since pearlite is harder than iron, the degree of softness achievable is
typically limited to that produced by the pearlite. Similarly, the
hardenability is limited by the continuous martensitic microstructure formed
when cooled very fast.[10]
**** Hypoeutectoid alloys[edit] ****
A hypoeutectic alloy has two separate melting points. Both are above the
eutectic melting point for the system, but are below the melting points of any
constituent forming the system. Between these two melting points, the alloy
will exist as part solid and part liquid. The constituent with the lower
melting point will solidify first. When completely solidified, a hypoeutectic
alloy will often be in solid solution.
Similarly, a hypoeutectoid alloy has two critical temperatures, called
"arrests." Between these two temperatures, the alloy will exist partly as the
solution and partly as a separate crystallizing phase, called the "proeutectoid
phase." These two temperatures are called the upper (A3) and lower (A1)
transformation temperatures. As the solution cools from the upper
transformation temperature toward an insoluble state, the excess base metal
will often be forced to "crystallize-out," becoming the proeutectoid. This will
occur until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level,
which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.
A hypoeutectoid steel contains less than 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling a
hypoeutectoid steel from the austenite transformation temperature, small
islands of proeutectoid-ferrite will form. These will continue to grow and the
carbon will recede until the eutectoid concentration in the rest of the steel
is reached. This eutectoid mixture will then crystallize as a microstructure of
pearlite. Since ferrite is softer than pearlite, the two microstructures
combine to increase the ductility of the alloy. Consequently, the hardenability
of the alloy is lowered.[11]
**** Hypereutectoid alloys[edit] ****
A hypereutectic alloy also has different melting points. However, between these
points, it is the constituent with the higher melting point that will be solid.
Similarly, a hypereutectoid alloy has two critical temperatures. When cooling a
hypereutectoid alloy from the upper transformation temperature, it will usually
be the excess solutes that crystallize-out first, forming the proeutectoid.
This continues until the concentration in the remaining alloy becomes
eutectoid, which then crystallizes into a separate microstructure.
A hypereutectoid steel contains more than 0.77% carbon. When slowly cooling a
hypereutectoid steel, the cementite will begin to crystallize first. When the
remaining steel becomes eutectoid in composition, it will crystallize into
pearlite. Since cementite is much harder than pearlite, the alloy has greater
hardenability at a cost in the ductility.[9][11]
***** Effects of time and temperature[edit] *****
Time-temperature transformation (TTT) diagram for steel. The red curves
represent different cooling rates (velocity) when cooled from the upper
critical (A3) temperature. V1 produces martensite. V2 has pearlite mixed with
martensite, V3 produces bainite, along with pearlite and matensite.
Proper heat treating requires precise control over temperature, time held at a
certain temperature and cooling rate.[12]
With the exception of stress-relieving, tempering, and aging, most heat
treatments begin by heating an alloy beyond a certain transformation, or arrest
(A), temperature. This temperature is referred to as an "arrest" because at the
A temperature the metal experiences a period of hysteresis. At this point, all
of the heat energy is used to cause the crystal change, so the temperature
stops rising for a short time (arrests) and then continues climbing once the
change is complete.[13] Therefore, the alloy must be heated above the critical
temperature for a transformation to occur. The alloy will usually be held at
this temperature long enough for the heat to completely penetrate the alloy,
thereby bringing it into a complete solid solution. Iron, for example, has four
critical-temperatures, depending on carbon content. Pure iron in its alpha
(room temperature) state changes to nonmagnetic gamma-iron at its A2
temperature, and weldable delta-iron at its A4 temperature. However, as carbon
is added, becoming steel, the A2 temperature splits into the A3 temperature,
also called the austenizing temperature (all phases become austenite, a
solution of gamma iron and carbon) and its A1 temperature (austenite changes
into pearlite upon cooling). Between these upper and lower temperatures the
proeutectoid phase forms upon cooling.
Because a smaller grain size usually enhances mechanical properties, such as
toughness, shear_strength and tensile_strength, these metals are often heated
to a temperature that is just above the upper critical-temperature, in order to
prevent the grains of solution from growing too large. For instance, when steel
is heated above the upper critical-temperature, small grains of austenite form.
These grow larger as temperature is increased. When cooled very quickly, during
a martensite transformation, the austenite grain-size directly affects the
martensitic grain-size. Larger grains have large grain-boundaries, which serve
as weak spots in the structure. The grain size is usually controlled to reduce
the probability of breakage.[14]
The diffusion transformation is very time-dependent. Cooling a metal will
usually suppress the precipitation to a much lower temperature. Austenite, for
example, usually only exists above the upper critical temperature. However, if
the austenite is cooled quickly enough, the transformation may be suppressed
for hundreds of degrees below the lower critical temperature. Such austenite is
highly unstable and, if given enough time, will precipitate into various
microstructures of ferrite and cementite. The cooling rate can be used to
control the rate of grain growth or can even be used to produce partially
martensitic microstructures.[15] However, the martensite transformation is
time-independent. If the alloy is cooled to the martensite transformation (Ms)
temperature before other microstructures can fully form, the transformation
will usually occur at just under the speed of sound.[16]
When austenite is cooled slow enough that a martensite transformation does not
occur, the austenite grain size will have an effect on the rate of nucleation,
but it is generally temperature and the rate of cooling that controls the grain
size and microstructure. When austenite is cooled extremely slow, it will form
large ferrite crystals filled with spherical inclusions of cementite. This
microstructure is referred to as "sphereoidite." If cooled a little faster,
then coarse pearlite will form. Even faster, and fine pearlite will form. If
cooled even faster, bainite will form. Similarly, these microstructures will
also form if cooled to a specific temperature and then held there for a certain
time.[17]
Most non-ferrous alloys are also heated in order to form a solution. Most
often, these are then cooled very quickly to produce a martensite
transformation, putting the solution into a supersaturated state. The alloy,
being in a much softer state, may then be cold_worked. This causes work
hardening that increases the strength and hardness of the alloy. Moreover, the
defects caused by plastic_deformation tend to speed up precipitation,
increasing the hardness beyond what is normal for the alloy. Even if not cold
worked, the solutes in these alloys will usually precipitate, although the
process may take much longer. Sometimes these metals are then heated to a
temperature that is below the lower critical (A1) temperature, preventing
recrystallization, in order to speed-up the precipitation.[18][19][20]
***** Techniques[edit] *****
Steel castings after undergoing 12-hour 1,200 Â°C (2,190 Â°F) heat treatment.
Complex heat treating schedules, or "cycles," are often devised by
metallurgists to optimize an alloy's mechanical properties. In the aerospace
industry, a superalloy may undergo five or more different heat treating
operations to develop the desired properties. This can lead to quality problems
depending on the accuracy of the furnace's temperature controls and timer.
These operations can usually be divided into several basic techniques.
**** Annealing[edit] ****
Main article: Annealing_(metallurgy)
Annealing consists of heating a metal to a specific temperature and then
cooling at a rate that will produce a refined microstructure, either fully or
partially separating the constituents. The rate of cooling is generally slow.
Annealing is most often used to soften a metal for cold working, to improve
machinability, or to enhance properties like electrical_conductivity.
In ferrous alloys, annealing is usually accomplished by heating the metal
beyond the upper critical temperature and then cooling very slowly, resulting
in the formation of pearlite. In both pure metals and many alloys that cannot
be heat treated, annealing is used to remove the hardness caused by cold
working. The metal is heated to a temperature where recrystallization can
occur, thereby repairing the defects caused by plastic deformation. In these
metals, the rate of cooling will usually have little effect. Most non-ferrous
alloys that are heat-treatable are also annealed to relieve the hardness of
cold working. These may be slowly cooled to allow full precipitation of the
constituents and produce a refined microstructure.
Ferrous alloys are usually either "full annealed" or "process annealed." Full
annealing requires very slow cooling rates, in order to form coarse pearlite.
In process annealing, the cooling rate may be faster; up to, and including
normalizing. The main goal of process annealing is to produce a uniform
microstructure. Non-ferrous alloys are often subjected to a variety of
annealing techniques, including "recrystallization annealing," "partial
annealing," "full annealing," and "final annealing." Not all annealing
techniques involve recrystallization, such as stress relieving.[21]
*** Normalizing[edit] ***
Normalizing is a technique used to provide uniformity in grain size and
composition (equiaxing) throughout an alloy. The term is often used for ferrous
alloys that have been austenized and then cooled in open air.[21] Normalizing
not only produces pearlite, but also martensite and sometimes bainite, which
gives harder and stronger steel, but with less ductility for the same
composition than full annealing.
*** Stress relieving[edit] ***
Stress relieving is a technique to remove or reduce the internal stresses
created in a metal. These stresses may be caused in a number of ways, ranging
from cold working to non-uniform cooling. Stress relieving is usually
accomplished by heating a metal below the lower critical temperature and then
cooling uniformly.[21] Stress relieving is commonly used on items like air
tanks, boilers and other pressure_vessels, to remove all stresses created
during the welding process.[22]
**** Aging[edit] ****
Main article: Precipitation_hardening
Some metals are classified as precipitation hardening metals. When a
precipitation hardening alloy is quenched, its alloying elements will be
trapped in solution, resulting in a soft metal. Aging a "solutionized" metal
will allow the alloying elements to diffuse through the microstructure and form
intermetallic particles. These intermetallic particles will nucleate and fall
out of solution and act as a reinforcing phase, thereby increasing the strength
of the alloy. Alloys may age "naturally" meaning that the precipitates form at
room temperature, or they may age "artificially" when precipitates only form at
elevated temperatures. In some applications, naturally aging alloys may be
stored in a freezer to prevent hardening until after further operations -
assembly of rivets, for example, may be easier with a softer part.
Examples of precipitation hardening alloys include 2000 series, 6000 series,
and 7000 series aluminium_alloy, as well as some superalloys and some stainless
steels. Steels that harden by aging are typically referred to as maraging
steels, from a combination of the term "martensite aging."[21]
**** Quenching[edit] ****
Main article: Quenching
Quenching is a process of cooling a metal at a rapid rate. This is most often
done to produce a martensite transformation. In ferrous alloys, this will often
produce a harder metal, while non-ferrous alloys will usually become softer
than normal.
To harden by quenching, a metal (usually steel or cast iron) must be heated
above the upper critical temperature and then quickly cooled. Depending on the
alloy and other considerations (such as concern for maximum hardness vs.
cracking and distortion), cooling may be done with forced air or other gases,
(such as nitrogen). Liquids may be used, due to their better thermal
conductivity, such as oil, water, a polymer dissolved in water, or a brine.
Upon being rapidly cooled, a portion of austenite (dependent on alloy
composition) will transform to martensite, a hard, brittle crystalline
structure. The quenched hardness of a metal depends on its chemical composition
and quenching method. Cooling speeds, from fastest to slowest, go from brine,
polymer (i.e. mixtures of water + glycol polymers), fresh water, oil, and
forced air. However, quenching a certain steel too fast can result in cracking,
which is why high-tensile steels such as AISI 4140 should be quenched in oil,
tool_steels such as ISO_1.2767 or H13 hot work tool steel should be quenched in
forced air, and low alloy or medium-tensile steels such as XK1320 or AISI 1040
should be quenched in brine.
Some Beta titanium based alloys have also shown similar trends of increased
strength through rapid cooling.[23] However, most non-ferrous metals, like
alloys of copper, aluminum, or nickel, and some high alloy steels such as
austenitic stainless steel (304, 316), produce an opposite effect when these
are quenched: they soften. Austenitic stainless steels must be quenched to
become fully corrosion resistant, as they work-harden significantly.[21]
**** Tempering[edit] ****
Main article: Tempering_(metallurgy)
Untempered martensitic steel, while very hard, is too brittle to be useful for
most applications. A method for alleviating this problem is called tempering.
Most applications require that quenched parts be tempered. Tempering consists
of heating steel below the lower critical temperature, (often from 400 to 1105
ËF or 205 to 595 ËC, depending on the desired results), to impart some
toughness. Higher tempering temperatures (may be up to 1,300 ËF or 700 ËC,
depending on the alloy and application) are sometimes used to impart further
ductility, although some yield strength is lost.
Tempering may also be performed on normalized steels. Other methods of
tempering consist of quenching to a specific temperature, which is above the
martensite start temperature, and then holding it there until pure bainite can
form or internal stresses can be relieved. These include austempering and
martempering.[21]
*** Tempering colors[edit] ***
Steel that has been freshly ground or polished will form oxide layers when
heated. At a very specific temperature, the iron_oxide will form a layer with a
very specific thickness, causing thin-film_interference. This causes colors to
appear on the surface of the steel. As temperature is increased, the iron oxide
layer grows in thickness, changing the color.[24] These colors, called
tempering colors, have been used for centuries to gauge the temperature of the
metal.[25]
Tempering colors of steel
    * 350ËF (176ËC), light yellowish
    * 400ËF (204ËC), light-straw
    * 440ËF (226ËC), dark-straw
    * 500ËF (260ËC), brown
    * 540ËF (282ËC), purple
    * 590ËF (310ËC), deep blue
    * 640ËF (337ËC), light blue[25]
The tempering colors can be used to judge the final properties of the tempered
steel. Very hard tools are often tempered in the light to dark straw range,
whereas springs are often tempered to the blue. However, the final hardness of
the tempered steel will vary, depending on the composition of the steel.
Higher-carbon tool_steel will remain much harder after tempering than spring
steel (of slightly less carbon) when tempered at the same temperature. The
oxide film will also increase in thickness over time. Therefore, steel that has
been held at 400ËF for a very long time may turn brown or purple, even though
the temperature never exceeded that needed to produce a light straw color.
Other factors affecting the final outcome are oil films on the surface and the
type of heat source used.[25]
**** Selective heat treating[edit] ****
Main article: Differential_heat_treatment
Many heat treating methods have been developed to alter the properties of only
a portion of an object. These tend to consist of either cooling different areas
of an alloy at different rates, by quickly heating in a localized area and then
quenching, by thermochemical diffusion, or by tempering different areas of an
object at different temperatures, such as in differential_tempering.
*** Differential hardening[edit] ***
Main article: Differential_hardening
A differentially hardened katana. The bright, wavy line following the hamon,
called the nioi, separates the martensitic edge from the pearlitic back. The
inset shows a close-up of the nioi, which is made up of individual martensite
grains (niye) surrounded by pearlite. The wood-grain appearance comes from
layers of different composition.
Some techniques allow different areas of a single object to receive different
heat treatments. This is called differential_hardening. It is common in high
quality knives and swords. The Chinese jian is one of the earliest known
examples of this, and the Japanese katana may be the most widely known. The
Nepalese Khukuri is another example. This technique uses an insulating layer,
like layers of clay, to cover the areas that are to remain soft. The areas to
be hardened are left exposed, allowing only certain parts of the steel to fully
harden when quenched.
*** Flame hardening[edit] ***
Main article: Surface_hardening
Flame hardening is used to harden only a portion of a metal. Unlike
differential hardening, where the entire piece is heated and then cooled at
different rates, in flame hardening, only a portion of the metal is heated
before quenching. This is usually easier than differential hardening, but often
produces an extremely brittle zone between the heated metal and the unheated
metal, as cooling at the edge of this heat-affected_zone is extremely rapid.
*** Induction hardening[edit] ***
Main article: Induction_hardening
Induction hardening is a surface_hardening technique in which the surface of
the metal is heated very quickly, using a no-contact method of induction
heating. The alloy is then quenched, producing a martensite transformation at
the surface while leaving the underlying metal unchanged. This creates a very
hard, wear resistant surface while maintaining the proper toughness in the
majority of the object. Crankshaft journals are a good example of an induction
hardened surface.[26]
*** Case hardening[edit] ***
Main article: Case_hardening
Case hardening is a thermochemical diffusion process in which an alloying
element, most commonly carbon or nitrogen, diffuses into the surface of a
monolithic metal. The resulting interstitial solid solution is harder than the
base material, which improves wear resistance without sacrificing toughness.
[21]
Laser surface engineering is a surface treatment with high versatility,
selectivity and novel properties. Since the cooling rate is very high in laser
treatment, metastable even metallic glass can be obtained by this method.
**** Cold and cryogenic treating[edit] ****
Main article: Cryogenic_treatment
Although quenching steel causes the austenite to transform into martensite, all
of the austenite usually does not transform. Some austenite crystals will
remain unchanged even after quenching below the martensite finish (Mf)
temperature. Further transformation of the austenite into martensite can be
induced by slowly cooling the metal to extremely low temperatures. Cold
treating generally consists of cooling the steel to around -115 ËF (-81 ËC),
but does not eliminate all of the austenite. Cryogenic treating usually
consists of cooling to much lower temperatures, often in the range of -315 ËF
(-192 ËC), to transform most of the austenite into martensite.
Cold and cryogenic treatments are typically done immediately after quenching,
before any tempering, and will increase the hardness, wear resistance, and
reduce the internal stresses in the metal but, because it is really an
extension of the quenching process, it may increase the chances of cracking
during the procedure. The process is often used for tools, bearings, or other
items that require good wear resistance. However, it is usually only effective
in high-carbon or high-alloy steels in which more than 10% austenite is
retained after quenching.[27][28]
**** Decarburization[edit] ****
The heating of steel is sometimes used as a method to alter the carbon content.
When steel is heated in an oxidizing environment, the oxygen combines with the
iron to form an iron-oxide layer, which protects the steel from
decarburization. When the steel turns to austenite, however, the oxygen
combines with iron to form slag, which provides no protection from
decarburization. The formation of slag and scale actually increases
decarburization, because the iron oxide keeps oxygen in contact with the
decarburization zone even after the steel is moved into an oxygen-free
environment, such as the coals of a forge. Thus, the carbon atoms begin
combining with the surrounding scale and slag to form both carbon_monoxide and
carbon_dioxide, which is released into the air.
Steel contains a relatively small percentage of carbon, which can migrate
freely within the gamma iron. When austenized steel is exposed to air for long
periods of time, the carbon content in the steel can be lowered. This is the
opposite from what happens when steel is heated in a reducing_environment, in
which carbon slowly diffuses further into the metal. In an oxidizing
environment, the carbon can readily diffuse outwardly, so austenized steel is
very susceptible to decarburization. This is often used for cast steel, where a
high carbon-content is needed for casting, but a lower carbon-content is
desired in the finished product. It is often used on cast-irons to produce
malleable_cast_iron, in a process called "white tempering." This tendency to
decarburize is often a problem in other operations, such as blacksmithing,
where it becomes more desirable to austenize the steel for the shortest amount
of time possible to prevent too much decarburization.[29]
***** Specification[edit] *****
Usually the end condition is specified instead of the process used in heat
treatment.[30]
**** Case hardening[edit] ****
A modern, fully computerised case hardening furnace.
Case hardening is specified by hardness and case depth. The case depth can be
specified in two ways: total case depth or effective case depth. The total case
depth is the true depth of the case. For most alloys, the effective case depth
is the depth of the case that has a hardness equivalent of HRC50; however, some
alloys specify a different hardness (40-60 HRC) at effective case depth; this
is checked on a Tukon_microhardness_tester. This value can be roughly
approximated as 65% of the total case depth; however the chemical composition
and hardenability can affect this approximation. If neither type of case depth
is specified the total case depth is assumed.[30]
For case hardened parts the specification should have a tolerance of at least
Â±0.005 in (0.13 mm). If the part is to be ground after heat treatment, the
case depth is assumed to be after grinding.[30]
The Rockwell_hardness scale used for the specification depends on the depth of
the total case depth, as shown in the table below. Usually hardness is measured
on the Rockwell "C" scale, but the load used on the scale will penetrate
through the case if the case is less than 0.030 in (0.76 mm). Using Rockwell
"C" for a thinner case will result in a false reading.[30]
  Rockwell scale required for various case
 ________________depths[30]________________
|Total_case_depth,_min._[in]|Rockwell_scale|
|0.030______________________|C_____________|
|0.024______________________|A_____________|
|0.021______________________|45N___________|
|0.018______________________|30N___________|
|0.015______________________|15N___________|
|Less_than_0.015____________|"File_hard"___|
For cases that are less than 0.015 in (0.38 mm) thick a Rockwell scale cannot
reliably be used, so file hard is specified instead.[30] File hard is
approximately equivalent to 58 HRC.[31]
When specifying the hardness either a range should be given or the minimum
hardness specified. If a range is specified at least 5 points should be given.
[30]
**** Through hardening[edit] ****
Only hardness is listed for through hardening. It is usually in the form of HRC
with at least a five-point range.[30]
**** Annealing[edit] ****
The hardness for an annealing process is usually listed on the HRB scale as a
maximum value.[30] It is a process to refine grain size, improve strength,
remove residual stress and affect the electromagnetic properties...
***** Furnace types[edit] *****
Furnaces used for heat treatment can be split into two broad categories: batch
furnaces and continuous furnaces. Batch furnaces are usually manually loaded
and unloaded, whereas continuous furnaces have an automatic conveying system to
provide a constant load into the furnace chamber.[32]
**** Batch furnaces[edit] ****
Batch systems usually consist of an insulated chamber with a steel shell, a
heating_system, and an access door to the chamber.[32]
*** Box-type furnace[edit] ***
Many basic box type furnaces have been upgraded to a semi-continuous batch
furnace with the addition of integrated quench tanks and slow-cool chambers.
These upgraded furnaces are a very commonly used piece of equipment for heat-
treating.[32]
*** Car-type furnace[edit] ***
Also known as a "bogie hearth", the car furnace is an extremely large batch
furnace. The floor is constructed as an insulated movable car that is moved in
and out of the furnace for loading and unloading. The car is usually sealed
using sand seals or solid seals when in position. Due to the difficulty in
getting a sufficient seal, car furnaces are usually used for non-atmosphere
processes.
*** Elevator-type furnace[edit] ***
Fluidised bed heat treatment line
Similar in type to the car furnace, except that the car and hearth are rolled
into position beneath the furnace and raised by means of a motor driven
mechanism, elevator furnaces can handle large heavy loads and often eliminate
the need for any external cranes and transfer mechanisms.[32]
*** Bell-type furnace[edit] ***
Bell furnaces have removable covers called bells, which are lowered over the
load and hearth by crane. An inner bell is placed over the hearth and sealed to
supply a protective atmosphere. An outer bell is lowered to provide the heat
supply.[32]
*** Pit furnaces[edit] ***
Furnaces which are constructed in a pit and extend to floor level or slightly
above are called pit furnaces. Workpieces can be suspended from fixtures, held
in baskets or placed on bases in the furnace. Pit furnaces are suited to
heating long tubes, shafts and rods by holding them in a vertical position.
This manner of loading provides minimal distortion.[32]
*** Salt bath furnaces[edit] ***
Salt baths are used in a wide variety of heat treatment processes including
neutral hardening, liquid_carburising, liquid_nitriding, austempering,
martempering and tempering.
Parts are loaded into a pot of molten salt where they are heated by conduction,
giving a very readily available source of heat. The core temperature of a part
rises in temperature at approximately the same rate as its surface in a salt
bath.[32]
Salt baths utilize a variety of salts for heat treatment, with cyanide salts
being the most extensively used. Concerns about associated occupation health
and safety, and expensive waste management and disposal due to their
environmental effects has made the use of salt baths less attractive in recent
years. Consequently, many salt baths are being replaced by more environmentally
friendly fluidised bed furnaces.[33]
*** Fluidised bed furnaces[edit] ***
A fluidised_bed consists of a cylindrical retort made from high temperature
alloy, filled with sand-like aluminium oxide particulate. Gas (air or nitrogen)
is bubbled through the oxide and the sand moves in such a way that is exhibits
fluid-like behaviour, hence the term fluidised. The solid-solid contact of the
oxide gives very high thermal_conductivity and excellent temperature uniformity
throughout the furnace, comparable to those seen in a salt bath.[32]
