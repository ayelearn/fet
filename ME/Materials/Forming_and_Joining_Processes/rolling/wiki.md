The animation illustrates rolling motion of a wheel as a superposition of two
motions: translation with respect to the surface, and rotation around its own
axis.
Rolling is a type_of_motion that combines rotation (commonly, of an axially
symmetric object) and translation of that object with respect to a surface
(either one or the other moves), such that, if ideal conditions exist, the two
are in contact with each other without sliding.
Rolling where there is no sliding is referred to as pure rolling. By
definition, there is no sliding when there is a frame_of_reference in which all
points of contact on the rolling object have the same velocity as their
counterparts on the surface on which the object rolls; in particular, for a
frame of reference in which the rolling plane is at rest (see animation), the
instantaneous velocity of all the points of contact (e.g., a generating line
segment of a cylinder) of the rolling object is zero.
In practice, due to small deformations near the contact area, some sliding and
energy dissipation occurs. Nevertheless, the resulting rolling_resistance is
much lower than sliding_friction, and thus, rolling objects, typically require
much less energy to be moved than sliding ones. As a result, such objects will
more easily move, if they experience a force with a component along the
surface, for instance gravity on a tilted surface, wind, pushing, pulling, or
torque from an engine. Unlike cylindrical axially symmetric objects, the
rolling_motion_of_a_cone is such that while rolling on a flat surface, its
center_of_gravity performs a circular_motion, rather than a linear_motion.
Rolling objects are not necessarily axially-symmetrical. Two well known non-
axially-symmetrical rollers are the Reuleaux_triangle and the Meissner_bodies.
The oloid and the sphericon are members of a special family of developable
rollers that develop their entire surface when rolling down a flat plane.
Objects with corners, such as dice, roll by successive rotations about the edge
or corner which is in contact with the surface. The construction of a specific
surface allows even a perfect square_wheel to roll with its centroid at
constant height above a reference plane.

***** Applications[edit] *****
Most land_vehicles use wheels and therefore rolling for displacement. Slip
should be kept to a minimum (approximating pure rolling), otherwise loss of
control and an accident may result. This may happen when the road is covered in
snow, sand, or oil, when taking a turn at high speed or attempting to brake or
accelerate suddenly.
One of the most practical applications of rolling objects is the use of
rolling-element_bearings, such as ball_bearings, in rotating devices. Made of
metal, the rolling elements are usually encased between two rings that can
rotate independently of each other. In most mechanisms, the inner ring is
attached to a stationary shaft (or axle). Thus, while the inner ring is
stationary, the outer ring is free to move with very little friction. This is
the basis for which almost all motors (such as those found in ceiling fans,
cars, drills, etc.) rely on to operate. The amount of friction on the
mechanism's parts depends on the quality of the ball bearings and how much
lubrication is in the mechanism.
Rolling objects are also frequently used as tools for transportation. One of
the most basic ways is by placing a (usually flat) object on a series of lined-
up rollers, or wheels. The object on the wheels can be moved along them in a
straight line, as long as the wheels are continuously replaced in the front
(see history_of_bearings). This method of primitive transportation is efficient
when no other machinery is available. Today, the most practical application of
objects on wheels are cars, trains, and other human transportation vehicles.
***** Physics of simple rolling[edit] *****
The velocities of the points of a rolling object are equal to those of rotation
around the point of contact.
The simplest case of rolling is that of an axially symmetrical object rolling
without slip along a flat surface with its axis parallel to the surface (or
equivalently: perpendicular to the surface normal).
The trajectory of any point is a trochoid; in particular, the trajectory of any
point in the object axis is a line, while the trajectory of any point in the
object rim is a cycloid.
The velocity of any point in the rolling object is given by      v  =  &#x03C9;
&#x00D7;  r    {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times
\mathbf {r} }  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times
\mathbf {r} }], where      r    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }  [\mathbf {r} ] is
the displacement between the particle and the rolling object's contact point
(or line) with the surface, and      &#x03C9;    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol
{\omega }}}  [{\boldsymbol {\omega }}] is the angular_velocity_vector. Thus,
despite that rolling is different from rotation_around_a_fixed_axis, the
instantaneous velocity of all particles of the rolling object is the same as if
it was rotating around an axis that passes through the point of contact with
the same angular velocity.
Any point in the rolling object farther from the axis than the point of contact
will temporarily move opposite to the direction of the overall motion when it
is below the level of the rolling surface (for example, any point in the part
of the flange of a train wheel that is below the rail).
**** Energy[edit] ****
Since kinetic_energy is entirely a function of an object mass and velocity, the
above result may be used with the parallel_axis_theorem to obtain the kinetic
energy associated with simple rolling
          K  rolling   =  K  translation   +  K  rotation     {\displaystyle K_
      {\text{rolling}}=K_{\text{translation}}+K_{\text{rotation}}}  [K_{{\text
      {rolling}}}=K_{{\text{translation}}}+K_{{\text{rotation}}}]
Derivation
Further information: Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis
Let     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] be the distance between the center of mass
and the point of contact; when the surface is flat, this is the radius of the
object around its widest cross section. Since the center of mass has an
immediate velocity as if it was rotating around the point of contact, its
velocity is      v  c.o.m.   = r &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle v_{\text
{c.o.m.}}=r\omega }  [v_{{\text{c.o.m.}}}=r\omega ]. Due to symmetry, the
object center of mass is a point in its axis. Let      I  rotation
{\displaystyle I_{\text{rotation}}}  [I_{{\text{rotation}}}] be inertia of pure
rotation around the axis of symmetry, then according to the parallel axis
theorem, the rotational_inertia associated with rolling is      I  rolling   =
m  r  2   +  I  rotation     {\displaystyle I_{\text{rolling}}=mr^{2}+I_{\text
{rotation}}}  [I_{{\text{rolling}}}=mr^{2}+I_{{\text{rotation}}}] (same as the
rotational inertia of pure rotation around the point of contact). Using the
general formula for kinetic energy of rotation, we have:
              K  rolling      =   1 2    I  rolling    &#x03C9;  2         =
      1 2   m  r  2    &#x03C9;  2   +   1 2    I  rotation    &#x03C9;  2
      =   1 2   m ( r &#x03C9;  )  2   +   1 2    I  rotation    &#x03C9;  2
      =   1 2   m  v  c.o.m.   2   +   1 2    I  rotation    &#x03C9;  2
      =  K  translation   +  K  rotation         {\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}K_{\text{rolling}}&={\frac {1}{2}}I_{\text{rolling}}\omega ^
      {2}\\&={\frac {1}{2}}mr^{2}\omega ^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}I_{\text

      {\frac {1}{2}}I_{\text{rotation}}\omega ^{2}\\&=K_{\text{translation}}+K_
      {\text{rotation}}\\\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}K_
      {\text{rolling}}&={\frac {1}{2}}I_{\text{rolling}}\omega ^{2}\\&={\frac
      {1}{2}}mr^{2}\omega ^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}I_{\text{rotation}}\omega ^{2}\\&=
      {\frac {1}{2}}m(r\omega )^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}I_{\text{rotation}}\omega ^
      {2}\\&={\frac {1}{2}}mv_{\text{c.o.m.}}^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}I_{\text
      {rotation}}\omega ^{2}\\&=K_{\text{translation}}+K_{\text
      {rotation}}\\\end{aligned}}}]
**** Forces and acceleration[edit] ****
Differentiating the relation between linear and angular velocity,      v
c.o.m.   = r &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle v_{\text{c.o.m.}}=r\omega }  [v_{{\text
{c.o.m.}}}=r\omega ], with respect to time gives a formula relating linear and
angular acceleration     a = r &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle a=r\alpha }
[a=r\alpha ]. Applying Newton's_second_law:
         a =    F  net   m   = r &#x03B1; =    r &#x03C4;  I   .
      {\displaystyle a={\frac {F_{\text{net}}}{m}}=r\alpha ={\frac {r\tau }
      {I}}.}  [{\displaystyle a={\frac {F_{\text{net}}}{m}}=r\alpha ={\frac
      {r\tau }{I}}.}]
It follows that to accelerate the object, both a net force and a torque are
required. When external force with no torque acts on the rolling
objectâsurface system, there will be a tangential force at the point of
contact between the surface and rolling object that provides the required
torque as long as the motion is pure rolling; this force is usually static
friction, for example, between the road and a wheel or between a bowling lane
and a bowling ball. When static friction isn't enough, the friction becomes
dynamic_friction and slipping happens. The tangential force is opposite in
direction to the external force, and therefore partially cancels it. The
resulting net_force and acceleration are:
              F  net      =    F  external    1 +   I  m  r  2         =    F
      external    1 +   (    r  gyr.   r   )   2          a    =    F  external
      m +   I  r  2              {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F_{\text
      {net}}&={\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{1+{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}}}={\frac {F_
      {\text{external}}}{1+\left({\frac {r_{\text{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^{2}}}\\a&=
      {\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{m+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}}}\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F_{\text{net}}&={\frac {F_{\text
      {external}}}{1+{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}}}={\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{1+\left
      ({\frac {r_{\text{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^{2}}}\\a&={\frac {F_{\text
      {external}}}{m+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}}}\end{aligned}}}]
Derivation
Assume that the object experiences an external force      F  external
{\displaystyle F_{\text{external}}}  [F_{{\text{external}}}] which exerts no
torque (it has 0 moment_arm), static friction at the point of contact (     F
friction     {\displaystyle F_{\text{friction}}}  [F_{{{\text{friction}}}}])
provides the torque and the other forces involved cancell.      F  friction
{\displaystyle F_{\text{friction}}}  [F_{{{\text{friction}}}}] is tangential to
the object and surface at the point of contact and opposite in direction to
F  external     {\displaystyle F_{\text{external}}}  [F_{{\text{external}}}].
Using the sign_convention by which this force is positive, the net force is:
          F  net   =  F  external
      &#x2212;  F  friction
      {\displaystyle F_{\text{net}}=F_        ( 1 )   {\displaystyle (1)}  [
      {\text{external}}-F_{\text             (1)]
      {friction}}}  [{\displaystyle F_
      {\text{net}}=F_{\text{external}}-
      F_{\text{friction}}}]
Because there is no slip,     r &#x03B1; = a   {\displaystyle r\alpha =a}
[r\alpha =a] holds. Substituting     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }
[\alpha ] and     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] for the linear and rotational
version of Newton's_second_law, then solving for      F  friction
{\displaystyle F_{\text{friction}}}  [F_{{\text{friction}}}]:
             r   &#x03C4; I      =    F  net   m       r    r  F  friction    I
      =    F  net   m        F  friction      =    I  F  net     m  r  2
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}r{\frac {\tau }{I}}&={\frac {F_{\text
      {net}}}{m}}\\r{\frac {rF_{\text{friction}}}{I}}&={\frac {F_{\text{net}}}
      {m}}\\F_{\text{friction}}&={\frac {IF_{\text{net}}}{mr^{2}}}\\\end
      {aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}r{\frac {\tau }{I}}&={\frac
      {F_{\text{net}}}{m}}\\r{\frac {rF_{\text{friction}}}{I}}&={\frac {F_
      {\text{net}}}{m}}\\F_{\text{friction}}&={\frac {IF_{\text{net}}}{mr^
      {2}}}\\\end{aligned}}}]
Expanding      F  friction     {\displaystyle F_{\text{friction}}}  [F_{{\text
{friction}}}] in     ( 1 )   {\displaystyle (1)}  [(1)]:
              F  net      =  F  external   &#x2212;    I  F  net     m  r  2
      =  F  external   &#x2212;   I  m  r  2       F  net         =    F
      external    1 +   I  m  r  2               {\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}F_{\text{net}}&=F_{\text{external}}-{\frac {IF_{\text{net}}}{mr^
      {2}}}\\&=F_{\text{external}}-{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}F_{\text{net}}\\&={\frac
      {F_{\text{external}}}{1+{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}}}\\\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F_{\text{net}}&=F_{\text{external}}-{\frac
      {IF_{\text{net}}}{mr^{2}}}\\&=F_{\text{external}}-{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}F_
      {\text{net}}\\&={\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{1+{\frac {I}{mr^
      {2}}}}}\\\end{aligned}}}]
The last equality is the first formula for      F  net     {\displaystyle F_
{\text{net}}}  [F_{{\text{net}}}]; using it together with Newton's second law,
then reducing, the formula for     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] is obtained:
             a    =    F  net   m         =    (    F  external    1 +   I  m
      r  2         )  m         =    F  external    m  (  1 +   I  m  r  2
      )           =    F  external    m +   I  r  2              {\displaystyle
      {\begin{aligned}a&={\frac {F_{\text{net}}}{m}}\\&={\frac {\left({\frac
      {F_{\text{external}}}{1+{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}}}\right)}{m}}\\&={\frac {F_
      {\text{external}}}{m\left(1+{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}\right)}}\\&={\frac {F_
      {\text{external}}}{m+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}}}\\\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a&={\frac {F_{\text{net}}}{m}}\\&={\frac
      {\left({\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{1+{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}}}\right)}
      {m}}\\&={\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{m\left(1+{\frac {I}{mr^
      {2}}}\right)}}\\&={\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{m+{\frac {I}{r^
      {2}}}}}\\\end{aligned}}}]
The radius_of_gyration can be incorporated in the first formula for      F  net
{\displaystyle F_{\text{net}}}  [F_{{\text{net}}}] as follows:
              r  gyr.      =    I m         r  gyr.   2      =   I m         I
      m  r  2         =    (   I m   )   r  2           =    r  gyr.   2    r
      2           =   (    r  gyr.   r   )   2         {\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}r_{\text{gyr.}}&={\sqrt {\frac {I}{m}}}\\r_{\text{gyr.}}^{2}&=
      {\frac {I}{m}}\\{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}&={\frac {\left({\frac {I}{m}}\right)}
      {r^{2}}}\\&={\frac {r_{\text{gyr.}}^{2}}{r^{2}}}\\&=\left({\frac {r_
      {\text{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^{2}\\\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}r_{\text{gyr.}}&={\sqrt {\frac {I}{m}}}\\r_{\text{gyr.}}^{2}&=
      {\frac {I}{m}}\\{\frac {I}{mr^{2}}}&={\frac {\left({\frac {I}{m}}\right)}
      {r^{2}}}\\&={\frac {r_{\text{gyr.}}^{2}}{r^{2}}}\\&=\left({\frac {r_
      {\text{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^{2}\\\end{aligned}}}]
Substituting the latest equality above in the first formula for      F  net
{\displaystyle F_{\text{net}}}  [F_{{\text{net}}}] the second formula for it:
          F  net   =    F  external    1 +   (    r  gyr.   r   )   2
      {\displaystyle F_{\text{net}}={\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{1+\left({\frac
      {r_{\text{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle F_{\text{net}}=
      {\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{1+\left({\frac {r_{\text{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^
      {2}}}}]
      I  r  2        {\displaystyle {\tfrac {I}{r^{2}}}}  [{\tfrac  {I}{r^
{2}}}] has dimension of mass, and it is the mass that would have a rotational
inertia     I   {\displaystyle I}  [I] at distance     r   {\displaystyle r}
[r] from an axis of rotation. Therefore, the term        I  r  2
{\displaystyle {\tfrac {I}{r^{2}}}}  [{\tfrac  {I}{r^{2}}}] may be thought of
as the mass with linear inertia equivalent to the rolling object rotational
inertia (around its center of mass). The action of the external force upon an
object in simple rotation may be conceptualized as accelerating the sum of the
real mass and the virtual mass that represents the rotational inertia, which is
m +    I  r  2        {\displaystyle m+{\tfrac {I}{r^{2}}}}  [m+{\tfrac  {I}{r^
{2}}}]. Since the work done by the external force is split between overcoming
the translational and rotational inertia, the external force results in a
smaller net force by the dimensionless multiplicative factor     1  /   (  1 +
I  m  r  2        )    {\displaystyle 1/\left(1+{\tfrac {I}{mr^{2}}}\right)}
[1/\left(1+{\tfrac  {I}{mr^{2}}}\right)] where        I  m  r  2
{\displaystyle {\tfrac {I}{mr^{2}}}}  [{\tfrac  {I}{mr^{2}}}] represents the
ratio of the aforesaid virtual mass to the object actual mass and it is equal
to       (     r  gyr.   r    )   2     {\displaystyle \left({\tfrac {r_{\text
{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^{2}}  [\left({\tfrac  {r_{{\text{gyr.}}}}{r}}\right)^{2}]
where      r  gyr.     {\displaystyle r_{\text{gyr.}}}  [r_{{\text{gyr.}}}] is
the radius_of_gyration corresponding to the object rotational inertia in pure
rotation (not the rotational inertia in pure rolling). The square power is due
to the fact that the rotational inertia of a point mass varies proportionally
to the square of its distance to the axis.

Four objects in pure rolling racing down a plane with no air drag. From back to
front: spherical shell (red), solid sphere (orange), cylindrical ring (green)
and solid cylinder (blue). The time to reach the finishing line is entirely a
function of the object mass distribution, slope and gravitational acceleration.
See details, animated_GIF_version.
In the specific case of an object rolling in an inclined_plane which
experiences only static friction, normal force and its own weight, (air_drag is
absent) the acceleration in the direction of rolling down the slope is:
         a =    g sin &#x2061;  ( &#x03B8; )    1 +   (     r  gyr.   r    )
      2        {\displaystyle a={\frac {g\sin \left(\theta \right)}{1+\left(
      {\tfrac {r_{\text{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^{2}}}}  [a={\frac  {g\sin \left
      (\theta \right)}{1+\left({\tfrac  {r_{{\text{gyr.}}}}{r}}\right)^{2}}}]
Derivation
Assuming that the object is placed so as to roll downward in the direction of
the inclined plane (and not partially sideways), the weight can be decomposed
in a component in the direction of rolling and a component perpendicular to the
inclined plane. Only the first force component makes the object roll, the
second is balanced by the contact force, but it does not forms an
actionâreaction pair with it (just as an object in rest on a table).
Therefore, for this analysis, only the first component is considered, thus:
          F  external   = g m sin &#x2061;  ( &#x03B8; )    {\displaystyle F_
      {\text{external}}=gm\sin \left(\theta \right)}  [F_{{\text
      {external}}}=gm\sin \left(\theta \right)]
             a    =    F  net   m         =    (    F  external    1 +   (    r
      gyr.   r   )   2      )  m         =    (    g m sin &#x2061;  ( &#x03B8;
      )    1 +   (    r  gyr.   r   )   2      )  m         =    g m sin
      &#x2061;  ( &#x03B8; )    m  (  1 +   (    r  gyr.   r   )   2    )
      =    g sin &#x2061;  ( &#x03B8; )    1 +   (    r  gyr.   r   )   2
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a&={\frac {F_{\text{net}}}{m}}\\&={\frac

      {\frac {r_{\text{gyr.}}}{r}}\right)^{2}\right)}}\\&={\frac {g\sin \left

      {aligned}}}  [{\begin{aligned}a&={\frac  {F_{{\text{net}}}}{m}}\\&={\frac

      \left(\theta \right)}{1+\left({\frac  {r_{{\text{gyr.}}}}{r}}\right)^
      {2}}}\\\end{aligned}}]
In the last equality the denominator is the same as in the formula for force,
but the factor     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] disappears because its instance
in the force of gravity cancels with its instance due to Newton's third law.
       r  gyr.   r      {\displaystyle {\tfrac {r_{\text{gyr.}}}{r}}}  [{\tfrac
{r_{{\text{gyr.}}}}{r}}] is specific to the object shape and mass distribution,
it does not depends on scale or density. However, it will vary if the object is
made to roll with different radiuses; for instance, it varies between a train
wheel set rolling normally (by its tire), and by its axle. It follows that
given a reference rolling object, another object bigger or with different
density will roll with the same acceleration. This behavior is the same as that
of an object in free fall or an object sliding without friction (instead of
rolling) down an inclined plane.
**** Rolling velocity[edit] ****
*** Rolling velocity (without friction)[edit] ***
Let there be a ball on an inclined plane of angle of inclination of Î¸. Let the
initial velocity be u and final velocity be v. Let the acceleration be a. Then,
         v = u + a t   {\displaystyle v=u+at}  [{\displaystyle v=u+at}]
However, u = 0 and a = g. So,
         v = g t    {\displaystyle v=gt\,}  [{\displaystyle v=gt\,}]
But,     v &#x221D; sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; .   {\displaystyle v\propto \sin

         v = g t sin &#x2061; &#x03B8;    {\displaystyle v=gt\sin \theta \,}  [

*** Rolling velocity (with friction)[edit] ***
Consider a rolling body down an inclined plane and the following-
Mass of body = m, acceleration = a, initial velocity = u, final velocity = v,
time to reach bottom = t, force imparted by body = FR = mg, frictional
force = Ff = ÂµFN cos Î¸, net force = F.
             F    = m a       =    m ( v &#x2212; u )  t         =    m ( v

**** Uphill rolling[edit] ****
*** Without friction[edit] ***
Suppose that a rolling body is moving uphill, i.e., instead of moving down, a
body strikes the base of the inclined plane, naturally, the energy carried by
the body shall make it rise up to a certain height. Consider the height as h.
Let the body have velocity v, accelerating at a and be of mass m. Acceleration
due to gravity is g. The angle of inclination is Î¸.
So, the hypotenuse (see figure) becomes     h cosec &#x2061; &#x03B8;
{\displaystyle h\operatorname {cosec} \theta }  [{\displaystyle h\operatorname
{cosec} \theta }].
Now, to rise up to height h, the body must carry sufficient kinetic energy in
order to work against gravity and work to move uphill. Therefore, we have:
               energy   body      =   work   against gravity   +   work
      moving uphill       &#x21D2;   1 2   m  v  2      = m g h + F h cosec
      &#x2061; &#x03B8;       = m g h + m a h cosec &#x2061; &#x03B8;       = m
      h ( g + a cosec &#x2061; &#x03B8; )     &#x21D2;  v  2      = 2 h ( g + a
      cosec &#x2061; &#x03B8; )       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\text
      {energy}}_{\text{body}}&={\text{work}}_{\text{against gravity}}+{\text
      {work}}_{\text{moving uphill}}\\\Rightarrow {\frac {1}{2}}mv^
      {2}&=mgh+Fh\operatorname {cosec} \theta \\&=mgh+mah\operatorname {cosec}
      \theta \\&=mh(g+a\operatorname {cosec} \theta )\\\Rightarrow v^{2}&=2h
      (g+a\operatorname {cosec} \theta )\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle
      {\begin{aligned}{\text{energy}}_{\text{body}}&={\text{work}}_{\text

      \theta )\\\Rightarrow v^{2}&=2h(g+a\operatorname {cosec} \theta )\end
      {aligned}}}]
*** With friction[edit] ***
Taking into consideration the frictional forces involved, we get:
               energy   body      =   work   against gravity   +   work
      moving uphill   +   work   overcoming friction       &#x21D2;   1 2   m

      &#x2061; &#x03B8;       = m g h + m a h cosec &#x2061; &#x03B8; +
      &#x03BC; m g cos &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) h cosec &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; )
      = m h ( g + a cosec &#x2061; &#x03B8; + g &#x03BC; cot &#x2061; &#x03B8;
      )     &#x21D2;  v  2      = 2 h ( g + a cosec &#x2061; &#x03B8; + g
