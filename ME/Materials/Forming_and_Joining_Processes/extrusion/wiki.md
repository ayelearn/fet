Extrusion is a process used to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional
profile. A material is pushed through a die of the desired cross-section. The
two main advantages of this process over other manufacturing processes are its
ability to create very complex cross-sections, and to work materials that are
brittle, because the material only encounters compressive and shear stresses.
It also forms parts with an excellent surface finish.[1]
Drawing is a similar process, which uses the tensile strength of the material
to pull it through the die. This limits the amount of change which can be
performed in one step, so it is limited to simpler shapes, and multiple stages
are usually needed. Drawing is the main way to produce wire. Metal bars and
tubes are also often drawn.
Extrusion may be continuous (theoretically producing indefinitely long
material) or semi-continuous (producing many pieces). The extrusion process can
be done with the material hot or cold. Commonly extruded materials include
metals, polymers, ceramics, concrete, modelling_clay, and foodstuffs. The
products of extrusion are generally called "extrudates".

the die, then into the cooling tank. This Acu-Power conduit pipe is co-extruded

Also referred to as "hole flanging", hollow cavities within extruded material
cannot be produced using a simple flat extrusion die, because there would be no
way to support the centre barrier of the die. Instead, the die assumes the
shape of a block with depth, beginning first with a shape profile that supports
the center section. The die shape then internally changes along its length into
the final shape, with the suspended center pieces supported from the back of
the die. The material flows around the supports and fuses together to create
the desired closed shape.
The extrusion process in metals may also increase the strength of the material.

In 1797, Joseph_Bramah patented the first extrusion process for making pipe out
of soft metals. It involved preheating the metal and then forcing it through a
die via a hand-driven plunger. In 1820 Thomas Burr implemented that process for
lead pipe, with a hydraulic_press (also invented by Joseph Bramah). At that
time the process was called "squirting". In 1894, Alexander Dick expanded the
extrusion process to copper and brass alloys.[2]
***** Process[edit] *****
Extrusion of a round blank through a die.
The process begins by heating the stock material (for hot or warm extrusion).
It is then loaded into the container in the press. A dummy block is placed
behind it where the ram then presses on the material to push it out of the die.
Afterward the extrusion is stretched in order to straighten it. If better
properties are required then it may be heat_treated or cold_worked.[2]
The extrusion ratio is defined as the starting cross-sectional area divided by
the cross-sectional area of the final extrusion. One of the main advantages of
the extrusion process is that this ratio can be very large while still
producing quality parts.
**** Hot extrusion[edit] ****
Hot extrusion is a hot_working process, which means it is done above the
material's recrystallization temperature to keep the material from work
hardening and to make it easier to push the material through the die. Most hot
extrusions are done on horizontal hydraulic_presses that range from 230 to
11,000 metric tons (250 to 12,130 short tons). Pressures range from 30 to
700 MPa (4,400 to 101,500 psi), therefore lubrication is required, which can be
oil or graphite for lower temperature extrusions, or glass powder for higher
temperature extrusions. The biggest disadvantage of this process is its cost
for machinery and its upkeep.[1]
   Hot extrusion temperature for various
                 metals[1]
Material          Temperature [Â°C (Â°F)]
Magnesium         350â450 (650â850)
Aluminium         350â500 (650â900)
Copper            600â1100 (1200â2000)
Steel             1200â1300 (2200â2400)
Titanium          700â1200 (1300â2100)
Nickel            1000â1200 (1900â2200)
Refractory alloys up to 2000 (4000)
The extrusion process is generally economical when producing between several
kilograms (pounds) and many tons, depending on the material being extruded.
There is a crossover point where roll_forming becomes more economical. For
instance, some steels become more economical to roll if producing more than
20,000 kg (50,000 lb).[2]

      and that the back wall thickness varies.
    * Back side of die. The wall thickness of the extrusion is 3 mm (0.12 in).
**** Cold extrusion[edit] ****
Cold extrusion is done at room temperature or near room temperature. The
advantages of this over hot extrusion are the lack of oxidation, higher
strength due to cold_working, closer tolerances, better surface finish, and
fast extrusion speeds if the material is subject to hot_shortness.[1]
Materials that are commonly cold extruded include: lead, tin, aluminum, copper,
zirconium, titanium, molybdenum, beryllium, vanadium, niobium, and steel.
Examples of products produced by this process are: collapsible tubes, fire
extinguisher cases, shock_absorber cylinders and gear blanks.
**** Warm extrusion[edit] ****
In March 1956, a US Patent was filed for "process for warm extrusion of metal."
Patent US3156043 A outlines that a number of important advantages can be
achieved with warm extrusion of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals and alloys
if a billet to be extruded is changed in its physical properties in response to
physical forces by being heated to a temperature below the critical melting
point.[3] Warm extrusion is done above room temperature, but below the
recrystallization temperature of the material the temperatures ranges from 800
to 1800 Â°F (424 to 975 Â°C). It is usually used to achieve the proper balance
of required forces, ductility and final extrusion properties.[4]
**** Friction extrusion[edit] ****
Main article: Friction_extrusion
Friction extrusion was invented at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented
in 1991. It was originally intended primarily as a method for production of
homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite
materials[5]. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that
the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die.
An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In
practice either the die or the charge may rotate or they may be counter-
rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several
significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of
rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer
of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is
dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial
heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction
extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary
means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the
substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary
motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided
precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge
(friction consolidation) prior to extrusion[6].
**** Microextrusion[edit] ****
Main article: Microextrusion
Microextrusion is a microforming extrusion process performed at the
submillimeter range. Like extrusion, metal is pushed through a die orifice, but
the resulting product's cross section can fit through a 1mm square. Several
microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned
in 1990.[7][8][9] Forward (ram and billet move in the same direction) and
backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were
first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion
methods developing later.[8][10] Regardless of method, one of the greatest
challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture
of the die and ram. "The small size of the die and ram, along with the
stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes."[8]
Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology
review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other
microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including deformation
load_and_defects, forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other
size-related effects on the crystallite (grain) structure and boundaries.[8][9]
**** Extrusion defects[edit] ****
    * Surface cracking occurs when the surface of an extrusion splits
. This is often caused by the extrusion temperature, friction, or speed being
too high. It can also happen at lower temperatures if the extruded product
temporarily sticks to the die.
    * Pipe â A flow pattern that draws the surface oxides and impurities to
      the center of the product. Such a pattern is often caused by high
      friction or cooling of the outer regions of the billet.
    * Internal cracking â When the center of the extrusion develops cracks or
      voids. These cracks are attributed to a state of hydrostatic tensile
      stress at the centerline in the deformation zone in the die. (A similar
      situation to the necked region in a tensile stress specimen)
    * Surface lines â When there are lines visible on the surface of the
      extruded profile. This depends heavily on the quality of the die
      production and how well the die is maintained, as some residues of the
      material extruded can stick to the die surface and produce the embossed
      lines.
***** Equipment[edit] *****

visible in foreground)
There are many different variations of extrusion equipment. They vary by four
major characteristics:[1]
   1. Movement of the extrusion with relation to the ram. If the die is held
      stationary and the ram moves towards it then it is called "direct
      extrusion". If the ram is held stationary and the die moves towards the
      ram it is called "indirect extrusion".
   2. The position of the press, either vertical or horizontal.
   3. The type of drive, either hydraulic or mechanical.
   4. The type of load applied, either conventional (variable) or hydrostatic.
A single or twin screw auger, powered by an electric motor, or a ram, driven by
hydraulic pressure (often used for steel and titanium alloys), oil pressure
(for aluminium), or in other specialized processes such as rollers inside a
perforated drum for the production of many simultaneous streams of material.
Typical extrusion presses cost more than $100,000, whereas dies can cost up to
$2000.
**** Forming internal cavities[edit] ****
Two-piece aluminum extrusion die set (parts shown separated.) The male part (at
right) is for forming the internal cavity in the resulting round tube
extrusion.
There are several methods for forming internal cavities in extrusions. One way
is to use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating mandrel. A fixed
mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy
block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in
slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a
solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the
mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to
control the mandrel independently from the ram.[1] The solid billet could also
be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of
dies incorporate the mandrel in the die and have "legs" that hold the mandrel
in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then
merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.[11]
**** Direct extrusion[edit] ****
Plot of forces required by various extrusion processes.
Direct extrusion, also known as forward extrusion, is the most common extrusion
process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet
is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block
between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage
of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater
than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional
forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel the entire length of the
container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of
process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet
the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must
flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is
not used for this reason.[12]
**** Indirect extrusion[edit] ****
In indirect extrusion, also known as backwards extrusion, the billet and
container move together while the die is stationary. The die is held in place
by a "stem" which has to be longer than the container length. The maximum
length of the extrusion is ultimately dictated by the column strength of the
stem. Because the billet moves with the container the frictional forces are
eliminated. This leads to the following advantages:[13]
    * A 25 to 30% reduction of friction, which allows for extruding larger
      billets, increasing speed, and an increased ability to extrude smaller
      cross-sections
    * There is less of a tendency for extrusions to crack because there is no
      heat formed from friction
    * The container liner will last longer due to less wear
    * The billet is used more uniformly so extrusion defects and coarse grained
      peripherals zones are less likely.
The disadvantages are:[13]
    * Impurities and defects on the surface of the billet affect the surface of
      the extrusion. These defects ruin the piece if it needs to be anodized or
      the aesthetics are important. In order to get around this the billets may
      be wire brushed, machined or chemically cleaned before being used.
    * This process isn't as versatile as direct extrusions because the cross-
      sectional area is limited by the maximum size of the stem.
**** Hydrostatic extrusion[edit] ****
In the hydrostatic extrusion process the billet is completely surrounded by a
pressurized liquid, except where the billet contacts the die. This process can
be done hot, warm, or cold, however the temperature is limited by the stability
of the fluid used. The process must be carried out in a sealed cylinder to
contain the hydrostatic medium. The fluid can be pressurized two ways:[13]
   1. Constant-rate extrusion: A ram or plunger is used to pressurize the fluid
      inside the container.
   2. Constant-pressure extrusion: A pump is used, possibly with a pressure
      intensifier, to pressurize the fluid, which is then pumped to the
      container.
The advantages of this process include:[13]
    * No friction between the container and the billet reduces force
      requirements. This ultimately allows for faster speeds, higher reduction
      ratios, and lower billet temperatures.
    * Usually the ductility of the material increases when high pressures are
      applied.
    * An even flow of material.
    * Large billets and large cross-sections can be extruded.
    * No billet residue is left on the container walls.
The disadvantages are:[13]
    * The billets must be prepared by tapering one end to match the die entry
      angle. This is needed to form a seal at the beginning of the cycle.
      Usually the entire billet needs to be machined to remove any surface
      defects.
    * Containing the fluid under high pressures can be difficult.
    * A billet remnant or a plug of a tougher material must be left at the end
      of the extrusion to prevent a sudden release of the extrusion fluid.
**** Drives[edit] ****
Most modern direct or indirect extrusion presses are hydraulically driven, but
there are some small mechanical presses still used. Of the hydraulic presses
there are two types: direct-drive oil presses and accumulator water drives.
Direct-drive oil presses are the most common because they are reliable and
robust. They can deliver over 35 MPa (5000 psi). They supply a constant
pressure throughout the whole billet. The disadvantage is that they are slow,
between 50 and 200 mm/s (2â8 ips).[14]
Accumulator water drives are more expensive and larger than direct-drive oil
presses, and they lose about 10% of their pressure over the stroke, but they
are much faster, up to 380 mm/s (15 ips). Because of this they are used when
extruding steel. They are also used on materials that must be heated to very
hot temperatures for safety reasons.[14]
Hydrostatic extrusion presses usually use castor_oil at pressure up to 1400 MPa
(200 ksi). Castor oil is used because it has good lubricity and high pressure
properties.[15]
***** Die design[edit] *****
The design of an extrusion profile has a large impact on how readily it can be
extruded. The maximum size for an extrusion is determined by finding the
smallest circle that will fit around the cross-section, this is called the
circumscribing circle. This diameter, in turn, controls the size of the die
required, which ultimately determines if the part will fit in a given press.
For example, a larger press can handle 60 cm (24 in) diameter circumscribing
circles for aluminium and 55 cm (22 in) diameter circles for steel and
titanium.[1]
The complexity of an extruded profile can be roughly quantified by calculating
the shape factor, which is the amount of surface area generated per unit mass
of extrusion. This affects the cost of tooling as well as the rate of
production.[16]
Thicker sections generally need an increased section size. In order for the
material to flow properly legs should not be more than ten times longer than
their thickness. If the cross-section is asymmetrical, adjacent sections should
be as close to the same size as possible. Sharp corners should be avoided; for
aluminium and magnesium the minimum radius should be 0.4 mm (1/64 in) and for
steel corners should be 0.75 mm (0.030 in) and fillets should be 3 mm
(0.12 in). The following table lists the minimum cross-section and thickness
for various materials.[1]
Material        Minimum cross-section [cmÂ² (sq. Minimum thickness [mm (in.)]
                in.)]
Carbon steels   2.5 (0.40)                         3.00 (0.120)
Stainless steel 3.0â4.5 (0.45â0.70)      3.00â4.75 (0.120â0.187)
Titanium        3.0 (0.50)                         3.80 (0.150)
Aluminium       < 2.5 (0.40)                      0.70 (0.028)
Magnesium       < 2.5 (0.40)                      1.00 (0.040)
***** Materials[edit] *****
**** Metal[edit] ****
Metals that are commonly extruded include:[17]
    * Aluminium is the most commonly extruded material. Aluminium can be hot or
      cold extruded. If it is hot extruded it is heated to 575 to 1100 Â°F (300
      to 600 Â°C). Examples of products include profiles for tracks, frames,
      rails, mullions, and heat_sinks.
    * Brass is used to extrude corrosion free rods, automobile parts, pipe
      fittings, engineering parts.
    * Copper (1100 to 1825 Â°F (600 to 1000 Â°C)) pipe, wire, rods, bars,
      tubes, and welding electrodes. Often more than 100 ksi (690 MPa) is
      required to extrude copper.
    * Lead and tin (maximum 575 Â°F (300 Â°C)) pipes, wire, tubes, and cable
      sheathing. Molten lead may also be used in place of billets on vertical
      extrusion presses.
    * Magnesium (575 to 1100 Â°F (300 to 600 Â°C)) aircraft parts and nuclear
      industry parts. Magnesium is about as extrudable as aluminum.
    * Zinc (400 to 650 Â°F (200 to 350 Â°C)) rods, bar, tubes, hardware
      components, fitting, and handrails.
    * Steel (1825 to 2375 Â°F (1000 to 1300 Â°C)) rods and tracks. Usually
      plain_carbon_steel is extruded, but alloy steel and stainless_steel can
      also be extruded.
    * Titanium (1100 to 1825 Â°F (600 to 1000 Â°C)) aircraft components
      including seat tracks, engine rings, and other structural parts.
Magnesium and aluminium alloys usually have a 0.75 Î¼m (30 Î¼in) RMS or better
surface finish. Titanium and steel can achieve a 3 micrometres (120 Î¼in) RMS.
[1]
In 1950, Ugine SÃ©journet, of France, invented a process which uses glass as a
lubricant for extruding steel.[18] The Ugine-Sejournet, or Sejournet, process
is now used for other materials that have melting temperatures higher than
steel or that require a narrow range of temperatures to extrude, such as the
platinum-iridium_alloy used to make kilogram mass standards.[19] The process
starts by heating the materials to the extruding temperature and then rolling
it in glass powder. The glass melts and forms a thin film, 20 to 30 mils (0.5
to 0.75 mm), in order to separate it from chamber walls and allow it to act as
a lubricant. A thick solid glass ring that is 0.25 to 0.75 in (6 to 18 mm)
thick is placed in the chamber on the die to lubricate the extrusion as it is
forced through the die. A second advantage of this glass ring is its ability to
insulate the heat of the billet from the die. The extrusion will have a 1 mil
thick layer of glass, which can be easily removed once it cools.[4]
Another breakthrough in lubrication is the use of phosphate coatings. With this
process, in conjunction with glass lubrication, steel can be cold extruded. The
phosphate coat absorbs the liquid glass to offer even better lubricating
properties.[4]
**** Plastic[edit] ****

Sectional view of how a caterpillar haul-off provides line tension
Main article: Plastics_extrusion
Plastics_extrusion commonly uses plastic chips or pellets, which are usually
dried, to drive out moisture, in a hopper before going to the feed screw. The
polymer resin is heated to molten state by a combination of heating elements
and shear heating from the extrusion screw. The screw, or screws as the case
with twin screw extrusion, forces the resin through a die, forming the resin
into the desired shape. The extrudate is cooled and solidified as it is pulled
through the die or water tank. A "caterpillar haul-off" (called a "puller" in
the US) is used to provide tension on the extrusion line which is essential for
overall quality of the extrudate. Pelletizers can also create this tension
while pulling extruded strands in to be cut. The caterpillar haul-off must
provide a consistent pull; otherwise, variation in cut lengths or distorted
product will result. In some cases (such as fibre-reinforced tubes) the
extrudate is pulled through a very long die, in a process called "pultrusion".
The configuration of the interior screws are a driving force dependent on the
application. Mixing elements or convey elements are used in various formations.
Extrusion is common in the application of adding colorant to molten plastic
thus creating specific custom color.
A multitude of polymers are used in the production of plastic tubing, pipes,
rods, rails, seals, and sheets or films.
**** Ceramic[edit] ****
Ceramic can also be formed into shapes via extrusion. Terracotta extrusion is
used to produce pipes. Many modern bricks are also manufactured using a brick
extrusion process.[20] {403 forbidden link 12Jul15}

Main article: Food_extrusion
Elbow macaroni is an extruded hollow pasta.
With the advent of industrial manufacturing, extrusion found application in
food_processing of instant foods and snacks, along with its already known uses
in plastics and metal fabrication. The main role of extrusion was originally
developed for conveying and shaping fluid forms of processed raw materials.
Present day, extrusion cooking technologies and capabilities have developed
into sophisticated processing functions including: mixing, conveying, shearing,
separation, heating, cooling, shaping, co-extrusion, venting volatiles and
moisture, encapsulation, flavor generation and sterilization.[21] Products such
as certain pastas, many breakfast_cereals, premade cookie_dough, some french
fries, certain baby_foods, dry or semi-moist pet_food and ready-to-eat snacks
are mostly manufactured by extrusion. It is also used to produce modified
starch, and to pelletize animal_feed.
Generally, high-temperature extrusion is used for the manufacture of ready-to-
eat snacks, while cold extrusion is used for the manufacture of pasta and
related products intended for later cooking and consumption. The processed
products have low moisture and hence considerably higher shelf life, and
provide variety and convenience to consumers.
In the extrusion process, raw materials are first ground to the correct
particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other
ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process.
The preconditioned mix is then passed through an extruder, where it is forced
through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place
within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to
the pressure generated (10â20 bar). The main independent parameters during
extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel
temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce
both protein_denaturation and starch_gelatinization, depending on inputs and
parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing
texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).
**** Drug carriers[edit] ****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (August
         2008)
For use in pharmaceutical products, extrusion through nano-porous, polymeric
filters is being used to produce suspensions of lipid vesicles liposomes or
transfersomes with a particular size of a narrow size_distribution. The anti-
cancer drug Doxorubicin in liposome delivery system is formulated by extrusion,
for example. Hot melt extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral
dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and
bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse
poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and
bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and
agitation to mix materials together and âextrudeâ them through a die. Twin-
screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up
particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and
compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.[22]
**** Biomass briquettes[edit] ****
Main article: Biomass_briquettes
The extrusion production technology of fuel briquettes is the process of
extrusion screw wastes (straw, sunflower husks, buckwheat, etc.) or finely
shredded wood waste (sawdust) under high pressure when heated from 160 to
350Â°C. The resulting fuel briquettes do not include any of the binders, but
one natural â the lignin contained in the cells of plant wastes. The
temperature during compression causes melting of the surface of bricks, making
it more solid, which is important for the transportation of briquettes.
