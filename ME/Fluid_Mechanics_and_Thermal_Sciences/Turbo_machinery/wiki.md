Mounting of a steam_turbine produced by Siemens, Germany
Turbomachinery, in mechanical_engineering, describes machines that transfer
energy between a rotor and a fluid, including both turbines and compressors.
While a turbine transfers energy from a fluid to a rotor, a compressor
transfers energy from a rotor to a fluid.[1][2]
These two types of machines are governed by the same basic relationships
including Newton's_second_Law_of_Motion and Euler's_pump_and_turbine_equation
for compressible_fluids. Centrifugal_pumps are also turbomachines that transfer
energy from a rotor to a fluid, usually a liquid, while turbines and
compressors usually work with a gas.[1]

***** History[edit] *****
The first turbomachines could be identified as water_wheels, which appeared
between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE in the Mediterranean region. These were
used throughout the medieval period and began the first Industrial_Revolution.
When steam_power started to be used, as the first power source driven by the
combustion of a fuel rather than renewable natural power sources, this was as
reciprocating_engines. Primitive turbines and conceptual designs for them, such
as the smoke_jack, appeared intermittently but the temperatures and pressures
required for a practically efficient turbine exceeded the manufacturing
technology of the time. The first patent for gas turbines were filed in 1791 by
John_Barber. Practical hydroelectric water turbines and steam turbines did not
appear until the 1880s. Gas turbines appeared in the 1930s.
The first impulse type turbine was created by Carl Gustaf de Laval in 1883.
This was closely followed by the first practical reaction type turbine in 1884,
built by Charles_Parsons. Parsonsâ first design was a multi-stage axial-flow
unit, which George_Westinghouse acquired and began manufacturing in 1895, while
General_Electric acquired de Lavalâs designs in 1897. Since then, development
has skyrocketed from Parsonsâ early design, producing 0.746 kW, to modern
nuclear steam turbines producing upwards of 1500 MW. Today, steam turbines
account for roughly 90% of electrical power generated in the United States.
[citation_needed] Then the first functioning industrial gas turbines were used
in the late 1890s to power street lights (Meher-Homji, 2000).
***** Classification[edit] *****
A steam turbine from MAN_SE subdidiary MAN Turbo
In general, the two kinds of turbomachines encountered in practice are open and
closed turbomachines. Open machines such as propellers, windmills, and
unshrouded fans act on an infinite extent of fluid, whereas closed machines
operate on a finite quantity of fluid as it passes through a housing or casing.
[2]
Turbomachines are also categorized according to the type of flow. When the flow
is parallel to the axis_of_rotation, they are called axial flow machines, and
when flow is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, they are referred to as
radial (or centrifugal) flow machines. There is also a third category, called
mixed flow machines, where both radial and axial flow velocity components are
present.[2]
Turbomachines may be further classified into two additional categories: those
that absorb energy to increase the fluid_pressure, i.e. pumps, fans, and
compressors, and those that produce energy such as turbines by expanding flow
to lower pressures. Of particular interest are applications which contain
pumps, fans, compressors and turbines. These components are essential in almost
all mechanical equipment systems, such as power and refrigeration_cycles.[2][3]

***** Turbomachines[edit] *****
**** Definition[edit] ****
Any device that extracts energy from or imparts energy to a continuously moving
stream of fluid can be called a turbomachine. Elaborating, a turbomachine is a
power or head generating machine which employs the dynamic action of a rotating
element, the rotor; the action of the rotor changes the energy level of the
continuously flowing fluid through the machine. Turbines, compressors and fans
are all members of this family of machines.[4]
In contrast to positive displacement machines (particularly of the
reciprocating type which are low speed machines based on the mechanical and
volumetric efficiency considerations), the majority of turbomachines run at
comparatively higher speeds without any mechanical problems and volumetric
efficiency close to one hundred percent.[5]
**** Categorization[edit] ****
*** Energy conversion[edit] ***
Turbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the direction of energy
conversion:[1][2]
    * Absorb power to increase the fluid pressure or head (ducted Fans,
      compressors and pumps).
    * Produce power by expanding fluid to a lower pressure or head (hydraulic,
      steam and gas turbines).
*** Fluid flow[edit] ***
Turbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the nature of flow path
through the passage of the rotor:[6]
Axial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram[1]
Axial_flow_turbomachines - When the path of the through-flow is wholly or
mainly parallel to the axis of rotation, the device is termed an axial flow
turbomachine.[7] The radial component of the fluid velocity is negligible.
Since there is no change in the direction of the fluid, several axial stages
can be used to increase power output.
A Kaplan_turbine is an example of an axial flow turbine.
In the figure:
    * U = Blade velocity,
    * Vf = Flow velocity,
    * V = Absolute velocity,
    * Vr = Relative velocity,
    * Vw = Tangential or Whirl component of velocity.
Radial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram[1]
Radial_flow_turbomachines - When the path of the throughflow is wholly or
mainly in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the device is termed a
radial flow turbomachine.[7] Therefore, the change of radius between the entry
and the exit is finite. A Radial turbomachine can be inward or outward flow
type depending on the purpose that needs to be served. Outward flow type
increases the energy level of the fluid and vice versa. Due to continuous
change in direction, several radial stages are generally not used.
A centrifugal_pump is an example of a radial flow turbomachine.
Mixed_flow_turbomachines â When axial and radial flow are both present and
neither is negligible, the device is termed a mixed flow turbomachine.[7] It
combines flow and force components of both radial and axial types.
A Francis_turbine is an example of a mixed-flow turbine.
*** Physical action[edit] ***
Turbomachines can finally be classified on the relative magnitude of the
pressure changes that take place across a stage:[2][3]
An Impulse Turbomachine Stage[1]
Impulse Turbomachines operate by accelerating and changing the flow direction
of fluid through a stationary nozzle (the stator blade) onto the rotor blade.
The nozzle serves to change the incoming pressure into velocity, the enthalpy
of the fluid decreases as the velocity increases. Pressure and enthalpy drop
over the rotor blades is minimal. Velocity will decrease over the rotor.[1][7]
Newton's_second_law describes the transfer of energy. Impulse turbomachines do
not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created
by the nozzle prior to reaching the blading on the rotor.
A Pelton_wheel is an impulse design.
A Reaction Turbomachine Stage[1]
Reaction Turbomachines operate by reacting to the flow of fluid through
aerofoil shaped rotor and stator blades. The velocity of the fluid through the
sets of blades increases slightly (as with a nozzle) as it passes from rotor to
stator and vice versa. The velocity of the fluid then decreases again once it
has passed between the gap. Pressure and enthalpy consistently decrease through
the sets of blades.[1]
Newton's_third_law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. A
pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid. For compressible
working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the
expanding gas efficiently.
Most turbomachines use a combination of impulse and reaction in their design,
often with impulse and reaction parts on the same blade.

***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Power Generation[edit] ****
Hydro_electric- Hydro-electric turbomachinery uses potential energy stored in
water to flow over an open impeller to turn a generator which creates
electricity
Steam_turbines- Steam turbines used in power generation come in many different
variations. The overall principle is high pressure steam is forced over blades
attached to a shaft, which turns a generator. As the steam travels through the
turbine, it passes through smaller blades causing the shaft to spin faster,
creating more electricity.
Gas_turbines- Gas turbines work much like steam turbines. Air is forced in
through a series of blades that turn a shaft. Then fuel is mixed with the air
and causes a combustion reaction, increasing the power. This then causes the
shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.
Windmills- Also known as a wind turbine, windmills are increasing in popularity
for their ability to efficiently use the wind to generate electricity. Although
they come in many shapes and sizes, the most common one is the large three-
blade. The blades work on the same principle as an airplane wing. As wind
passes over the blades, it creates an area of low and high pressure, causing
the blade to move, spinning a shaft and creating electricity. It is most like a
steam turbine, but work with an infinite supply of wind.
**** Marine[edit] ****
Steam turbine- Steam turbines in marine applications are very similar to those
in power generation. The few differences between them are size and power
output. Steam turbines on ships are much smaller because they donât need to
power a whole town. They arenât very common because of their high initial
cost, high specific fuel consumption, and expensive machinery that goes with
it.
Gas turbines- Gas turbines in marine applications are becoming more popular due
to their smaller size, increased efficiency, and ability to burn cleaner fuels.
They run just like gas turbines for power generation, but are also much smaller
and do require more machinery for propulsion. They are most popular in naval
ships as they can be at a dead stop to full power in minutes (Kayadelen, 2013),
and are much smaller for a given amount of power. Flow of air through a
turbocharger and engine
Water_jet- Essentially a waterjet drive is like an aircraft turbojet with the
difference that the operating fluid is water instead of air.[8] Water jets are
best suited to fast vessels and are thus used often by the military. Water jet
propulsion has many advantages over other forms of marine propulsion, such as
stern drives, outboard motors, shafted propellers and surface drives.[9]
**** Auto[edit] ****
Air and exhaust flow through engine and turbocharger
Turbochargers- Turbochargers are one of the most popular turbomachines. They
are used mainly for adding power to engines by adding more air. It combines
both forms of turbomachines. Exhaust gases from the engine spin a bladed wheel,
much like a turbine. That wheel then spins another bladed wheel, sucking and
compressing outside air into the engine.
Superchargers- Superchargers are used for engine-power enhancement as well, but
only work off the principle of compression. They use the mechanical power from
the engine to spin a screw or vane, some way to suck in and compress the air
into the engine.
**** General[edit] ****
Pumps- Pumps are another very popular turbomachine. Although there are very
many different types of pumps, they all do the same thing. Pumps are used to
move fluids around using some sort of mechanical power, from electric motors to
full size diesel engines. Pumps have thousands of uses, and are the true basis
to turbomachinery (Å korpÃ­k, 2017).
Air_compressors- Air compressors are another very popular turbomachine. They
work on the principle of compression by sucking in and compressing air into a
holding tank. Air compressors are one of the most basic turbomachines.
Fans- Fans are the most general type of turbomachines. They work opposite of
wind turbines. Mechanical power spins the blades, forcing air through them and
forcing out. Basic desk-top fans to large turbofan airplane engines work this
way.
**** Aerospace[edit] ****
Gas turbines- Aerospace gas turbines, more commonly known as jet engines, are
the most common gas turbines. They are the most like power generation turbines
because the electricity used on the airplane is from the turbines, while also
providing the propulsion. These turbines are the smallest out of the industrial
turbines, and are most often the most advanced.
Turbopumps- Rocket engines require very high propellant pressures and mass flow
rates, meaning their pumps require a lot of power. One of the most common
solutions to this issue is to use a turbopump that extracts energy from an
energetic fluid flow. The source of this energetic fluid flow could be one or a
combination of many things, including the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide,
the combustion of a portion of the propellants, or even the heating of
cryogenic propellants run through coolant jackets in the combustion chamber's
walls.
***** Partial list of turbomachine topics[edit] *****
Many types of dynamic continuous flow turbomachinery exist. Below is a partial
list of these types. What is notable about these turbomachines is that the same
fundamentals apply to all. Certainly there are significant differences between
these machines and between the types of analysis that are typically applied to
specific cases. This does not negate the fact that they are unified by the same
underlying physics of fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, aerodynamics,
hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics.
