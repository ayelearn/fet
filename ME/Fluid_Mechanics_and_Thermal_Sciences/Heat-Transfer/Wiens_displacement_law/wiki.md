****** Wien's displacement law ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
      Not to be confused with Wien_distribution_law.
Black-body_radiation as a function of wavelength for various temperatures. Each
temperature curve peaks at a different wavelength and Wien's law describes the
shift of that peak.
Wien's displacement law states that the black-body_radiation curve for
different temperatures will peak at different wavelengths that are inversely
proportional to the temperature. The shift of that peak is a direct consequence
of the Planck_radiation_law, which describes the spectral brightness of black-
body radiation as a function of wavelength at any given temperature. However,
it had been discovered by Wilhelm_Wien several years before Max_Planck
developed that more general equation, and describes the entire shift of the
spectrum of black-body radiation toward shorter wavelengths as temperature
increases.
Formally, Wien's displacement law states that the spectral_radiance of black-
body radiation per unit wavelength, peaks at the wavelength Î»max given by:
          &#x03BB;  max   =   b T     {\displaystyle \lambda _{\text{max}}=
      {\frac {b}{T}}}  [{\displaystyle \lambda _{\text{max}}={\frac {b}{T}}}]
where T is the absolute temperature in kelvins. b is a constant_of
proportionality called Wien's displacement constant, equal to
2.897771955...Ã10â3 mâK,[1] or to obtain wavelength in micrometers, b â
2898 Î¼mâK. If one is considering the peak of black body emission per unit
frequency or per proportional bandwidth, one must use a different
proportionality constant. However, the form of the law remains the same: the
peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature, and the peak
frequency is directly proportional to temperature.
Wien's displacement law may be referred to as "Wien's law", a term which is
also used for the Wien_approximation.

***** Examples[edit] *****
Wien's displacement law is relevant to some everyday experiences:
    * A piece of metal heated by a blow_torch first becomes "red hot" as the
      very longest visible_wavelengths appear red, then becomes more orange-red
      as the temperature is increased, and at very high temperatures would be
      described as "white hot" as shorter and shorter wavelengths come to
      predominate the black body emission spectrum. Before it had even reached
      the red hot temperature, the thermal emission was mainly at longer
      infrared wavelengths, which are not visible; nevertheless, that radiation
      could be felt as it warms one's nearby skin.
    * One easily observes changes in the color of an incandescent_light_bulb
      (which produces light through thermal radiation) as the temperature of
      its filament is varied by a light_dimmer. As the light is dimmed and the
      filament temperature decreases, the distribution of color shifts toward
      longer wavelengths and the light appears redder, as well as dimmer.
    * A wood fire at 1500 K puts out peak radiation at about 2000 nm. 98% of
      its radiation is at wavelengths longer than 1000 nm, and only a tiny
      proportion at visible_wavelengths (390â700 nm). Consequently, a
      campfire can keep one warm but is a poor source of visible light.
    * The effective temperature of the Sun is 5778 K. Using Wien's law, one
      finds a peak emission per nanometer (of wavelength) at a wavelength of
      about 500 nm, in the green portion of the spectrum near the peak
      sensitivity of the human eye.[2][3] On the other hand, in terms of power
      per unit optical frequency, the Sun's peak emission is at 343 THz or a
      wavelength of 883 nm in the near infrared. In terms of power per
      percentage bandwidth, the peak is at about 635 nm, a red wavelength.
      Regardless of how one wants to plot the spectrum, about half of the sun's
      radiation is at wavelengths shorter than 710 nm, about the limit of the
      human vision. Of that, about 12% is at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm,
      ultraviolet wavelengths, which is invisible to an unaided human eye. It
      can be appreciated that a rather large amount of the Sun's radiation
      falls in the fairly small visible_spectrum.
The color of a star is determined by its temperature, according to Wien's law.
In the constellation of Orion, one can compare Betelgeuse (T â 3300 K, upper
left), Rigel (T = 12100 K, bottom right), Bellatrix (T = 22000 K, upper right),
and Mintaka (T = 31800 K, rightmost of the 3 "belt stars" in the middle).
    * The preponderance of emission in the visible range, however, is not the
      case in most stars. The hot supergiant Rigel emits 60% of its light in
      the ultraviolet, while the cool supergiant Betelgeuse emits 85% of its
      light at infrared wavelengths. With both stars prominent in the
      constellation of Orion, one can easily appreciate the color difference
      between the blue-white Rigel (T = 12100 K) and the red Betelgeuse
      (T â 3300 K). While few stars are as hot as Rigel, stars cooler than
      the sun or even as cool as Betelgeuse are very commonplace.
    * Mammals with a skin temperature of about 300 K emit peak radiation at
      around 10 Î¼m in the far infrared. This is therefore the range of
      infrared wavelengths that pit_viper snakes and passive_IR_cameras must
      sense.
    * When comparing the apparent color of lighting sources (including
      fluorescent_lights, LED_lighting, computer_monitors, and photoflash), it
      is customary to cite the color_temperature. Although the spectra of such
      lights are not accurately described by the black-body radiation curve, a
      color temperature is quoted for which black-body radiation would most
      closely match the subjective color of that source. For instance, the
      blue-white fluorescent light sometimes used in an office may have a color
      temperature of 6500 K, whereas the reddish tint of a dimmed incandescent
      light may have a color temperature (and an actual filament temperature)
      of 2000 K. Note that the informal description of the former (bluish)
      color as "cool" and the latter (reddish) as "warm" is exactly opposite
      the actual temperature change involved in black-body radiation.
***** Discovery[edit] *****
The law is named for Wilhelm_Wien, who derived it in 1893 based on a
thermodynamic argument.[4] Wien considered adiabatic expansion of a cavity
containing waves of light in thermal equilibrium. He showed that, under slow
expansion or contraction, the energy of light reflecting off the walls changes
in exactly the same way as the frequency. A general principle of thermodynamics
is that a thermal equilibrium state, when expanded very slowly, stays in
thermal equilibrium. The adiabatic principle allowed Wien to conclude that for
each mode, the adiabatic invariant energy/frequency is only a function of the
other adiabatic invariant, the frequency/temperature. A modern variant of
Wien's derivation can be found in the textbook by Wannier.[5]
The consequence is that the shape of the black-body radiation function (which
was not yet understood) would shift proportionally in frequency (or inversely
proportionally in wavelength) with temperature. When Max_Planck later
formulated the correct black-body_radiation_function it did not explicitly
include Wien's constant b. Rather, Planck's_constant h was created and
introduced into his new formula. From Planck's constant h and the Boltzmann
constant k, Wien's constant b can be obtained.
***** Frequency-dependent formulation[edit] *****
For spectral flux considered per unit frequency     d &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle
d\nu }  [d\nu ] (in hertz), Wien's displacement law describes a peak emission
at the optical frequency      &#x03BD;  max     {\displaystyle \nu _{\max }}
[\nu _{\max }] given by:
          &#x03BD;  max   =   &#x03B1; h   k T &#x2248; ( 5.879 &#x00D7;  10
      10   &#xA0;  H z  /  K  ) &#x22C5; T   {\displaystyle \nu _{\max }=
      {\alpha \over h}kT\approx (5.879\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm {Hz/K} )\cdot T}
      [\nu _{\max }={\alpha  \over h}kT\approx (5.879\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm
      {Hz/K} )\cdot T]
where Î± â 2.8214391... is a constant resulting from the numerical solution
of the maximization equation, k is the Boltzmann_constant, h is the Planck
constant, and T is the temperature (in kelvins). With the emission now
considered per unit frequency, this peak now corresponds to a wavelength 70%
longer than the peak considered per unit wavelength. The relevant math is
detailed in the next section.
***** Derivation from Planck's law[edit] *****
Planck's_law for the spectrum of black-body radiation predicts the Wien
displacement law and may be used to numerically evaluate the constant relating
temperature and peak wavelength (or frequency). According to one form of that
law, the black body spectral radiance (power per emitting area per solid angle)
          u  &#x03BB;   ( &#x03BB; , T ) =    2 h  c  2     &#x03BB;  5       1
      e  h c  /  &#x03BB; k T   &#x2212; 1    .   {\displaystyle u_{\lambda }
      (\lambda ,T)={2hc^{2} \over \lambda ^{5}}{1 \over e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1}.}
      [u_{\lambda }(\lambda ,T)={2hc^{2} \over \lambda ^{5}}{1 \over e^{hc/
      \lambda kT}-1}.]
Differentiating u(Î»,T) with respect to Î» and setting the derivative equal to
zero gives
            &#x2202; u   &#x2202; &#x03BB;    = 2 h  c  2    (     h c   k T
      &#x03BB;  7         e  h c  /  &#x03BB; k T     (   e  h c  /  &#x03BB; k
      T   &#x2212; 1  )   2     &#x2212;   1  &#x03BB;  6       5   e  h c  /
      &#x03BB; k T   &#x2212; 1     )  = 0 ,   {\displaystyle {\partial u \over
      \partial \lambda }=2hc^{2}\left({hc \over kT\lambda ^{7}}{e^{hc/\lambda
      kT} \over \left(e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1\right)^{2}}-{1 \over \lambda ^{6}}{5
      \over e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1}\right)=0,}  [{\displaystyle {\partial u \over
      \partial \lambda }=2hc^{2}\left({hc \over kT\lambda ^{7}}{e^{hc/\lambda
      kT} \over \left(e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1\right)^{2}}-{1 \over \lambda ^{6}}{5
      \over e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1}\right)=0,}]
which can be simplified to give
            h c   &#x03BB; k T       e  h c  /  &#x03BB; k T     e  h c  /
      &#x03BB; k T   &#x2212; 1    &#x2212; 5 = 0.   {\displaystyle {hc \over
      \lambda kT}{e^{hc/\lambda kT} \over e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1}-5=0.}  [{hc
      \over \lambda kT}{e^{hc/\lambda kT} \over e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1}-5=0.]
By defining:
         x &#x2261;    h c   &#x03BB; k T    ,   {\displaystyle x\equiv {hc
      \over \lambda kT},}  [x\equiv {hc \over \lambda kT},]
the equation becomes one in the single variable x:
            x  e  x      e  x   &#x2212; 1    &#x2212; 5 = 0.   {\displaystyle
      {xe^{x} \over e^{x}-1}-5=0.}  [{xe^{x} \over e^{x}-1}-5=0.]
which is equivalent to:
         ( x &#x2212; 5 )  e  x   + 5 = 0.   {\displaystyle (x-5)e^{x}+5=0.}  [
      {\displaystyle (x-5)e^{x}+5=0.}]
This equation is easily numerically solved using Newton's_method yielding [note
1] x = 4.965114231744276 to double precision floating point accuracy.
Solving for the wavelength Î» in units of nanometers, and using kelvin for the
temperature yields:
                &#x03BB;  max   =    h c  x     1  k T    =
            2.897771955185172 &#x00D7;  10  6   &#xA0;  nm   &#x22C5;   K   T
            .   {\displaystyle \lambda _{\text{max}}={\frac {hc}{x}}{\frac {1}
            {kT}}={\frac {2.897771955185172\times 10^{6}~{\text{nm}}{\cdot }
            {\text{K}}}{T}}.}  [{\displaystyle \lambda _{\text{max}}={\frac
            {hc}{x}}{\frac {1}{kT}}={\frac {2.897771955185172\times 10^{6}~
            {\text{nm}}{\cdot }{\text{K}}}{T}}.}]
**** Alternate maxima[edit] ****
The form of Wien's displacement law in terms of maximum radiance per unit
frequency is derived using similar methods, but starting with the form of
Planck's_law as a function of frequency Î½:
          u  &#x03BD;   ( &#x03BD; , T ) =    2 h  &#x03BD;  3     c  2       1
      e  h &#x03BD;  /  k T   &#x2212; 1    .   {\displaystyle u_{\nu }(\nu
      ,T)={2h\nu ^{3} \over c^{2}}{1 \over e^{h\nu /kT}-1}.}  [{\displaystyle
      u_{\nu }(\nu ,T)={2h\nu ^{3} \over c^{2}}{1 \over e^{h\nu /kT}-1}.}]
The preceding process using this equation yields:
         &#x2212;    h &#x03BD;   k T       e  h &#x03BD;  /  k T     e  h
      &#x03BD;  /  k T   &#x2212; 1    + 3 = 0.   {\displaystyle -{h\nu \over
      kT}{e^{h\nu /kT} \over e^{h\nu /kT}-1}+3=0.}  [{\displaystyle -{h\nu
      \over kT}{e^{h\nu /kT} \over e^{h\nu /kT}-1}+3=0.}]
The net result is:
         ( x &#x2212; 3 )  e  x   + 3 = 0.   {\displaystyle (x-3)e^{x}+3=0.}  [
      {\displaystyle (x-3)e^{x}+3=0.}]
This is similarly solved with Newton's_method yielding x = 2.8214393721220787
to double precision floating point accuracy. Solving for Î½ produces:
                &#x03BD;  max   =    x k  h   T = (  0.05878923811360855 &#xA0;
            THz   &#x22C5;    K   &#x2212; 1    ) &#x22C5;  T  .
            {\displaystyle \nu _{\text{max}}={\frac {xk}{h}}T=(
            {0.05878923811360855~{\text{THz}}{\cdot }{\text{K}}^{-1}})\cdot
            {T}.}  [{\displaystyle \nu _{\text{max}}={\frac {xk}{h}}T=(
            {0.05878923811360855~{\text{THz}}{\cdot }{\text{K}}^{-1}})\cdot
            {T}.}]
Notice that for a given temperature this form implies a different maximal
wavelength, for these functions are power density functions, and take different
forms for different parameterizations. Since wavelength and frequency have a
reciprocal relation, they constitute significantly different parameterizations.
For example, using T = 6000 K the wavelength for maximal power density is Î» =
482.962 nm with corresponding frequency Î½ = 620.737 THz. For the same
temperature, the frequency for maximal power density is Î½ = 352.735 THz with
corresponding wavelength Î» = 849.907 nm.
The total radiated power is the integral of the power distribution over all
positive values (for these two cases), and that is invariant for a given
temperature. Additionally, for a given temperature the radiated power
consisting of all photons between two wavelengths must be the same regardless
of which distribution you use; that is to say, integrating the wavelength
distribution from Î»1 to Î»2 will result in the same value as integrating the
frequency distribution between the two frequencies that correspond to Î»1 and
Î»2, namely from c/Î»2 to c/Î»1. However, the distribution shape depends on the
parameterization, and for a different parameterization the distribution will
typically have a different peak power density, as these calculations
demonstrate.
Using the value 4 to solve the implicit equation yields the peak in the
spectral radiance density function expressed in the parameter radiance per
proportional bandwidth. This is perhaps a more intuitive way of presenting
"wavelength of peak emission". That yields x = 3.9206903948728864 to double
precision floating point accuracy.
The important point of Wien's law, however, is that any such wavelength marker,
including the median wavelength (or the wavelength below which a specified
percentage of the emission occurs) is proportional to the reciprocal of
temperature. That is, the shape of the distribution for a given
parameterization, scales with and translates according to temperature, and can
be calculated once for a canonical temperature, then appropriately shifted and
scaled to obtain the distribution for another temperature. This is a
consequence of the strong statement of Wien's law.

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ The equation     x  e  x    /  (  e  x   &#x2212; 1 ) = n
      {\displaystyle xe^{x}/(e^{x}-1)=n}  [xe^{x}/(e^{x}-1)=n] cannot be solved
      in terms of elementary functions. It can be solved in terms of Lambert's
      product_log_function as     x = n + W ( &#x2212; n  e  &#x2212; n   )
      {\displaystyle x=n+W(-ne^{-n})}  [{\displaystyle x=n+W(-ne^{-n})}], but
      the exact solution is not important in this derivation.
