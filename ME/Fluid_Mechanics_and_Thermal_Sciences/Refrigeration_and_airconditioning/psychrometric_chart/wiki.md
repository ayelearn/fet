Psychrometrics, psychrometry, and hygrometry are names for the field of
engineering concerned with the physical and thermodynamic properties of gas-
vapor mixtures. The term comes from the Greek psuchron (ÏÏÏÏÏÎ½) meaning
"cold"[1] and metron (Î¼Î­ÏÏÎ¿Î½) meaning "means of measurement".[2]

***** Common applications[edit] *****
Although the principles of psychrometry apply to any physical system consisting
of gas-vapor mixtures, the most common system of interest is the mixture of
water vapor and air, because of its application in heating,_ventilating,_and
air-conditioning and meteorology. In human terms, our thermal_comfort is in
large part a consequence of not just the temperature of the surrounding air,
but (because we cool ourselves via perspiration) the extent to which that air
is saturated with water vapor.
Many substances are hygroscopic, meaning they attract water, usually in
proportion to the relative humidity or above a critical_relative_humidity. Such
substances include cotton, paper, cellulose, other wood products, sugar,
calcium_oxide (burned lime) and many chemicals and fertilizers. Industries that
use these materials are concerned with relative humidity control in production
and storage of such materials.
In industrial drying applications, such as drying paper, manufacturers usually
try to achieve an optimum between low relative humidity, which increases the
drying rate, and energy usage, which decreases as exhaust relative humidity
increases. In many industrial applications it is important to avoid
condensation that would ruin product or cause corrosion.
Molds and fungi can be controlled by keeping relative humidity low. Wood
destroying fungi generally do not grow at relative humidities below 75%.
***** Psychrometric properties[edit] *****
**** Dry-bulb temperature (DBT)[edit] ****
Main article: Dry-bulb_temperature
The dry-bulb temperature is the temperature indicated by a thermometer exposed
to the air in a place sheltered from direct solar radiation. The term dry-bulb
is customarily added to temperature to distinguish it from wet-bulb and
dewpoint temperature. In meteorology and psychrometrics the word temperature by
itself without a prefix usually means dry-bulb temperature. Technically, the
temperature registered by the dry-bulb thermometer of a psychrometer. The name
implies that the sensing bulb or element is in fact dry. WMO provides a 23-page
chapter on the measurement of temperature.[3]
**** Wet-bulb temperature (WBT)[edit] ****
Main article: Wet-bulb_temperature
The thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is a thermodynamic_property of a mixture
of air and water vapor. The value indicated by a wet-bulb thermometer often
provides an adequate approximation of the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature.
The accuracy of a simple wet-bulb thermometer depends on how fast air passes
over the bulb and how well the thermometer is shielded from the radiant
temperature of its surroundings. Speeds up to 5,000 ft/min (~60 mph) are best
but it may be dangerous to move a thermometer at that speed. Errors up to 15%
can occur if the air movement is too slow or if there is too much radiant heat
present (from sunlight, for example).
A wet bulb temperature taken with air moving at about 1â2 m/s is referred to
as a screen temperature, whereas a temperature taken with air moving about
3.5 m/s or more is referred to as sling temperature.
A psychrometer is a device that includes both a dry-bulb and a wet-bulb
thermometer. A sling psychrometer requires manual operation to create the
airflow over the bulbs, but a powered psychrometer includes a fan for this
function. Knowing both the dry-bulb temperature (DBT) and wet-bulb temperature
(WBT), one can determine the relative humidity (RH) from the psychrometric
chart appropriate to the air pressure.
**** Dew point temperature[edit] ****
Main article: Dew_point_temperature
The saturation temperature of the moisture present in the sample of air, it can
also be defined as the temperature at which the vapour changes into liquid
(condensation). Usually the level at which water vapor changes into liquid
marks the base of the cloud in the atmosphere hence called condensation level.
So the temperature value that allows this process (condensation) to take place
is called the 'dew point temperature'. A simplified definition is the
temperature at which the water vapour turns into "dew" (Chamunoda Zambuko
2012).
**** Humidity[edit] ****
Main article: Humidity
*** Specific Humidity[edit] ***
Specific humidity is defined as the proportion of the mass of water vapor and
mass of the moist air sample (including both dry air and the water vapor); it
is closely related to humidity ratio and always lower in value.
*** Absolute humidity[edit] ***
The mass of water vapor per unit volume of air containing the water vapor. This
quantity is also known as the water vapor density.[4]
*** Relative humidity[edit] ***
Main article: Relative_humidity
The ratio of the vapor pressure of moisture in the sample to the saturation
pressure at the dry bulb temperature of the sample.
**** Specific enthalpy[edit] ****
Analogous to the specific enthalpy of a pure substance. In psychrometrics, the
term quantifies the total energy of both the dry air and water vapour per
kilogram of dry air.
**** Specific volume[edit] ****
Analogous to the specific volume of a pure substance. However, in
psychrometrics, the term quantifies the total volume of both the dry air and
water vapour per unit mass of dry air.
**** Psychrometric ratio[edit] ****
The psychrometric ratio is the ratio of the heat transfer coefficient to the
product of mass transfer coefficient and humid heat at a wetted surface. It may
be evaluated with the following equation:[5][6]
         r =    h  c     k  y    c  s         {\displaystyle r={\frac {h_{c}}
      {k_{y}c_{s}}}\,}  [r={\frac {h_{c}}{k_{y}c_{s}}}\,]
      where:
                *    r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] = Psychrometric ratio,
                  dimensionless
                *     h  c     {\displaystyle h_{c}}  [h_{c}] = convective heat
                  transfer coefficient, W mâ2 Kâ1
                *     k  y     {\displaystyle k_{y}}  [k_{y}] = convective mass
                  transfer coefficient, kg mâ2 sâ1
                *     c  s     {\displaystyle c_{s}}  [c_{s}] = humid heat, J
                  kgâ1 Kâ1
The psychrometric ratio is an important property in the area of psychrometry,
as it relates the absolute humidity and saturation humidity to the difference
between the dry bulb temperature and the adiabatic_saturation_temperature.
Mixtures of air and water vapor are the most common systems encountered in
psychrometry. The psychrometric ratio of air-water vapor mixtures is
approximately unity, which implies that the difference between the adiabatic
saturation temperature and wet bulb temperature of air-water vapor mixtures is
small. This property of air-water vapor systems simplifies drying and cooling
calculations often performed using psychrometic relationships.
**** Humid heat[edit] ****
Humid heat is the constant-pressure specific heat of moist air, per unit mass
of the dry air.[7]
**** Pressure[edit] ****
Many psychrometric properties are dependent on pressure concept:
    * vapor_pressure of water;
    * atmospheric_pressure at the location of the sample.
***** Psychrometric charts[edit] *****
A psychrometric chart for sea-level elevation
**** Terminology[edit] ****
A psychrometric chart is a graph of the thermodynamic parameters of moist air
at a constant pressure, often equated to an elevation relative to sea level.
The ASHRAE-style psychrometric chart, shown here, was pioneered by Willis
Carrier in 1904.[8] It depicts these parameters and is thus a graphical
equation_of_state. The parameters are:
    * Dry-bulb_temperature (DBT) is that of an air sample, as determined by an
      ordinary thermometer. It is typically plotted as the abscissa_(horizontal
      axis) of the graph. The SI units for temperature are kelvins or degrees
      Celsius; other units are degrees_Fahrenheit and degrees_Rankine.
    * Wet-bulb_temperature (WBT) is that of an air sample after it has passed
      through a constant-pressure, ideal, adiabatic saturation process, that
      is, after the air has passed over a large surface of liquid water in an
      insulated channel. In practice this is the reading of a thermometer whose
      sensing bulb is covered with a wet sock evaporating into a rapid stream
      of the sample air (see Hygrometer). When the air sample is pre-saturated
      with water, the WBT will read the same as the DBT. The slope of the line
      of constant WBT reflects the heat of vaporization of the water required
      to saturate the air of a given relative humidity.
    * Dew_point temperature (DPT) is the temperature at which a moist air
      sample at the same pressure would reach water vapor "saturation." At this
      point further removal of heat would result in water vapor condensing into
      liquid water fog or, if below freezing_point, solid hoarfrost. The dew
      point temperature is measured easily and provides useful information, but
      is normally not considered an independent property of the air sample as
      it duplicates information available via other humidity properties and the
      saturation curve.
    * Relative_humidity (RH) is the ratio of the mole fraction of water vapor
      to the mole fraction of saturated moist air at the same temperature and
      pressure. RH is dimensionless, and is usually expressed as a percentage.
      Lines of constant RH reflect the physics of air and water: they are
      determined via experimental measurement. The concept that air "holds"
      moisture, or that moisture "dissolves" in dry air and saturates the
      solution at some proportion, is erroneous (albeit widespread); see
      relative_humidity for further details.
    * Humidity_ratio is the proportion of mass of water vapor per unit mass of
      dry air at the given conditions (DBT, WBT, DPT, RH, etc.). It is also
      known as the moisture content or mixing ratio. It is typically plotted as
      the ordinate_(vertical_axis) of the graph. For a given DBT there will be
      a particular humidity ratio for which the air sample is at 100% relative
      humidity: the relationship reflects the physics of water and air and must
      be determined by measurement. The dimensionless humidity ratio is
      typically expressed as grams of water per kilogram of dry air, or grains
      of water per pound of air (7000 grains equal 1 pound).
    * Specific_enthalpy, symbolized by h, is the sum of the internal (heat)
      energy of the moist air in question, including the heat of the air and
      water vapor within. Also called heat content per unit mass. In the
      approximation of ideal gases, lines of constant enthalpy are parallel to
      lines of constant WBT. Enthalpy is given in (SI) joules per kilogram of
      air, or BTU per pound of dry air.
    * Specific volume is the volume of the mixture (dry air plus the water
      vapor) containing one unit of mass of "dry air". The SI units are cubic
      meters per kilogram of dry air; other units are cubic feet per pound of
      dry air. The inverse of specific volume is usually confused as the
      density of the mixture (see "Applying the Psychrometric Relationships"
      CIBSE, August 2009). However, to obtain the actual mixture density one
      must multiply the inverse of the specific volume by unity plus the
      humidity ratio value at the point of interest (see ASHRAE Fundamentals
      1989 6.6, equation 9).
The psychrometric chart allows all the parameters of some moist air to be
determined from any three independent parameters, one of which must be the
pressure. Changes in state, such as when two air streams mix, can be modeled
easily and somewhat graphically using the correct psychrometric chart for the
location's air pressure or elevation relative to sea level. For locations at
not more than 2000 ft (600 m) of altitude it is common practice to use the sea-
level psychrometric chart.
In the Ï-t chart, the dry bulb temperature (t) appears as the abscissa
(horizontal axis) and the humidity ratio (Ï) appear as the ordinate (vertical
axis). A chart is valid for a given air pressure (or elevation above sea
level). From any two independent ones of the six parameters dry bulb
temperature, wet bulb temperature, relative humidity, humidity ratio, specific
enthalpy, and specific volume, all the others can be determined. There are
(   6 2   )  = 15   {\displaystyle \left({6 \atop 2}\right)=15}  [\left({6
\atop 2}\right)=15] possible combinations of independent and derived
parameters.
**** Locating parameters on chart[edit] ****
* Dry bulb temperature: These lines are drawn straight, not always parallel to
each other, and slightly inclined from the vertical position. This is the
tâaxis, the abscissa (horizontal) axis. Each line represents a constant
temperature.
* Dew point temperature: From the state point follow the horizontal line of
constant humidity ratio to the intercept of 100% RH, also known as the
saturation curve. The dew point temperature is equal to the fully saturated dry
bulb or wet bulb temperatures.
* Wet bulb temperature: These lines are oblique lines that differ slightly from
the enthalpy lines. They are identically straight but are not exactly parallel
to each other. These intersect the saturation curve at DBT point.
* Relative humidity: These hyperbolic lines are shown in intervals of 10%. The
saturation curve is at 100% RH, while dry air is at 0% RH.
* Humidity ratio: These are the horizontal lines on the chart. Humidity ratio
is usually expressed as mass of moisture per mass of dry air (pounds or
kilograms of moisture per pound or kilogram of dry air, respectively). The
range is from 0 for dry air up to 0.03 (lbmw/lbma) on the right hand Ï-axis,
the ordinate or vertical axis of the chart.
* Specific enthalpy: These are oblique lines drawn diagonally downward from
left to right across the chart that are parallel to each other. These are not
parallel to wet bulb temperature lines.
* Specific volume: These are a family of equally spaced straight lines that are
nearly parallel.
The region above the saturation curve is a two-phase region that represents a
mixture of saturated moist air and liquid water, in thermal equilibrium.
The protractor on the upper left of the chart has two scales. The inner scale
represents sensible-total heat ratio (SHF). The outer scale gives the ratio of
enthalpy difference to humidity difference. This is used to establish the slope
of a condition line between two processes. The horizontal component of the
condition line is the change in sensible heat while the vertical component is
the change in latent heat.[9][10][11]
**** How to read the chart: fundamental examples[edit] ****
Psychrometric charts are available in SI (metric) and IP (U.S./Imperial) units.
They are also available in low and high temperature ranges and for different
pressures.
    * Determining relative humidity: The percent relative humidity can be
      located at the intersection of the vertical dry bulb and diagonally down
      sloping wet bulb temperature lines. Metric (SI): Using a dry bulb of
      25 Â°C and a wet bulb of 20 Â°C, read the relative humidity at
      approximately 63.5%. U.S/Imperial (IP): Using a dry bulb of 77 Â°F and a
      wet bulb of 68 Â°F, read the relative humidity at approximately 63.5%. In
      this example the humidity ratio is 0.0126 kg water per kg dry air.
    * Determining the effect of temperature change on relative humidity: For
      air of a fixed water composition or moisture ratio, find the starting
      relative humidity from the intersection of the wet and dry bulb
      temperature lines. Using the conditions from the previous example, the
      relative humidity at a different dry bulb temperatures can be found along
      the horizontal humidity ratio line of 0.0126, either in kg water per kg
      dry air or pounds water per pound dry air.
      A common variation of this problem is determining the final humidity of
      air leaving an air conditioner evaporator coil then heated to a higher
      temperature. Assume that the temperature leaving the coil is 10Â°C
      (50Â°F) and is heated to room temperature (not mixed with room air),
      which is found by following the horizontal humidity ratio from the dew
      point or saturation line to the room dry bulb temperature line and
      reading the relative humidity. In typical practice the conditioned air is
      mixed with room air that is being infiltrated with outside air.
    * Determining the amount of water to be removed or added in lowering or
      raising relative humidity: This is the difference in humidity ratio
      between the initial and final conditions times the weight of dry air.
**** Mollier diagram[edit] ****
Mollier Diagram (Chart), IP Units
The "Mollier i-x" (Enthalpy - Humidity Mixing Ratio) diagram, developed by
Richard_Mollier in 1923,[12] is an alternative psychrometric chart, preferred
by many users in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and Russia.[13]
The underlying psychrometric parameter data for the psychrometric chart and the
Mollier diagram are identical. At first glance there is little resemblance
between the charts, but if the chart is rotated by ninety degrees and looked at
in a mirror the resemblance becomes apparent. The Mollier diagram coordinates
are enthalpy and humidity ratio. The enthalpy coordinate is skewed and the
lines of constant enthalpy are parallel and evenly spaced. The ASHRAE
psychrometric charts since 1961 use similar plotting coordinates. Some
psychrometric charts use dry-bulb temperature and humidity ratio coordinates.
