(disambiguation).
"Duty" by Edmund_Leighton
A duty (from "due" meaning "that which is owing"; Old_French: deu, did, past
participle of devoir; Latin: debere, debitum, whence "debt") is a commitment or
expectation to perform some action in general or if certain circumstances
arise. A duty may arise from a system of ethics or morality, especially in an
honor_culture. Many duties are created by law, sometimes including a codified
punishment or liability for non-performance. Performing one's duty may require
some sacrifice of self-interest.
Cicero, an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work âOn Duty",
suggests that duties can come from four different sources:[1]
   1. as a result of being a human
   2. as a result of one's particular place in life (one's family, one's
      country, one's job)
   3. as a result of one's character
   4. as a result of one's own moral expectations for oneself
The specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, depending on
jurisdiction, religion, and social norms.

Lady_Feng_and_the_Bear
In most cultures, children are expected to take on duties in relation to their
families. This may take the form of behaving in such a way that upholds the
familyâs honor in the eyes of the community, entering into arranged marriages
that benefit the family's status, or caring for ailing relatives. This family-
oriented sense of duty is a particularly central aspect to the teachings of
Confucius, and is known as xiao, or filial_piety. As such, the duties of filial
piety have played an enormous role in the lives of people in eastern Asia for
centuries. For example, the painting Lady Feng and the Bear, from ancient
China, depicts the heroic act of a consort of the emperor placing herself
between her husband and a rampaging bear. This is meant to be taken as an
example of admirable filial behavior. Filial piety is considered so important
that in some cases, it outweighs other cardinal virtues: In a more modern
example, "concerns with filial piety of the same general sort that motivate
women to engage in factory work in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore,
Indonesia, and elsewhere in Asia are commonly cited by Thai prostitutes as one
of their primary rationales for working in the skin_trade".[4] The importance
of filial piety can be expressed in this quote from the Analects of Confucius:
"Yu Tzu said, 'It is rare for a man whose character is such that he is good as
a son and obedient as a young man to have the inclination to transgress against
his superiors; it is unheard of for one who has no such inclination to be
inclined to start a rebellion. The gentleman devotes his efforts to the roots,
for once the roots are established, the Way will grow there from. Being good as
a son and obedient as a young man is, perhaps, the root of a man's character'".

***** In various cultures[edit] *****
Duty varies between different cultures and continents. Duty in Asia and Latin
America is commonly more heavily weighted than in Western_culture. According to
a study done on attitudes toward family obligation:
      "Asian and Latin American adolescents possessed stronger values and
      greater expectations regarding their duty to assist, respect, and support
      their families than their peers with European backgrounds".[5]
The deeply rooted tradition of duty among both Asian and Latin American
cultures contributes to much of the strong sense of duty that exists in
comparison to western cultures. Michael Peletz discusses the concept of duty in
his book Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia:
      "Notions of filial duty â¦ are commonly invoked to mobilize the
      loyalties, labor power, and other resources children in the ostensible
      interests of the household and, in some cases, those of the lineage clan
      as a whole. Doctrines of filial piety â¦ attuned to them may thus be a
      source of great comfort and solace to the elders but they can also be
      experienced as stressful, repressive, or both by those who are enjoined
      to honor their parentsâ (and grandparentsâ) wishes and unspoken
      expectations".[6]
An arranged_marriage is an example of an expected duty in Asia and the Middle
East. In an arranged marriage relating to duty, it is expected that the wife
will move in with the husbandâs family and household to raise their children.
Patrilocal_residence is usual; rarely does the man move in with the woman, or
is the married couple allowed to start their own household and life somewhere
else. They need to provide for the entire family in labor and care for the
farms and family. Older generations rely heavily on the help from their
children's and grandchildren's families. This form of duty is in response to
keeping the lineage of a family intact and obliging to the needs of elders.
***** Criticisms of the concept[edit] *****
**** Nietzsche[edit] ****
Friedrich_Nietzsche is among the fiercest critics of the concept of duty. "What
destroys a man more quickly", he asks, "than to work, think, and feel without
inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasureâas a mere
automaton of âdutyâ?" (The_Antichrist, Â§ 11)
Nietzsche claims that the task of all higher education is "to turn men into
machines". The way to turn men into machines is to teach them to tolerate
boredom. This is accomplished, Nietzsche says, by means of the concept of duty.
(Twilight_of_the_Idols, âSkirmishes of an untimely manâ Â§ 9.29)
