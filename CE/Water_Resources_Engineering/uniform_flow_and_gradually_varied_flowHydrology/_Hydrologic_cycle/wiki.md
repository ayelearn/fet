Earth's water cycle
[File:The Water Cycle.ogv]Play_media
As the Earth's surface water evaporates, wind moves water in the air from the
sea to the land, increasing the amount of freshwater on land.

Water vapor is converted to clouds that bring fresh water to land in the form
of rain snow and sleet
[File:The Water Cycle - Following the Water.ogv]Play_media
Precipitation falls on the ground, but what happens to that water depends
greatly on the geography of the land at any particular place.
The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological cycle,
describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of
the Earth. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the
partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh_water, saline
water and atmospheric_water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic
variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to
ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of
evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface_runoff, and
subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through different forms: liquid,
solid (ice) and vapor.
The water cycle involves the exchange of energy, which leads to temperature
changes. When water evaporates, it takes up energy from its surroundings and
cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases energy and warms the
environment. These heat exchanges influence climate.
The evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes the
land with freshwater. The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals
across the globe. It is also involved in reshaping the geological features of
the Earth, through processes including erosion and sedimentation. The water
cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the
planet.

***** Description *****
The sun, which drives the water cycle, heats water in oceans and seas. Water
evaporates as water vapor into the air. Some ice and snow sublimates directly
into water vapor. Evapotranspiration is water transpired from plants and
evaporated from the soil. The water molecule H
2O has smaller molecular_mass than the major components of the atmosphere,
nitrogen and oxygen, N
2 and O
2, hence is less dense. Due to the significant difference in density, buoyancy
drives humid air higher. As altitude increases, air pressure decreases and the
temperature drops (see Gas_laws). The lower temperature causes water vapor to
condense into tiny liquid water droplets which are heavier than the air, and
fall unless supported by an updraft. A huge concentration of these droplets
over a large space up in the atmosphere become visible as cloud. Some
condensation is near ground level, and called fog.
Atmospheric_circulation moves water vapor around the globe; cloud particles
collide, grow, and fall out of the upper atmospheric layers as precipitation.
Some precipitation falls as snow or hail, sleet, and can accumulate as ice_caps
and glaciers, which can store frozen water for thousands of years. Most water
falls back into the oceans or onto land as rain, where the water flows over the
ground as surface_runoff. A portion of runoff enters rivers in valleys in the
landscape, with streamflow moving water towards the oceans. Runoff and water
emerging from the ground (groundwater) may be stored as freshwater in lakes.
Not all runoff flows into rivers; much of it soaks into the ground as
infiltration. Some water infiltrates deep into the ground and replenishes
aquifers, which can store freshwater for long periods of time. Some
infiltration stays close to the land surface and can seep back into surface-
water bodies (and the ocean) as groundwater discharge. Some groundwater finds
openings in the land surface and comes out as freshwater springs. In river
valleys and floodplains, there is often continuous water exchange between
surface water and ground water in the hyporheic_zone. Over time, the water
returns to the ocean, to continue the water cycle.
**** Processes ****
Many different processes lead to movements and phase changes in water
  Precipitation
      Condensed water vapor that falls to the Earth's surface. Most
      precipitation occurs as rain, but also includes snow, hail, fog_drip,
      graupel, and sleet.[1] Approximately 505,000 km3 (121,000 cu mi) of water
      falls as precipitation each year, 398,000 km3 (95,000 cu mi) of it over
      the oceans.[2][better source needed] The rain on land contains
      107,000 km3 (26,000 cu mi) of water per year and a snowing only 1,000 km3
      (240 cu mi).[3] 78% of global precipitation occurs over the ocean.[4]
  Canopy_interception
      The precipitation that is intercepted by plant foliage eventually
      evaporates back to the atmosphere rather than falling to the ground.
  Snowmelt
      The runoff produced by melting snow.
  Runoff
      The variety of ways by which water moves across the land. This includes
      both surface runoff and channel_runoff. As it flows, the water may seep
      into the ground, evaporate into the air, become stored in lakes or
      reservoirs, or be extracted for agricultural or other human uses.
  Infiltration
      The flow of water from the ground surface into the ground. Once
      infiltrated, the water becomes soil_moisture or groundwater.[5] A recent
      global study using water stable isotopes, however, shows that not all
      soil moisture is equally available for groundwater recharge or for plant
      transpiration.[6]
  Subsurface_flow
      The flow of water underground, in the vadose_zone and aquifers.
      Subsurface water may return to the surface (e.g. as a spring or by being
      pumped) or eventually seep into the oceans. Water returns to the land
      surface at lower elevation than where it infiltrated, under the force of
      gravity or gravity induced pressures. Groundwater tends to move slowly
      and is replenished slowly, so it can remain in aquifers for thousands of
      years.
  Evaporation
      The transformation of water from liquid to gas phases as it moves from
      the ground or bodies of water into the overlying atmosphere.[7] The
      source of energy for evaporation is primarily solar_radiation.
      Evaporation often implicitly includes transpiration from plants, though
      together they are specifically referred to as evapotranspiration. Total
      annual evapotranspiration amounts to approximately 505,000 km3
      (121,000 cu mi) of water, 434,000 km3 (104,000 cu mi) of which evaporates
      from the oceans.[2] 86% of global evaporation occurs over the ocean.[4]
  Sublimation
      The state change directly from solid water (snow or ice) to water vapor
      by passing the liquid state.[8]
  Deposition
      This refers to changing of water vapor directly to ice.
  Advection
      The movement of water through the atmosphere.[9] Without advection, water
      that evaporated over the oceans could not precipitate over land.
  Condensation
      The transformation of water vapor to liquid water droplets in the air,
      creating clouds and fog.[10]
  Transpiration
      The release of water vapor from plants and soil into the air.
  Percolation
      Water flows vertically through the soil and rocks under the influence of
      gravity.
  Plate_tectonics
      Water enters the mantle via subduction of oceanic crust. Water returns to
      the surface via volcanism.
The water cycle involves many of these processes.
***** Residence times *****
                                 Average reservoir residence times[11]
                         Reservoir                       Average residence time
                         Antarctica                      20,000 years
                         Oceans                          3,200 years
                         Glaciers                        20 to 100 years
                         Seasonal snow cover             2 to 6 months
                         Soil moisture                   1 to 2 months
                         Groundwater: shallow            100 to 200 years
                         Groundwater: deep               10,000 years
                         Lakes (see lake_retention_time) 50 to 100 years
                         Rivers                          2 to 6 months
                         Atmosphere                      9 days
The residence_time of a reservoir within the hydrologic cycle is the average
time a water molecule will spend in that reservoir (see adjacent table). It is
a measure of the average age of the water in that reservoir.
Groundwater can spend over 10,000 years beneath Earth's surface before leaving.
Particularly old groundwater is called fossil_water. Water stored in the soil
remains there very briefly, because it is spread thinly across the Earth, and
is readily lost by evaporation, transpiration, stream flow, or groundwater
recharge. After evaporating, the residence time in the atmosphere is about 9
days before condensing and falling to the Earth as precipitation.
The major ice sheets â Antarctica and Greenland â store ice for very long
periods. Ice from Antarctica has been reliably dated to 800,000 years before
present, though the average residence time is shorter.[12]
In hydrology, residence times can be estimated in two ways. The more common
method relies on the principle of conservation_of_mass and assumes the amount
of water in a given reservoir is roughly constant. With this method, residence
times are estimated by dividing the volume of the reservoir by the rate by
which water either enters or exits the reservoir. Conceptually, this is
equivalent to timing how long it would take the reservoir to become filled from
empty if no water were to leave (or how long it would take the reservoir to
empty from full if no water were to enter).
An alternative method to estimate residence times, which is gaining in
popularity for dating groundwater, is the use of isotopic techniques. This is
done in the subfield of isotope_hydrology.
***** Changes over time *****

capacity), forced by annual mean insolation.

The water cycle describes the processes that drive the movement of water
throughout the hydrosphere. However, much more water is "in storage" for long
periods of time than is actually moving through the cycle. The storehouses for
the vast majority of all water on Earth are the oceans. It is estimated that of
the 332,500,000 mi3 (1,386,000,000 km3) of the world's water supply, about
321,000,000 mi3 (1,338,000,000 km3) is stored in oceans, or about 97%. It is
also estimated that the oceans supply about 90% of the evaporated water that
goes into the water cycle.[13]
During colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers form, and enough of
the global water supply accumulates as ice to lessen the amounts in other parts
of the water cycle. The reverse is true during warm periods. During the last
ice age, glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth's land mass with the result
being that the oceans were about 122 m (400 ft) lower than today. During the
last global "warm spell," about 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 5.5 m
(18 ft) higher than they are now. About three million years ago the oceans
could have been up to 50 m (165 ft) higher.[13]
The scientific consensus expressed in the 2007 Intergovernmental_Panel_on
Climate_Change (IPCC) Summary for Policymakers is for the water cycle to
continue to intensify throughout the 21st century, though this does not mean
that precipitation will increase in all regions.[14] In subtropical land
areas – places that are already relatively dry – precipitation is projected to
decrease during the 21st century, increasing the probability of drought. The
drying is projected to be strongest near the poleward margins of the subtropics
(for example, the Mediterranean Basin, South Africa, southern Australia, and
the Southwestern_United_States). Annual precipitation amounts are expected to
increase in near-equatorial regions that tend to be wet in the present climate,
and also at high latitudes. These large-scale patterns are present in nearly
all of the climate_model simulations conducted at several international
research centers as part of the 4th Assessment of the IPCC. There is now ample
evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and
will continue to have a profound impact on the water sector through the
hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the
global, regional, basin, and local levels.[15] Research published in 2012 in
Science based on surface ocean salinity over the period 1950 to 2000 confirm
this projection of an intensified global water cycle with salty areas becoming
more saline and fresher areas becoming more fresh over the period:[16]
     Fundamental thermodynamics and climate models suggest that dry
     regions will become drier and wet regions will become wetter in
     response to warming. Efforts to detect this long-term response in
     sparse surface observations of rainfall and evaporation remain
     ambiguous. We show that ocean salinity patterns express an
     identifiable fingerprint of an intensifying water cycle. Our 50-year
     observed global surface salinity changes, combined with changes from
     global climate models, present robust evidence of an intensified
     global water cycle at a rate of 8 Â± 5% per degree of surface
     warming. This rate is double the response projected by current-
     generation climate models and suggests that a substantial (16 to 24%)
     intensification of the global water cycle will occur in a future 2Â°
     to 3Â° warmer world.[17]
An instrument carried by the SAC-D satellite Aquarius, launched in June, 2011,
measured global sea surface salinity.[16][18]
Glacial_retreat is also an example of a changing water cycle, where the supply
of water to glaciers from precipitation cannot keep up with the loss of water
from melting and sublimation. Glacial_retreat_since_1850 has been extensive.
[19]
Human activities that alter the water cycle include:
    * agriculture
    * industry
    * alteration of the chemical composition of the atmosphere
    * construction of dams
    * deforestation and afforestation
    * removal of groundwater from wells
    * water_abstraction from rivers
    * urbanization
***** Effects on climate *****
The water cycle is powered from solar energy. 86% of the global evaporation
occurs from the oceans, reducing their temperature by evaporative_cooling.[20]
Without the cooling, the effect of evaporation on the greenhouse_effect would
lead to a much higher surface temperature of 67 Â°C (153 Â°F), and a warmer
planet.[citation_needed]
Aquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water increases the
total amount of water in the hydrosphere, and has been postulated to be a
contributor to sea-level rise.[21]
***** Effects on biogeochemical cycling *****
While the water cycle is itself a biogeochemical_cycle, flow of water over and
beneath the Earth is a key component of the cycling of other biogeochemicals.
[22] Runoff is responsible for almost all of the transport of eroded sediment
and phosphorus from land to waterbodies.[23] The salinity of the oceans is
derived from erosion and transport of dissolved salts from the land. Cultural
eutrophication of lakes is primarily due to phosphorus, applied in excess to
agricultural_fields in fertilizers, and then transported overland and down
rivers. Both runoff and groundwater flow play significant roles in transporting
nitrogen from the land to waterbodies.[24] The dead_zone at the outlet of the
Mississippi_River is a consequence of nitrates from fertilizer being carried
off agricultural fields and funnelled down the river_system to the Gulf_of
Mexico. Runoff also plays a part in the carbon_cycle, again through the
transport of eroded rock and soil.[25]
***** Slow loss over geologic time *****
Main article: Atmospheric_escape
The hydrodynamic wind within the upper portion of a planet's atmosphere allows
light chemical elements such as Hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower
limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape_velocity,
entering outer_space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas
loss from a planet into space is known as planetary_wind.[26] Planets with hot
lower atmospheres could result in humid upper atmospheres that accelerate the
loss of hydrogen.[27]
***** History of hydrologic cycle theory *****
**** Floating land mass ****
In ancient times, it was widely thought that the land mass floated on a body of
water, and that most of the water in rivers has its origin under the earth.
Examples of this belief can be found in the works of Homer (circa 800 BCE).
**** Hebrew Bible ****
In the ancient near east, Hebrew scholars observed that even though the rivers
ran into the sea, the sea never became full. Some scholars conclude that the
water cycle was described completely during this time in this passage: "The
wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth
about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits. All
the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place from
whence the rivers come, thither they return again" (, KJV).[28] Scholars are
not in agreement as to the date of Ecclesiastes, though most scholars point to
a date during the time of King_Solomon, son of David and Bathsheba, "three
thousand years ago,[28] there is some agreement that the time period is
962â922 BCE.[29] Furthermore, it was also observed that when the clouds were
full, they emptied rain on the earth (). In addition, during 793â740 BCE a
Hebrew prophet, Amos, stated that water comes from the sea and is poured out on
the earth (, ).[30]
In the Biblical Book_of_Job, dated between 7th and 2nd centuries BCE,[29] there
is a description of precipitation in the hydrologic cycle,[28] "For he maketh
small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof;
Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly" (, KJV).
**** Precipitation and percolation ****
In the Adityahridayam (a devotional hymn to the Sun God) of Ramayana, a Hindu
epic dated to the 4th century BCE, it is mentioned in the 22nd verse that the
Sun heats up water and sends it down as rain. By roughly 500 BCE, Greek
scholars were speculating that much of the water in rivers can be attributed to
rain. The origin of rain was also known by then. These scholars maintained the
belief, however, that water rising up through the earth contributed a great
deal to rivers. Examples of this thinking included Anaximander (570 BCE) (who
also speculated about the evolution_of_land_animals_from_fish[31]) and
Xenophanes_of_Colophon (530 BCE).[32] Chinese scholars such as Chi Ni Tzu (320
BCE) and Lu Shih Ch'un Ch'iu (239 BCE) had similar thoughts.[33] The idea that
the water cycle is a closed cycle can be found in the works of Anaxagoras_of
Clazomenae (460 BCE) and Diogenes_of_Apollonia (460 BCE). Both Plato (390 BCE)
and Aristotle (350 BCE) speculated about percolation as part of the water
cycle.
**** Precipitation alone ****
Up to the time of the Renaissance, it was thought that precipitation alone was
insufficient to feed rivers, for a complete water cycle, and that underground
water pushing upwards from the oceans were the main contributors to river
water. Bartholomew_of_England held this view (1240 CE), as did Leonardo da
Vinci (1500 CE) and Athanasius_Kircher (1644 CE).
The first published thinker to assert that rainfall alone was sufficient for
the maintenance of rivers was Bernard_Palissy (1580 CE), who is often credited
as the "discoverer" of the modern theory of the water cycle. Palissy's theories
were not tested scientifically until 1674, in a study commonly attributed to
Pierre_Perrault. Even then, these beliefs were not accepted in mainstream
science until the early nineteenth century.[34]
