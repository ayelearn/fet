Shearing in continuum_mechanics refers to the occurrence of a shear strain,
which is a deformation of a material substance in which parallel internal
surfaces slide past one another. It is induced by a shear_stress in the
material. Shear strain is distinguished from volumetric strain, the change in a
material's volume in response to stress.
***** Overview[edit] *****
Often, the verb shearing refers more specifically to a mechanical process that
causes a plastic shear strain in a material, rather than causing a merely
elastic one. A plastic shear strain is a continuous (non-fracturing)
deformation that is irreversible, such that the material does not recover its
original shape. It occurs when the material is yielding. The process of
shearing a material may induce a volumetric strain along with the shear strain.
In soil_mechanics, the volumetric strain associated with shearing is known as
Reynolds'_dilation if it increases the volume, or compaction if it decreases
the volume.
The shear center (also known as the elastic axis or torsional axis) is an
imaginary point on a section, where a shear force can be applied without
inducing any torsion. In general, the shear center is not the centroid. For
cross-sectional areas having one axis of symmetry, the shear center is located
on the axis of symmetry. For those having two axes of symmetry, the shear
center lies on the centroid of the cross-section.
In some materials such as metals, plastics, or granular_materials like sand or
soils, the shearing motion rapidly localizes into a narrow band, known as a
shear_band. In that case, all the sliding occurs within the band while the
blocks of material on either side of the band simply slide past one another
without internal deformation. A special case of shear localization occurs in
brittle materials when they fracture along a narrow band. Then, all subsequent
shearing occurs within the fracture. Plate_tectonics, where the plates of the
Earth's crust slide along fracture zones, is an example of this.
Shearing in soil mechanics is measured with a triaxial_shear_test or a direct
shear_test.
