Boston's Big_Dig presented geotechnical challenges in an urban environment.
Geotechnical engineering is the branch of civil_engineering concerned with the
engineering behavior of earth_materials. Geotechnical engineering is important
in civil engineering, but also has applications in military, mining, petroleum
and other engineering_disciplines that are concerned with construction
occurring on the surface or within the ground. Geotechnical engineering uses
principles of soil_mechanics and rock_mechanics to investigate subsurface
conditions and materials; determine the relevant physical/mechanical and
chemical properties of these materials; evaluate stability_of_natural_slopes
and man-made soil deposits; assess risks posed by site conditions; design
earthworks and structure foundations; and monitor site conditions, earthwork
and foundation construction.[1][2]
A typical geotechnical engineering project begins with a review of project
needs to define the required material properties. Then follows a site
investigation of soil, rock, fault distribution and bedrock properties on and
below an area of interest to determine their engineering properties including
how they will interact with, on or in a proposed construction. Site
investigations are needed to gain an understanding of the area in or on which
the engineering will take place. Investigations can include the assessment of
the risk to humans, property and the environment from natural hazards such as
earthquakes, landslides, sinkholes, soil_liquefaction, debris_flows and
rockfalls.
A geotechnical engineer then determines and designs the type of foundations,
earthworks, and/or pavement subgrades required for the intended man-made
structures to be built. Foundations are designed and constructed for structures
of various sizes such as high-rise buildings, bridges, medium to large
commercial buildings, and smaller structures where the soil conditions do not
allow code-based design.
Foundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep
foundations. Retaining structures include earth-filled dams and retaining
walls. Earthworks include embankments, tunnels, dikes_and_levees, channels,
reservoirs, deposition of hazardous_waste and sanitary landfills. Geotechnical
engineers are extensively involved in earthen and concrete dam projects,
evaluating the subsurface conditions at the dam site and the side slopes of the
reservoir, the seepage conditions under and around the dam and the stability of
the dam under a range of normal and extreme loading conditions.
Geotechnical engineering is also related to coastal and ocean_engineering.
Coastal engineering can involve the design and construction of wharves,
marinas, and jetties. Ocean engineering can involve foundation and anchor
systems for offshore_structures such as oil_platforms.
The fields of geotechnical engineering and engineering_geology are closely
related, and have large areas of overlap. However, the field of geotechnical
engineering is a specialty of engineering, where the field of engineering
geology is a specialty of geology. Coming from the fields of engineering and
science, respectively, the two may approach the same subject, such as soil
classification, with different methods.

***** History[edit] *****
Humans have historically used soil as a material for flood control, irrigation
purposes, burial sites, building foundations, and as construction material for
buildings. First activities were linked to irrigation and flood control, as
demonstrated by traces of dykes, dams, and canals dating back to at least 2000
BCE that were found in ancient Egypt, ancient Mesopotamia and the Fertile
Crescent, as well as around the early settlements of Mohenjo_Daro and Harappa
in the Indus_valley. As the cities expanded, structures were erected supported
by formalized foundations; Ancient_Greeks notably constructed pad footings and
strip-and-raft_foundations. Until the 18th century, however, no theoretical
basis for soil design had been developed and the discipline was more of an art
than a science, relying on past experience.[3]
Several foundation-related engineering problems, such as the Leaning_Tower_of
Pisa, prompted scientists to begin taking a more scientific-based approach to
examining the subsurface. The earliest advances occurred in the development of
earth_pressure theories for the construction of retaining_walls. Henri Gautier,
a French Royal Engineer, recognized the "natural slope" of different soils in
1717, an idea later known as the soil's angle_of_repose. A rudimentary soil
classification system was also developed based on a material's unit weight,
which is no longer considered a good indication of soil type.[3][4]
The application of the principles of mechanics to soils was documented as early
as 1773 when Charles_Coulomb (a physicist, engineer, and army Captain)
developed improved methods to determine the earth pressures against military
ramparts. Coulomb observed that, at failure, a distinct slip plane would form
behind a sliding retaining wall and he suggested that the maximum shear stress
on the slip plane, for design purposes, was the sum of the soil cohesion,     c
{\displaystyle c}  [c], and friction     &#x03C3;     {\displaystyle \sigma
\,\!}  [\sigma \,\!]     tan &#x2061; ( &#x03D5;   )   {\displaystyle \tan(\phi
\,\!)}  [\tan(\phi \,\!)], where     &#x03C3;     {\displaystyle \sigma \,\!}
[\sigma \,\!] is the normal stress on the slip plane and     &#x03D5;
{\displaystyle \phi \,\!}  [\phi \,\!] is the friction angle of the soil. By
combining Coulomb's theory with Christian_Otto_Mohr's 2D_stress_state, the
theory became known as Mohr-Coulomb_theory. Although it is now recognized that
precise determination of cohesion is impossible because     c   {\displaystyle
c}  [c] is not a fundamental soil property,[5] the Mohr-Coulomb theory is still
used in practice today.
In the 19th century Henry_Darcy developed what is now known as Darcy's_Law
describing the flow of fluids in porous media. Joseph_Boussinesq (a
mathematician and physicist) developed theories of stress distribution in
elastic solids that proved useful for estimating stresses at depth in the
ground; William_Rankine, an engineer and physicist, developed an alternative to
Coulomb's earth pressure theory. Albert_Atterberg developed the clay
consistency indices that are still used today for soil classification.[3][4]
Osborne_Reynolds recognized in 1885 that shearing causes volumetric dilation of
dense and contraction of loose granular materials.
Modern geotechnical engineering is said to have begun in 1925 with the
publication of Erdbaumechanik by Karl_Terzaghi (a mechanical engineer and
geologist). Considered by many to be the father of modern soil mechanics and
geotechnical engineering, Terzaghi developed the principle of effective stress,
and demonstrated that the shear strength of soil is controlled by effective
stress. Terzaghi also developed the framework for theories of bearing capacity
of foundations, and the theory for prediction of the rate of settlement of clay
layers due to consolidation.[3][5][6] In his 1948 book, Donald Taylor
recognized that interlocking and dilation of densely packed particles
contributed to the peak strength of a soil. The interrelationships between
volume change behavior (dilation, contraction, and consolidation) and shearing
behavior were all connected via the theory of plasticity using critical_state
soil_mechanics by Roscoe, Schofield, and Wroth with the publication of "On the
Yielding of Soils" in 1958. Critical_state_soil_mechanics is the basis for many
contemporary advanced constitutive_models describing the behavior of soil.[7]
Geotechnical_centrifuge_modeling is a method of testing physical scale models
of geotechnical problems. The use of a centrifuge enhances the similarity of
the scale model tests involving soil because the strength and stiffness of soil
is very sensitive to the confining pressure. The centrifugal acceleration
allows a researcher to obtain large (prototype-scale) stresses in small
physical models.
***** Practicing engineers[edit] *****
Geotechnical engineers are typically graduates of a four-year civil engineering
program and some hold a masters_degree. In the US, geotechnical engineers are
typically licensed and regulated as Professional Engineers (PEs) in most
states; currently only California and Oregon have licensed geotechnical
engineering specialties. The Academy_of_Geo-Professionals (AGP) began issuing
Diplomate, Geotechnical Engineering (D.GE) certification in 2008. State
governments will typically license engineers who have graduated from an ABET
accredited school, passed the Fundamentals_of_Engineering examination,
completed several years of work experience under the supervision of a licensed
Professional Engineer, and passed the Professional_Engineering examination.[8]
***** Soil mechanics[edit] *****
A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water,
and voids.
Main articles: Soil_mechanics and Rock_mechanics
In geotechnical engineering, soils are considered a three-phase material
composed of: rock or mineral particles, water and air. The voids of a soil, the
spaces in between mineral particles, contain the water and air.
The engineering properties of soils are affected by four main factors: the
predominant size of the mineral particles, the type of mineral particles, the
grain size distribution, and the relative quantities of mineral, water and air
present in the soil matrix. Fine particles (fines) are defined as particles
less than 0.075 mm in diameter.
**** Soil properties[edit] ****
Main article: Soil_mechanics
Some of the important properties of soils that are used by geotechnical
engineers to analyze site conditions and design earthworks, retaining
structures, and foundations are:[2]
  Specific_weight_or_Unit_Weight
      Cumulative weight of the solid particles, water and air of the unit
      volume of soil. Note that the air phase is often assumed to be
      weightless.
  Porosity
      Ratio of the volume of voids (containing air, water, or other fluids) in
      a soil to the total volume of the soil. Porosity is mathematically
      related to void ratio the by[9]
   n =   e  1 + e      {\displaystyle n={\frac {e}{1+e}}}  [
n=\frac{e}{1+e}
]
      here e is void ratio and n is porosity
  Void_ratio
      The ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solid particles in a
      soil mass. Void ratio is mathematically related to the porosity by[9]
   e =   n  1 &#x2212; n      {\displaystyle e={\frac {n}{1-n}}}  [
e=\frac{n}{1-n}
]
  Permeability
      A measure of the ability of water to flow through the soil. It is
      expressed in units of darcies (d). Permeability of 1 d allows the flow of
      1 cm3 per second of fluid with 1 cP (centipoise) viscosity through a
      cross-sectional area of 1 cm2 when a pressure gradient of 1 atm/cm is
      applied.[10]
  Compressibility
      The rate of change of volume with effective stress. If the pores are
      filled with water, then the water must be squeezed out of the pores to
      allow volumetric compression of the soil; this process is called
      consolidation.
  Shear_strength
      The maximum shear_stress that can be applied in a soil mass without
      causing shear failure.[11]
  Atterberg_Limits
      Liquid_limit, Plastic_limit, and Shrinkage_limit. These indices are used
      for estimation of other engineering properties and for soil
      classification.

Main article: Geotechnical_investigation
Geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists perform geotechnical
investigations to obtain information on the physical properties of soil and
rock underlying (and sometimes adjacent to) a site to design earthworks and
foundations for proposed structures, and for the repair of distress to
earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. A geotechnical
investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a
site. Sometimes, geophysical_methods are used to obtain data about sites.
Subsurface exploration usually involves in-situ testing (two common examples of
in-situ tests are the standard_penetration_test and cone_penetration_test). In
addition site investigation will often include subsurface sampling and
laboratory testing of the soil samples retrieved. The digging of test pits and
trenching (particularly for locating faults and slide_planes) may also be used
to learn about soil conditions at depth. Large diameter borings are rarely used
due to safety concerns and expense but are sometimes used to allow a geologist
or engineer to be lowered into the borehole for direct visual and manual
examination of the soil and rock stratigraphy.
A variety of soil_samplers exists to meet the needs of different engineering
projects. The standard_penetration_test (SPT), which uses a thick-walled split
spoon sampler, is the most common way to collect disturbed samples. Piston
samplers, employing a thin-walled tube, are most commonly used for the
collection of less disturbed samples. More advanced methods, such as ground
freezing and the Sherbrooke block sampler, are superior, but even more
expensive.
Atterberg_limits tests, water_content measurements, and grain size analysis,
for example, may be performed on disturbed samples obtained from thick-walled
soil_samplers. Properties such as shear strength, stiffness hydraulic
conductivity, and coefficient of consolidation may be significantly altered by
sample disturbance. To measure these properties in the laboratory, high-quality
sampling is required. Common tests to measure the strength and stiffness
include the triaxial_shear and unconfined compression test.
Surface exploration can include geologic_mapping, geophysical_methods, and
photogrammetry; or it can be as simple as an engineer walking around to observe
the physical conditions at the site. Geologic mapping and interpretation of
geomorphology are typically completed in consultation with a geologist or
engineering_geologist.
Geophysical_exploration is also sometimes used. Geophysical techniques used for
subsurface exploration include measurement of seismic_waves (pressure, shear,
and Rayleigh_waves), surface-wave methods and/or downhole methods, and
electromagnetic surveys (magnetometer, resistivity, and ground-penetrating
radar).

Main article: Foundation_(engineering)
A building's foundation transmits loads from buildings and other structures to
the earth. Geotechnical engineers design foundations based on the load
characteristics of the structure and the properties of the soils and/or bedrock
at the site. In general, geotechnical engineers:
   1. Estimate the magnitude and location of the loads to be supported.
   2. Develop an investigation plan to explore_the_subsurface.
   3. Determine necessary soil parameters through field and lab testing (e.g.,
      consolidation_test, triaxial_shear_test, vane shear test, standard
      penetration_test).
   4. Design the foundation in the safest and most economical manner.
The primary considerations for foundation support are bearing_capacity,
settlement, and ground movement beneath the foundations. Bearing capacity is
the ability of the site soils to support the loads imposed by buildings or
structures. Settlement occurs under all foundations in all soil conditions,
though lightly loaded structures or rock sites may experience negligible
settlements. For heavier structures or softer sites, both overall settlement
relative to unbuilt areas or neighboring buildings, and differential settlement
under a single structure can be concerns. Of particular concern is a settlement
which occurs over time, as immediate settlement can usually be compensated for
during construction. Ground movement beneath a structure's foundations can
occur due to shrinkage or swell of expansive soils due to climatic changes,
frost expansion of soil, melting of permafrost, slope instability, or other
causes.[citation_needed] All these factors must be considered during the design
of foundations.
Many building codes specify basic foundation design parameters for simple
conditions, frequently varying by jurisdiction, but such design techniques are
normally limited to certain types of construction and certain types of sites
and are frequently very conservative.[citation_needed]
In areas of shallow bedrock, most foundations may bear directly on bedrock; in
other areas, the soil may provide sufficient strength for the support of
structures. In areas of deeper bedrock with soft overlying soils, deep
foundations are used to support structures directly on the bedrock; in areas
where bedrock is not economically available, stiff "bearing layers" are used to
support deep foundations instead.

Main article: Shallow_foundation
Example of a slab-on-grade foundation.
Shallow foundations are a type of foundation that transfers the building load
to the very near the surface, rather than to a subsurface layer. Shallow
foundations typically have a depth to width ratio of less than 1.
*** Footings[edit] ***
Footings (often called "spread footings" because they spread the load) are
structural elements which transfer structure loads to the ground by direct
areal contact. Footings can be isolated footings for point or column loads or
strip footings for wall or another long (line) loads. Footings are normally
constructed from reinforced_concrete cast directly onto the soil and are
typically embedded into the ground to penetrate through the zone of frost
movement and/or to obtain additional bearing capacity.
*** Slab foundations[edit] ***
A variant on spread footings is to have the entire structure bear on a single
slab of concrete underlying the entire area of the structure. Slabs must be
thick enough to provide sufficient rigidity to spread the bearing loads
somewhat uniformly and to minimize differential settlement across the
foundation. In some cases, flexure is allowed and the building is constructed
to tolerate small movements of the foundation instead. For small structures,
like single-family houses, the slab may be less than 300  mm thick; for larger
structures, the foundation slab may be several meters thick.
Slab foundations can be either slab-on-grade_foundations or embedded
foundations, typically in buildings with basements. Slab-on-grade foundations
must be designed to allow for potential ground movement due to changing soil
conditions.

Pile-driving for a bridge in Napa,_California.
Main article: Deep_foundations
Deep foundations are used for structures or heavy loads when shallow
foundations cannot provide adequate capacity, due to size and structural
limitations. They may also be used to transfer building loads past weak or
compressible soil layers. While shallow foundations rely solely on the bearing
capacity of the soil beneath them, deep foundations can rely on end bearing
resistance, frictional resistance along their length, or both in developing the
required capacity. Geotechnical engineers use specialized tools, such as the
cone_penetration_test, to estimate the amount of skin and end bearing
resistance available in the subsurface.
There are many types of deep foundations including piles, drilled shafts,
caissons, piers, and earth stabilized columns. Large buildings such as
skyscrapers typically require deep foundations. For example, the Jin_Mao_Tower
in China uses tubular steel piles about 1m (3.3  feet) driven to a depth of
83.5m (274  feet) to support its weight.
In buildings that are constructed and found to undergo settlement, underpinning
piles can be used to stabilize the existing building.[citation_needed]
There are three ways to place piles for a deep foundation. They can be driven,
drilled, or installed by the use of an auger. Driven piles are extended to
their necessary depths with the application of external energy in the same way
a nail is hammered. There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles:
drop hammers, diesel hammers, hydraulic hammers, and air hammers. Drop hammers
simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use
a single-cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly,
hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air
forces. The energy imparted from a hammerhead varies with the type of hammer
chosen and can be as high as a million-foot pounds for large scale diesel
hammers, a very common hammerhead used in practice. Piles are made of a variety
of material including steel, timber, and concrete. Drilled piles are created by
first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete.
Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a
larger diameter pile. The auger method of pile installation is similar to
drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is
being removed.[12]
***** Lateral earth support structures[edit] *****

Main article: Retaining_wall
A retaining wall is a structure that holds back earth. Retaining walls
stabilize soil and rock from downslope movement or erosion and provide support
for vertical or near-vertical grade changes. Cofferdams and bulkheads,
structures to hold back water, are sometimes also considered retaining walls.
The primary geotechnical concern in design and installation of retaining walls
is that the weight of the retained material is creates lateral_earth_pressure
behind the wall, which can cause the wall to deform or fail. The lateral earth
pressure depends on the height of the wall, the density of the soil, the
strength of the soil, and the amount of allowable movement of the wall. This
pressure is smallest at the top and increases toward the bottom in a manner
similar to hydraulic pressure, and tends to push the wall away from the
backfill. Groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage
system causes an additional horizontal hydraulic pressure on the wall.
**** Gravity walls[edit] ****
Gravity walls depend on the size and weight of the wall mass to resist
pressures from behind. Gravity walls will often have a slight setback, or
batter, to improve wall stability. For short, landscaping walls, gravity walls
made from dry-stacked (mortarless) stone or segmental concrete units (masonry
units) are commonly used.
Earlier in the 20th century, taller retaining walls were often gravity walls
made from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller retaining walls are
increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as geosynthetic or steel-
reinforced backfill soil with precast facing; gabions (stacked steel wire
baskets filled with rocks), crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from
precast concrete or timber and filled with soil or free-draining gravel) or
soil-nailed walls (soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods).
For reinforced-soil gravity walls, the soil reinforcement is placed in
horizontal layers throughout the height of the wall. Commonly, the soil
reinforcement is geogrid, a high-strength polymer mesh, that provides tensile
strength to hold the soil together. The wall face is often of precast,
segmental concrete units that can tolerate some differential movement. The
reinforced soil's mass, along with the facing, becomes the gravity wall. The
reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the
soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 30 to 40 percent as
deep (thick) as the height of the wall and may have to be larger if there is a
slope or surcharge on the wall.
**** Cantilever walls[edit] ****
Prior to the introduction of modern reinforced-soil gravity walls, cantilevered
walls were the most common type of taller retaining wall. Cantilevered walls
are made from a relatively thin stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place
concrete or mortared masonry (often in the shape of an inverted T). These walls
cantilever loads (like a beam) to a large, structural footing; converting
horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground
below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a
counterfort on the back, to improve their stability against high loads.
Buttresses are short wing_walls at right angles to the main trend of the wall.
These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth. This
type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.
Cantilever walls resist lateral pressures by friction at the base of the wall
and/or passive earth pressure, the tendency of the soil to resist lateral
movement.
Basements are a form of cantilever walls, but the forces on the basement walls
are greater than on conventional walls because the basement wall is not free to
move.
**** Excavation shoring[edit] ****

 adding_citations_to_reliable_sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and

Shoring of temporary excavations frequently requires a wall design that does
not extend laterally beyond the wall, so shoring extends below the planned base
of the excavation. Common methods of shoring are the use of sheet piles or
soldier beams and lagging. Sheet piles are a form of driven piling using thin
interlocking sheets of steel to obtain a continuous barrier in the ground and
are driven prior to excavation. Soldier beams are constructed of wide flange
steel H sections spaced about 2â3 m apart, driven prior to excavation. As the
excavation proceeds, horizontal timber or steel sheeting (lagging) is inserted
behind the H pile flanges.
In some cases, the lateral support which can be provided by the shoring wall
alone is insufficient to resist the planned lateral loads; in this case,
additional support is provided by walers or tie-backs. Walers are structural
elements that connect across the excavation so that the loads from the soil on
either side of the excavation are used to resist each other, or which transfer
horizontal loads from the shoring wall to the base of the excavation. Tie-backs
are steel tendons drilled into the face of the wall which extends beyond the
soil which is applying pressure to the wall, to provide additional lateral
resistance to the wall.
***** Earthworks[edit] *****

See also: Earthworks_(engineering)
    * Excavation is the process of training earth according to requirement by
      removing the soil from the site.
    * Filling is the process of training earth according to requirement by
      placing the soil on the site.
    * Compaction is the process by which the density of soil is increased and
      permeability of soil is decreased. Fill placement work often has
      specifications requiring a specific degree of compaction, or
      alternatively, specific properties of the compacted soil. In-situ soils
      can be compacted by rolling, deep dynamic_compaction, vibration,
      blasting, gyrating, kneading, compaction grouting etc.
***** Ground improvement[edit] *****
Ground Improvement is a technique that improves the engineering properties of
the treated soil mass. Usually, the properties modified are shear strength,
stiffness, and permeability. Ground improvement has developed into a
sophisticated tool to support foundations for a wide variety of structures.
Properly applied, i.e. after giving due consideration to the nature of the
ground being improved and the type and sensitivity of the structures being
built, ground improvement often reduces direct costs and saves time.[13]
***** Slope stabilization[edit] *****
Simple slope slip section.
Main article: Slope_stability
Slope stability is the potential of soil covered slopes to withstand and
undergo movement. Stability is determined by the balance of shear_stress and
shear_strength. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by
preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering
factors of a slope_failure can be climatic events that can then make a slope
actively unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by
increases in shear stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient
forces. Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes
in pore_water_pressure, and organic material.
Several modes of failure for earth slopes include falls, topples, slides, and
flows. In slopes with coarse-grained soil or rocks, falls typically occur as
the rapid descent of rocks and other loose slope material. A slope topples when
a large column of soil tilts over its vertical axis at failure. Typical slope
stability analysis considers sliding failures, categorized mainly as rotational
slides or translational slides. As implied by the name, rotational slides fail
along a generally curved surface, while translational slides fail along a more
planar surface. A slope failing as flow would resemble a fluid flowing
downhill.
**** Slope stability analysis[edit] ****
Main article: Slope_stability_analysis
Stability analysis is needed for the design of engineered slopes and for
estimating the risk of slope failure in natural or designed slopes. A common
assumption is that a slope consists of a layer of soil sitting on top of a
rigid base. The mass and the base are assumed to interact via friction. The
interface between the mass and the base can be planar, curved, or have some
other complex geometry. The goal of a slope stability analysis is to determine
the conditions under which the mass will slip relative to the base and lead to
slope failure.[14]
If the interface between the mass and the base of a slope has a complex
geometry, slope stability analysis is difficult and numerical solution methods
are required. Typically, the exact geometry of the interface is not known and a
simplified interface geometry is assumed. Finite slopes require three-
dimensional models to be analyzed. To keep the problem simple, most slopes are
analyzed assuming that the slopes are infinitely wide and can, therefore, be
represented by two-dimensional models. A slope can be drained or undrained. The
undrained condition is used in the calculations to produce conservative
estimates of risk.
A popular stability analysis approach is based on principles pertaining to the
limit equilibrium concept. This method analyzes a finite or infinite slope as
if it were about to fail along its sliding failure surface. Equilibrium
stresses are calculated along the failure plane and compared to the soils shear
strength as determined by Terzaghi's_shear_strength_equation. Stability is
ultimately decided by a factor of safety equal to the ratio of shear strength
to the equilibrium stresses along the failure surface. A factor of safety
greater than one generally implies a stable slope, failure of which should not
occur assuming the slope is undisturbed. A factor of safety of 1.5 for static
conditions is commonly used in practice.
***** Offshore geotechnical engineering[edit] *****

Platforms offshore Mexico.
Offshore (or marine) geotechnical engineering is concerned with foundation
design for human-made structures in the sea, away from the coastline (in
opposition to onshore or nearshore).[15] Oil_platforms, artificial_islands and
submarine_pipelines are examples of such structures. There are a number of
significant differences between onshore and offshore geotechnical engineering.
[15][16] Notably, ground improvement (on the seabed) and site investigation are
more expensive, the offshore structures are exposed to a wider range of
geohazards, and the environmental and financial consequences are higher in case
of failure. Offshore structures are exposed to various environmental loads,
notably wind, waves and currents. These phenomena may affect the integrity or
the serviceability of the structure and its foundation during its operational
lifespan â they need to be taken into account in offshore design.
In subsea geotechnical engineering, seabed materials are considered a two-phase
material composed of 1) rock or mineral particles and 2) water.[17][18]
Structures may be fixed in place in the seabedâas is the case for piers,
jettys and fixed-bottom wind turbinesâor maybe a floating structure that
remains roughly fixed relative to its geotechnical anchor point. Undersea
mooring of human-engineered floating structures include a large number of
offshore_oil_and_gas_platforms and, since 2008, a few floating_wind_turbines.
Two common types of engineered design for anchoring floating structures include
tension-leg and catenary loose_mooring systems. "Tension leg mooring systems
have vertical tethers under tension providing large restoring moments in pitch
and roll. Catenary mooring systems provide station keeping for an offshore
structure yet provide little stiffness at low tensions."[19]
***** Geosynthetics[edit] *****
A collage of geosynthetic products.
Main article: Geosynthetics
Geosynthetics are a type of plastic polymer products used in geotechnical
engineering that improve engineering performance while reducing costs. This
includes geotextiles, geogrids, geomembranes, geocells, and geocomposites. The
synthetic nature of the products makes them suitable for use in the ground
where high levels of durability are required; their main functions include
drainage, filtration, reinforcement, separation, and containment. Geosynthetics
are available in a wide range of forms and materials, each to suit a slightly
different end-use, although they are frequently used together. These products
have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil and
geotechnical engineering applications including roads, airfields, railroads,
embankments, piled embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams,
landfills, bank protection and coastal engineering.[20][self-published_source]
