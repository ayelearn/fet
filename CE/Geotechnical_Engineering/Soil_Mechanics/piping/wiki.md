Large-scale piping system in an HVAC mechanical_room
Within industry, piping is a system of pipes used to convey fluids (liquids and
gases) from one location to another. The engineering discipline of piping
design studies the efficient transport of fluid.[1][2]
Industrial process piping (and accompanying in-line components) can be
manufactured from wood, fiberglass, glass, steel, aluminum, plastic, copper,
and concrete. The in-line components, known as fittings,[3] valves, and other
devices, typically sense and control the pressure, flow_rate and temperature of
the transmitted fluid, and usually are included in the field of piping design
(or piping engineering). Piping systems are documented in piping_and
instrumentation_diagrams (P&IDs). If necessary, pipes can be cleaned by the
tube_cleaning process.
Piping sometimes refers to piping design, the detailed specification of the
physical piping layout within a process plant or commercial building. In
earlier days, this was sometimes called drafting, technical_drawing,
engineering_drawing, and design, but is today commonly performed by designers
that have learned to use automated computer-aided drawing or computer-aided
design (CAD) software.
Plumbing is a piping system with which most people are familiar, as it
constitutes the form of fluid transportation that is used to provide potable
water and fuels to their homes and businesses. Plumbing pipes also remove waste
in the form of sewage, and allow venting of sewage gases to the outdoors. Fire
sprinkler systems also use piping, and may transport nonpotable or potable
water, or other fire-suppression fluids.
Piping also has many other industrial applications, which are crucial for
moving raw and semi-processed fluids for refining into more useful products.
Some of the more exotic materials used in pipe construction are Inconel,
titanium, chrome-moly and various other steel alloys.

***** Engineering sub-fields[edit] *****
Generally, industrial piping engineering has three major sub-fields:
    * Piping material
    * Piping design
    * Stress analysis
***** Stress analysis[edit] *****
Process piping and power piping are typically checked by pipe stress engineers
to verify that the routing, nozzle loads, hangers, and supports are properly
placed and selected such that allowable pipe stress is not exceeded under
different loads such as sustained loads, operating loads, pressure testing
loads, etc., as stipulated by the ASME B31, EN 13480, GOST 32388, RD 10-249 or
any other applicable codes and standards. It is necessary to evaluate the
mechanical behavior of the piping under regular loads (internal pressure and
thermal stresses) as well under occasional and intermittent loading cases such
as earthquake, high wind or special vibration, and water hammer.[4][5] This
evaluation is usually performed with the assistance of a specialized (finite
element) pipe stress_analysis computer programs such as AutoPIPE,[6] CAEPIPE,
[7], CAESAR[8], PASS/START-PROF.[9]
In cryogenic pipe supports, most steel become more brittle as the temperature
decreases from normal operating conditions, so it is necessary to know the
temperature distribution for cryogenic conditions. Steel structures will have
areas of high stress that may be caused by sharp corners in the design, or
inclusions in the material.[10]
***** Materials[edit] *****
The material with which a pipe is manufactured often forms as the basis for
choosing any pipe. Materials that are used for manufacturing pipes include:
    * Carbon_steel
    * ASTM A252 Spec Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 Steel Pile Pipe
    * Plastic_piping, e.g. HDPE_pipe, PP-R_pipe or LDPE pipe [11].
    * Low temperature service carbon steel
    * Stainless_steel
    * Nonferrous metals, e.g. cupro-nickel, tantalum lined, etc.
    * Nonmetallic, e.g. tempered_glass, Teflon lined, PVC, etc.
***** History[edit] *****
Early wooden pipes were constructed out of logs that had a large hole bored
lengthwise through the center.[12] Later wooden pipes were constructed with
staves and hoops similar to wooden barrel construction. Stave pipes have the
advantage that they are easily transported as a compact pile of parts on a
wagon and then assembled as a hollow structure at the job site. Wooden pipes
were especially popular in mountain regions where transport of heavy iron or
concrete pipes would have been difficult.
Wooden pipes were easier to maintain than metal, because the wood did not
expand or contract with temperature changes as much as metal and so
consequently expansion joints and bends were not required. The thickness of
wood afforded some insulating properties to the pipes which helped prevent
freezing as compared to metal pipes. Wood used for water pipes also does not
rot very easily. Electrolysis doesn't affect wood pipes at all, since wood is a
much better electrical insulator.
In the Western United States where redwood was used for pipe construction, it
was found that redwood had "peculiar properties" that protected it from
weathering, acids, insects, and fungus growths. Redwood pipes stayed smooth and
clean indefinitely while iron pipe by comparison would rapidly begin to scale
and corrode and could eventually plug itself up with the corrosion.[13]
***** Standards[edit] *****

manufacturing any piping system. Organizations that promulgate piping standards
include:
