Civil engineering is a professional_engineering discipline that deals with the
design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built
environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams,
airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and
railways.[1][2]
Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It
is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military
engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from
military engineering.[4] Civil engineering takes place in the public sector
from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from
individual homeowners through to international companies.

***** History[edit] *****
**** Civil engineering as a discipline[edit] ****
Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for
solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to
advances in the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history.
Because civil engineering is a wide-ranging profession, including several
specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures,
materials science, geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environment, mechanics
and other fields.
Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and
construction was carried out by artisans, such as stonemasons and carpenters,
rising to the role of master_builder. Knowledge was retained in guilds and
seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads, and infrastructure that
existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.[5]
One of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and
mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of Archimedes
in the 3rd century BC, including Archimedes Principle, which underpins our
understanding of buoyancy, and practical solutions such as Archimedes'_screw.
Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD,
based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.[6]
**** Civil engineering profession[edit] ****
See also: History_of_structural_engineering
Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence.
The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and
2000 BC in ancient_Egypt, the Indus_Valley_Civilization, and Mesopotamia
(ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a
need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became
increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing.
Leonhard_Euler developed the theory explaining the buckling of columns.
Until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and
architecture, and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical
variations referring to the same occupation, and often used interchangeably.[7]
The construction of pyramids in Egypt (circa 2700â2500 BC) were some of the
first instances of large structure constructions. Other ancient historic civil
engineering constructions include the Qanat water management system (the oldest
is older than 3000 years and longer than 71 km,[8]) the Parthenon by Iktinos in
Ancient_Greece (447â438 BC), the Appian_Way by Roman_engineers (c. 312 BC),
the Great_Wall_of_China by General Meng_T'ien under orders from Ch'in Emperor
Shih_Huang_Ti (c. 220 BC)[9] and the stupas constructed in ancient Sri_Lanka
like the Jetavanaramaya and the extensive irrigation works in Anuradhapura. The
Romans developed civil structures throughout their empire, including especially
aqueducts, insulae, harbors, bridges, dams and roads.
A Roman aqueduct [built circa 19 BC] near Pont_du_Gard, France
Chichen_Itza was a large pre-Columbian city in Mexico built by the Maya_people
of the Post Classic. The northeast column temple also covers a channel that
funnels all the rainwater from the complex some 40 metres (130 ft) away to a
rejollada, a former cenote.
In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all
things civilian as opposed to military engineering.[4] The first self-
proclaimed civil engineer was John_Smeaton, who constructed the Eddystone
Lighthouse.[3][9] In 1771 Smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the
Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who
met informally over dinner. Though there was evidence of some technical
meetings, it was little more than a social society.
John_Smeaton, the "father of civil engineering"
In 1818 the Institution of Civil Engineers was founded in London,[10] and in
1820 the eminent engineer Thomas_Telford became its first president. The
institution received a Royal Charter in 1828, formally recognising civil
engineering as a profession. Its charter defined civil engineering as:
     the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use
     and convenience of man, as the means of production and of traffic in
     states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the
     construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation
     and docks for internal intercourse and exchange, and in the
     construction of ports, harbours, moles, breakwaters and lighthouses,
     and in the art of navigation by artificial power for the purposes of
     commerce, and in the construction and application of machinery, and
     in the drainage of cities and towns.[11]
**** Civil engineering education[edit] ****
The first private college to teach civil engineering in the United States was
Norwich_University, founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge.[12] The first
degree in civil engineering in the United States was awarded by Rensselaer
Polytechnic_Institute in 1835.[13][14] The first such degree to be awarded to a
woman was granted by Cornell_University to Nora_Stanton_Blatch in 1905.[15]
In the UK during the early 19th century, the division between civil engineering
and military engineering (served by the Royal_Military_Academy,_Woolwich),
coupled with the demands of the Industrial Revolution, spawned new engineering
education initiatives: the Class of Civil Engineering and Mining was founded at
King's_College_London in 1838, mainly as a response to the growth of the
railway system and the need for more qualified engineers, the private College
for_Civil_Engineers in Putney was established in 1839, and the UK's first Chair
of Engineering was established at the University_of_Glasgow in 1840.
***** Education[edit] *****
Main article: Civil_engineer
Civil engineers typically possess an academic_degree in civil engineering. The
length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated
as a bachelor_of_technology, or a bachelor_of_engineering. The curriculum
generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, project_management, design
and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most
sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move on to specialize in one or more
sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc)
normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification,
some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow
students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.[16]

***** Practicing engineers[edit] *****
In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step
towards professional_certification, and a professional_body certifies the
degree program. After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must
satisfy a range of requirements including work experience and exam requirements
before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated as a
professional_engineer (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), a
chartered_engineer (in most Commonwealth countries), a chartered professional
engineer (in Australia and New_Zealand), or a European engineer (in most
countries of the European_Union). There are international agreements between
relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national
borders.
The benefits of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the
United States and Canada, "only a licensed professional_engineer may prepare,
sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority
for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients."[17]
This requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the Engineers Act in
Quebec.[18]No such legislation has been enacted in other countries including
the United Kingdom. In Australia, state licensing of engineers is limited to
the state of Queensland. Almost all certifying bodies maintain a code_of_ethics
which all members must abide by.[19]
Engineers must obey contract_law in their contractual relationships with other
parties. In cases where an engineer's work fails, they may be subject to the
law of tort_of_negligence, and in extreme cases, criminal charges.[20] An
engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such
as building_codes and environmental_law.
***** Sub-disciplines[edit] *****
The Akashi_KaikyÅ_Bridge in Japan, currently the world's longest suspension
span.
There are a number of sub-disciplines within the broad field of civil
engineering. General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and
specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, pavement, water
supply, sewer service, dams, electric and communications supply. General civil
engineering is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil
engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage
to another. Site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with
stakeholders, and preparing construction plans. Civil engineers apply the
principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental
engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to
residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and
levels of construction.
**** Coastal engineering[edit] ****
Main articles: Coastal_engineering and Coastal_management
Oosterscheldekering, a storm_surge_barrier in the Netherlands.
Coastal engineering is concerned with managing coastal areas. In some
jurisdictions, the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense
against flooding and erosion, respectively. The term coastal defense is the
more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the
field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land.
**** Construction engineering[edit] ****
Main article: Construction_engineering
Construction engineering involves planning and execution, transportation of
materials, site development based on hydraulic, environmental, structural and
geotechnical engineering. As construction firms tend to have higher business
risk than other types of civil engineering firms do, construction engineers
often engage in more business-like transactions, for example, drafting and
reviewing contracts, evaluating logistical_operations, and monitoring prices of
supplies.
**** Earthquake engineering[edit] ****
Main article: Earthquake_engineering
Earthquake engineering involves designing structures to withstand hazardous
earthquake exposures. Earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural
engineering. The main objectives of earthquake engineering are[21] to
understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground; foresee the
consequences of possible earthquakes; and design, construct and maintain
structures to perform at earthquake in compliance with building_codes.
**** Environmental engineering[edit] ****
Main article: Environmental_engineering
Water pollution
Environmental engineering is the contemporary term for sanitary_engineering,
though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the
hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by
environmental engineering. Public health engineering and environmental health
engineering are other terms being used.
Environmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical, biological, or
thermal wastes, purification of water and air, and remediation of contaminated
sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics
covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, water
purification, waste_water_treatment, air pollution, solid_waste_treatment, and
hazardous_waste_management. Environmental engineers administer pollution
reduction, green_engineering, and industrial_ecology. Environmental engineers
also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions.
**** Forensic engineering[edit] ****
Main article: Forensic_engineering
Forensic engineering is the investigation of materials, products, structures or
components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing
personal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt
with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing
processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or
machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it
may be of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic
engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view
to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in
determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of
intellectual property claims, especially patents.
**** Geotechnical engineering[edit] ****
Main article: Geotechnical_engineering
A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water,
and voids.
Geotechnical engineering studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering
systems. Knowledge from the field of soil_science, materials science,
mechanics, and hydraulics is applied to safely and economically design
foundations, retaining_walls, and other structures. Environmental efforts to
protect groundwater and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of
research called geoenvironmental engineering.[22][23]
Identification of soil properties presents challenges to geotechnical
engineers. Boundary_conditions are often well defined in other branches of
civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties and
behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation
on investigation. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear (stress-dependent)
strength, stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application
of shear stress), making studying soil_mechanics all the more difficult.[22]
Geotechnical engineers frequently work with professional geologists and soil
scientists.[24]
**** Materials science and engineering[edit] ****
Main article: Materials_science
Materials science is closely related to civil engineering. It studies
fundamental characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as
concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel,
and thermosetting_polymers including polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and carbon
fibers.
Materials engineering involves protection and prevention (paints and finishes).
Alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired
properties. It incorporates elements of applied_physics and chemistry. With
recent media attention on nanoscience and nanotechnology, materials engineering
has been at the forefront of academic research. It is also an important part of
forensic engineering and failure_analysis.
**** Structural engineering[edit] ****

Shallow_foundation construction example
Structural engineering is concerned with the structural_design and structural
analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off
shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other
structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and
the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads,
and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those
loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live
loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature
change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their
users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be
serviceable). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines
within structural engineering have emerged, including wind_engineering and
earthquake engineering.[25]
Design considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the
structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or
self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or
transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other
considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and
sustainability.
**** Surveying[edit] ****
Main articles: Surveying and Construction_surveying
A student using a dumpy_level
Surveying is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that
occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment such as levels
and theodolites are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation,
horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic
distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning
have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by
survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's
surface in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers,
contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively.
Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other
and to site boundaries and adjacent structures.
Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and
licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying
and mapping, as well as geographic_information_systems. Surveyors also lay out
the routes of railways, tramway_tracks, highways, roads, pipelines and streets
as well as position other infrastructure, such as harbors, before construction.
  Land surveying
In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth
countries land surveying is considered to be a separate and distinct
profession. Land_surveyors are not considered to be engineers, and have their
own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a
licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to
establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and
subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with
boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new
boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as Cadastral
surveying.

  Construction surveying
Construction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians.
Unlike land surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status.
Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:
    * Surveying existing conditions of the future work site, including
      topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground
      infrastructure when possible;
    * "lay-out" or "setting-out": placing reference points and markers that
      will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings;
    * Verifying the location of structures during construction;
    * As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction
      project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the
      specifications set on plans.
**** Transportation engineering[edit] ****
Main article: Transportation_engineering
Transportation engineering is concerned with moving people and goods
efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This
involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation
infrastructure which includes streets, canals, highways, rail_systems,
airports, ports, and mass_transit. It includes areas such as transportation
design, transportation_planning, traffic_engineering, some aspects of urban
engineering, queueing_theory, pavement_engineering, Intelligent_Transportation
System (ITS), and infrastructure management.
**** Municipal or urban engineering[edit] ****

Main article: Urban_engineering
Lake Chapultepec
Municipal engineering is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves
specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, sidewalks, water
supply_networks, sewers, street_lighting, municipal_solid_waste management and
disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and
public works (salt, sand, etc.), public_parks and cycling_infrastructure. In
the case of underground utility networks, it may also include the civil portion
(conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical
and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of waste
collection and bus_service networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with
other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on
the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are
often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.
Municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings,
industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water
supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.)
**** Water resources engineering[edit] ****
See also: Hydraulic_engineering and Hydrology
Hoover_Dam
Water resources engineering is concerned with the collection and management of
water (as a natural_resource). As a discipline it therefore combines elements
of hydrology, environmental science, meteorology, conservation, and resource
management. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and
management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground
(aquifers) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water
resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the
earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or
out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to
other engineers.
Hydraulic engineering is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids,
principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the
design of pipelines, water_supply_network, drainage facilities (including
bridges, dams, channels, culverts, levees, storm_sewers), and canals. Hydraulic
engineers design these facilities using the concepts of fluid_pressure, fluid
statics, fluid_dynamics, and hydraulics, among others.

**** Civil engineering systems[edit] ****
Civil engineering systems is a discipline that promotes the use of systems
thinking to manage complexity and change in civil engineering within its wider
public context. It posits that the proper development of civil engineering
infrastructure requires a holistic, coherent understanding of the relationships
between all of the important factors that contribute to successful projects
while at the same time emphasising the importance of attention to technical
detail. Its purpose is to help integrate the entire civil engineering project
life_cycle from conception, through planning, designing, making, operating to
decommissioning.[26][27]
