Air pollution from a coking_oven.
Air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of substances
including gases, particles, and biological_molecules are introduced into
Earth's_atmosphere. It may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans;
it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food
crops, and may damage the natural or built_environment. Both human activity and
natural processes can generate air pollution.
Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the
world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith_Institute World's
Worst Polluted Places report.[1] According to the 2014 World_Health
Organization report, air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7
million people worldwide,[2] an estimate roughly echoed by one from the
International_Energy_Agency.[3][4]

***** Pollutants *****
Main articles: Pollutant and Greenhouse_gas
An air pollutant is a material in the air that can have adverse effects on
humans and the ecosystem. The substance can be solid particles, liquid
droplets, or gases. A pollutant can be of natural origin or man-made.
Pollutants are classified as primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are
usually produced by processes such as ash from a volcanic eruption. Other
examples include carbon_monoxide gas from motor vehicle exhausts or sulphur
dioxide released from factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly.
Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. Ground
level_ozone is a prominent example of secondary pollutants. Some pollutants may
be both primary and secondary: they are both emitted directly and formed from
other primary pollutants.
Before flue-gas_desulphurization was installed, the emissions from this power
plant in New_Mexico contained excessive amounts of sulphur_dioxide.
Schematic drawing, causes and effects of air pollution: (1) greenhouse effect,
(2) particulate_contamination, (3) increased UV radiation, (4) acid rain, (5)
increased ground-level ozone concentration, (6) increased levels of nitrogen
oxides.
Thermal_oxidisers are air pollution abatement options for hazardous_air
pollutants (HAPs), volatile_organic_compounds (VOCs), and odorous emissions.
Substances emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include:
    * Carbon_dioxide (CO
      2) â Because of its role as a greenhouse_gas it has been described as
      "the leading pollutant"[5] and "the worst climate pollution".[6] Carbon
      dioxide is a natural component of the atmosphere, essential for plant
      life and given off by the human respiratory_system.[7] This question of
      terminology has practical effects, for example as determining whether the
      U.S. Clean_Air_Act is deemed to regulate CO
      2 emissions.[8] CO
      2 currently forms about 410 parts per million (ppm) of earth's
      atmosphere, compared to about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times,[9] and
      billions of metric tons of CO
      2 are emitted annually by burning of fossil_fuels.[10] CO
      2 increase in earth's atmosphere has been accelerating.[11]
    * Sulfur_oxides (SOx) â particularly sulphur dioxide, a chemical compound
      with the formula SO2. SO2 is produced by volcanoes and in various
      industrial processes. Coal and petroleum often contain sulphur compounds,
      and their combustion generates sulphur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO2,
      usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO2, forms H2SO4, and thus
      acid_rain.[2] This is one of the causes for concern over the
      environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.
    * Nitrogen_oxides (NOx) â Nitrogen oxides, particularly nitrogen_dioxide,
      are expelled from high temperature combustion, and are also produced
      during thunderstorms by electric_discharge. They can be seen as a brown
      haze dome above or a plume downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is a
      chemical compound with the formula NO2. It is one of several nitrogen
      oxides. One of the most prominent air pollutants, this reddish-brown
      toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor.
    * Carbon_monoxide (CO) â CO is a colorless, odorless, toxic yet non-
      irritating gas.[12] It is a product of combustion of fuel such as natural
      gas, coal or wood. Vehicular exhaust contributes to the majority of
      carbon monoxide let into our atmosphere. It creates a smog type formation
      in the air that has been linked to many lung diseases and disruptions to
      the natural environment and animals. In 2013, more than half of the
      carbon monoxide emitted into our atmosphere was from vehicle traffic and
      burning one gallon of gas will often emit over 20 pounds of carbon
      monoxide into the air.[13]
    * Volatile_organic_compounds (VOC) â VOCs are a well-known outdoor air
      pollutant. They are categorized as either methane (CH4) or non-methane
      (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which
      contributes to enhanced global_warming. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also
      significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and
      prolonging the life of methane_in_the_atmosphere. This effect varies
      depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and
      xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged
      exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated
      with industrial use.
    * Particulate_matter / particles, alternatively referred to as particulate
      matter (PM), atmospheric particulate matter, or fine particles, are tiny
      particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosol
      refers to combined particles and gas. Some particulates occur naturally,
      originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires,
      living vegetation, and sea spray. Human activities, such as the burning
      of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants and various industrial
      processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged
      worldwide, anthropogenic aerosolsâthose made by human
      activitiesâcurrently account for approximately 10 percent of our
      atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to
      health hazards such as heart disease,[14] altered lung function and lung
      cancer. Particulates are related to respiratory infections and can be
      particularly harmful to those already suffering from conditions like
      asthma.[15]
    * Persistent_free_radicals connected to airborne fine particles are linked
      to cardiopulmonary disease.[16][17]
    * Toxic metals, such as lead and mercury, especially their compounds.
    * Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) â harmful to the ozone_layer; emitted from
      products are currently banned from use. These are gases which are
      released from air conditioners, refrigerators, aerosol sprays, etc. On
      release into the air, CFCs rise to the stratosphere. Here they come in
      contact with other gases and damage the ozone_layer. This allows harmful
      ultraviolet rays to reach the earth's surface. This can lead to skin
      cancer, eye disease and can even cause damage to plants.
    * Ammonia â emitted mainly by agricultural waste. Ammonia is a compound
      with the formula NH3. It is normally encountered as a gas with a
      characteristic pungent odor. Ammonia contributes significantly to the
      nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to
      foodstuffs and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is
      also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals. Although
      in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous. In the atmosphere,
      ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulphur to form secondary
      particles.[18]
    * Odors â such as from garbage, sewage, and industrial processes
    * Radioactive_pollutants â produced by nuclear_explosions, nuclear
      events, war explosives, and natural processes such as the radioactive
      decay of radon.
Secondary pollutants include:
    * Particulates created from gaseous primary pollutants and compounds in
      photochemical smog. Smog is a kind of air pollution. Classic smog results
      from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of
      smoke and sulphur dioxide. Modern smog does not usually come from coal
      but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the
      atmosphere by ultraviolet light from the sun to form secondary pollutants
      that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog.
    * Ground_level_ozone (O3) formed from NOx and VOCs. Ozone (O3) is a key
      constituent of the troposphere. It is also an important constituent of
      certain regions of the stratosphere commonly known as the Ozone layer.
      Photochemical and chemical reactions involving it drive many of the
      chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere by day and by night. At
      abnormally high concentrations brought about by human activities (largely
      the combustion of fossil fuel), it is a pollutant and a constituent of
      smog.
    * Peroxyacetyl_nitrate (C2H3NO5) â similarly formed from NOx and VOCs.
Minor air pollutants include:
    * A large number of minor hazardous_air_pollutants. Some of these are
      regulated in USA under the Clean_Air_Act and in Europe under the Air
      Framework Directive
    * A variety of persistent_organic_pollutants, which can attach to
      particulates
[File:Human Fingerprint on Global Air Quality.webm]Play_media
This video provides an overview of a NASA study on the human fingerprint on
global air quality.
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant
to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic
processes. Because of this, they have been observed to persist in the
environment, to be capable of long-range transport, bioaccumulate in human and
animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and to have potentially significant
impacts on human health and the environment.
**** Sources ****
There are various locations, activities or factors which are responsible for
releasing pollutants into the atmosphere. These sources can be classified into
two major categories.
*** Anthropogenic (man-made) sources ***
Controlled_burning of a field outside of Statesboro, Georgia in preparation for
spring planting.
Smoking of fish over an open fire in Ghana, 2018
These are mostly related to the burning of multiple types of fuel.
    * Stationary sources include smoke stacks of fossil_fuel_power_stations
      (see for example environmental_impact_of_the_coal_industry),
      manufacturing facilities (factories) and waste incinerators, as well as
      furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices. In developing
      and poor countries, traditional biomass burning is the major source of
      air pollutants; traditional biomass includes wood, crop waste and dung.
      [19][20]
    * Mobile sources include motor_vehicles, marine vessels, and aircraft.
    * Controlled_burn practices in agriculture and forest management.
      Controlled or prescribed burning is a technique sometimes used in forest
      management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement.
      Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and
      controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. Controlled burning
      stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing
      the forest.
    * Fumes from paint, hair_spray, varnish, aerosol_sprays and other solvents.
      These can be substantial; emissions from these sources was estimated to
      account for almost half of pollution from volatile_organic_compounds in
      the Los Angeles basin in the 2010s.[21]
    * Waste deposition in landfills, which generate methane. Methane is highly
      flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is also an
      asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia or
      suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below
      19.5% by displacement.
    * Military resources, such as nuclear_weapons, toxic_gases, germ_warfare
      and rocketry.
    * Fertilized farmland may be a major source of nitrogen oxides.[22]
*** Natural sources ***
Dust storm approaching Stratford,_Texas.
    * Dust from natural sources, usually large areas of land with little or no
      vegetation
    * Methane, emitted by the digestion of food by animals, for example cattle
    * Radon gas from radioactive_decay within the Earth's_crust. Radon is a
      colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive noble_gas that is
      formed from the decay of radium. It is considered to be a health hazard.
      Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in
      confined areas such as the basement and it is the second most frequent
      cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking.
    * Smoke and carbon_monoxide from wildfires. During periods of actives
      wildfires, smoke from uncontrolled biomass combustion can make up almost
      75% of all air pollution by concentration.[23]
    * Vegetation, in some regions, emits environmentally significant amounts of
      Volatile_organic_compounds (VOCs) on warmer days. These VOCs react with
      primary anthropogenic pollutantsâspecifically, NOx, SO2, and
      anthropogenic organic carbon compounds â to produce a seasonal haze of
      secondary pollutants.[24] Black gum, poplar, oak and willow are some
      examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs. The VOC production
      from these species result in ozone levels up to eight times higher than
      the low-impact tree species.[25]
    * Volcanic activity, which produces sulphur, chlorine, and ash particulates
**** Emission factors ****
Main article: AP_42_Compilation_of_Air_Pollutant_Emission_Factors
Beijing air on a 2005-day after rain (left) and a smoggy day (right)
Air pollutant emission factors are reported representative values that attempt
to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an
activity associated with the release of that pollutant. These factors are
usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume,
distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms
of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned). Such factors facilitate
estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases,
these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality,
and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.
There are 12 compounds in the list of persistent_organic_pollutants. Dioxins
and furans are two of them and intentionally created by combustion of organics,
like open burning of plastics. These compounds are also endocrine disruptors
and can mutate the human genes.
The United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency has published a compilation
of air pollutant emission factors for a wide range of industrial sources.[26]
The United_Kingdom, Australia, Canada and many other countries have published
similar compilations, as well as the European_Environment_Agency.[27][28][29]
[30]
***** Exposure *****
Up to 30 % of Europeans living in cities are exposed to air pollutant levels
exceeding EU air quality standards. And around 98 % of Europeans living in
cities are exposed to levels of air pollutants deemed damaging to health by the
World Health Organizationâs more stringent guidelines.[31]
Air pollution risk is a function of the hazard of the pollutant and the
exposure to that pollutant. Air pollution exposure can be expressed for an
individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a
country), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the
exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area, which includes the
various microenvironments and age groups. This can be calculated[32] as an
inhalation exposure. This would account for daily exposure in various settings
(e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure
needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially
infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The
exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air
pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective
inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is
in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading,
working, spending time in traffic, etc.). For example, a small child's
inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous
exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary
activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each
micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The
air pollutant concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is
summed to indicate the exposure.[32] For some pollutants such as black_carbon,
traffic related exposures may dominate total exposure despite short exposure
times since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or
participation to (motorized) traffic.[33] A large portion of total daily
exposure occurs as short peaks of high concentrations, but it remains unclear
how to define peaks and determine their frequency and health impact.[34]
***** Indoor air quality (IAQ) *****
Main article: Indoor_air_quality
Air quality monitoring, New_Delhi,_India.
A lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often
spend the majority of their time. Radon (Rn) gas, a carcinogen, is exuded from
the Earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses. Building materials
including carpeting and plywood emit formaldehyde (H2CO) gas. Paint and
solvents give off volatile_organic_compounds (VOCs) as they dry. Lead paint can
degenerate into dust and be inhaled. Intentional air pollution is introduced
with the use of air_fresheners, incense, and other scented items. Controlled
wood fires in stoves and fireplaces can add significant amounts of smoke
particulates into the air, inside and out.[35] Indoor pollution fatalities may
be caused by using pesticides and other chemical sprays indoors without proper
ventilation.
Carbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and
chimneys, or by the burning of charcoal indoors or in a confined space, such as
a tent.[36] Chronic carbon_monoxide_poisoning can result even from poorly-
adjusted pilot_lights. Traps are built into all domestic plumbing to keep sewer
gas and hydrogen_sulfide, out of interiors. Clothing emits tetrachloroethylene,
or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after dry_cleaning.
Though its use has now been banned in many countries, the extensive use of
asbestos in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a
potentially very dangerous material in many localities. Asbestosis is a chronic
inflammatory medical condition affecting the tissue of the lungs. It occurs
after long-term, heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials
in structures. Sufferers have severe dyspnea (shortness of breath) and are at
an increased risk regarding several different types of lung_cancer. As clear
explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature, care should
be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. According
to the World_Health_Organization_(WHO), these may defined as; asbestosis, lung
cancer, and Peritoneal_Mesothelioma (generally a very rare form of cancer, when
more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to
asbestos).
Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors, as gases and
airborne particulates. Pets produce dander, people produce dust from minute
skin flakes and decomposed hair, dust_mites in bedding, carpeting and furniture
produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane,
mold forms on walls and generates mycotoxins and spores, air_conditioning
systems can incubate Legionnaires'_disease and mold, and houseplants, soil and
surrounding gardens can produce pollen, dust, and mold. Indoors, the lack of
air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they
would otherwise occur in nature.
***** Health effects *****
See also: Neuroplastic_effects_of_pollution
In 2012, air pollution caused premature deaths on average of 1 year in Europe,
and was a significant risk_factor for a number of pollution-related_diseases,
including respiratory_infections, heart_disease, COPD, stroke and lung_cancer.
[2] The health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in
breathing, wheezing, coughing, asthma and worsening of existing respiratory and
cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use,
increased doctor or emergency_department visits, more hospital admissions and
premature death. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching,
but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular
system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant
a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health
status and genetics.[32] The most common sources of air pollution include
particulates, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide. Children aged less
than five years that live in developing countries are the most vulnerable
population in terms of total deaths attributable to indoor and outdoor air
pollution.[37]
**** Mortality ****
The World_Health_Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution
causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[2] Studies
published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.
[38]
India has the highest death rate due to air pollution.[39] India also has more
deaths from asthma than any other nation according to the World Health
Organization. In December 2013 air pollution was estimated to kill 500,000
people in China each year.[40] There is a positive correlation between
pneumonia-related deaths and air pollution from motor vehicle emissions.[41]
Annual premature European deaths caused by air pollution are estimated at
430,000[42]-800,000[38] An important cause of these deaths is nitrogen dioxide
and other nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted by road vehicles.[42] In a 2015
consultation document the UK government disclosed that nitrogen dioxide is
responsible for 23,500 premature UK deaths per annum.[43] Across the European
Union, air pollution is estimated to reduce life_expectancy by almost nine
months.[44] Causes of deaths include strokes, heart_disease, COPD, lung cancer,
and lung infections.[2]
Urban outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause 1.3 million deaths worldwide
per year. Children are particularly at risk due to the immaturity of their
respiratory organ systems.[45]
The US_EPA estimated in 2004 that a proposed set of changes in diesel_engine
technology (Tier 2) could result in 12,000 fewer premature mortalities, 15,000
fewer heart_attacks, 6,000 fewer emergency_department visits by children with
asthma, and 8,900 fewer respiratory-related hospital admissions each year in
the United States.[46]
The US EPA has estimated that limiting ground-level ozone concentration to 65
parts per billion, would avert 1,700 to 5,100 premature deaths nationwide in
2020 compared with the 75-ppb standard. The agency projected the more
protective standard would also prevent an additional 26,000 cases of aggravated
asthma, and more than a million cases of missed work or school.[47][48]
Following this assessment, the EPA acted to protect public health by lowering
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone to 70
parts per billion (ppb).[49]
A new economic study of the health impacts and associated costs of air
pollution in the Los_Angeles_Basin and San_Joaquin_Valley of Southern
California shows that more than 3,800 people die prematurely (approximately 14
years earlier than normal) each year because air pollution levels violate
federal standards. The number of annual premature deaths is considerably higher
than the fatalities related to auto collisions in the same area, which average
fewer than 2,000 per year.[50][51][52]
Diesel_exhaust (DE) is a major contributor to combustion-derived particulate
matter air pollution. In several human experimental studies, using a well-
validated exposure chamber setup, DE has been linked to acute vascular
dysfunction and increased thrombus formation.[53][54]
The mechanisms linking air pollution to increased cardiovascular mortality are
uncertain, but probably include pulmonary and systemic inflammation.[55]
**** Cardiovascular disease ****
A 2007 review of evidence found ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor
correlating with increased total mortality from cardiovascular events (range:
12% to 14% per 10 microg/m3 increase).[56]
Air pollution is also emerging as a risk factor for stroke, particularly in
developing countries where pollutant levels are highest.[57] A 2007 study found
that in women, air pollution is not associated with hemorrhagic but with
ischemic stroke.[58] Air pollution was also found to be associated with
increased incidence and mortality from coronary stroke in a cohort study in
2011.[59] Associations are believed to be causal and effects may be mediated by
vasoconstriction, low-grade inflammation and atherosclerosis[60] Other
mechanisms such as autonomic nervous system imbalance have also been suggested.
[61] [62]
**** Lung disease ****
Research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma[63] and COPD[64]
from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Additionally, air
pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from
asthma and COPD.[65][66] Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease (COPD) includes
diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema.[67]
A study conducted in 1960â1961 in the wake of the Great_Smog of 1952 compared
293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and
Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis. All
subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59. Compared to the subjects
from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory
symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function (FEV1
and peak flow rate), and increased sputum production and purulence. The
differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59. The study
controlled for age and smoking habits, so concluded that air pollution was the
most likely cause of the observed differences.[68] More recent studies have
shown that air pollution exposure from traffic reduces lung function
development in children [69] and lung function may be compromised by air
pollution even at low concentrations.[70] Air pollution exposure also cause
lung cancer in non smokers.
It is believed that much like cystic_fibrosis, by living in a more urban
environment serious health hazards become more apparent. Studies have shown
that in urban areas patients suffer mucus hypersecretion, lower levels of lung
function, and more self-diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema.[71]
**** Cancer (lung cancer) ****
Cancer is mainly the result of environmental_factors.[72]
A review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk
factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure
to PM2.5 (fine particulates) increases the overall risk of non-accidental
mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m3 increase. Exposure to PM2.5 was also
associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung_cancer (range: 15% to
21% per 10 microg/m3 increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12%
to 14% per a 10 microg/m3 increase). The review further noted that living close
to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three
outcomes â increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall
non-accidental deaths. The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that
exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart
diseases and exposure to SO2 increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data
was insufficient to provide solid conclusions.[73] Another investigation showed
that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles
in human lung and recommended avoiding heavy activities like running in outdoor
space at polluted areas.[74]
In 2011, a large Danish epidemiological study found an increased risk of lung
cancer for patients who lived in areas with high nitrogen oxide concentrations.
In this study, the association was higher for non-smokers than smokers.[75] An
additional Danish study, also in 2011, likewise noted evidence of possible
associations between air pollution and other forms of cancer, including
cervical cancer and brain cancer.[76]
In December 2015, medical scientists reported that cancer is overwhelmingly a
result of environmental_factors, and not largely down to bad luck.[72]
Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, minimizing alcohol and
eliminating smoking reduces the risk of developing the disease, according to
the researchers.[72]
**** Children ****
In the United States, despite the passage of the Clean_Air_Act in 1970, in 2002
at least 146 million Americans were living in non-attainment_areasâregions in
which the concentration of certain air pollutants exceeded federal standards.
[77] These dangerous pollutants are known as the criteria_pollutants, and
include ozone, particulate_matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon
monoxide, and lead. Protective measures to ensure children's health are being
taken in cities such as New_Delhi, India where buses now use compressed_natural
gas to help eliminate the "pea-soup" smog.[78] A recent study in Europe has
found that exposure to ultrafine particles can increase blood_pressure in
children.[79] According to a WHO report-2018, polluted air is a main cause
poisoning millions of children under the age of 15 years and ruining their
lives which resulting to death of some six hundred thousand children annually.
[80]
*** Infants ***
Ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low
birth weight. A 2014 WHO worldwide survey on maternal and perinatal health
found a statistically significant association between low birth weights (LBW)
and increased levels of exposure to PM2.5. Women in regions with greater than
average PM2.5 levels had statistically significant higher odds of pregnancy
resulting in a low-birth weight infant even when adjusted for country-related
variables.[81] The effect is thought to be from stimulating inflammation and
increasing oxidative stress.
A study by the University of York found that in 2010 exposure to PM2.5 was
strongly associated with 18% of preterm births globally, which was
approximately 2.7 million premature births. The countries with the highest air
pollution associated preterm births were in South and East Asia, the Middle
East, North Africa, and West sub-Saharan Africa.[82]
The source of PM 2.5 differs greatly by region. In South and East Asia,
pregnant women are frequently exposed to indoor air pollution because of the
wood and other biomass fuels used for cooking which are responsible for more
than 80% of regional pollution. In the Middle East, North Africa and West sub-
Saharan Africa, fine PM comes from natural sources, such as dust storms.[82]
The United States had an estimated 50,000 preterm births associated with
exposure to PM2.5 in 2010.[82]
A study performed by Wang, et al. between the years of 1988 and 1991 has found
a correlation between sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and total suspended particulates
(TSP) and preterm births and low birth weights in Beijing. A group of 74,671
pregnant women, in four separate regions of Beijing, were monitored from early
pregnancy to delivery along with daily air pollution levels of sulphur Dioxide
and TSP (along with other particulates). The estimated reduction in birth
weight was 7.3 g for every 100 Âµg/m3 increase in SO2 and 6.9g for each
100 Âµg/m3 increase in TSP. These associations were statistically significant
in both summer and winter, although, summer was greater. The proportion of low
birth weight attributable to air pollution, was 13%. This is the largest
attributable risk ever reported for the known risk factors of low birth weight.
[83] Coal stoves, which are in 97% of homes, are a major source of air
pollution in this area.
Brauer et al. studied the relationship between air pollution and proximity to a
highway with pregnancy outcomes in a Vancouver cohort of pregnant woman using
addresses to estimate exposure during pregnancy. Exposure to NO, NO2, CO PM10
and PM2.5 were associated with infants born small for gestational age (SGA).
Women living <50meters away from an expressway or highway were 26% more likely
to give birth to a SGA infant.[84]
**** "Clean" areas ****
Even in the areas with relatively low levels of air pollution, public health
effects can be significant and costly, since a large number of people breathe
in such pollutants. A study published in 2017 found that even in areas of the
U.S. where ozone and PM2.5 meet federal standards, Medicare recipients who are
exposed to more air pollution have higher mortality rates.[85] A 2005
scientific study for the British Columbia Lung Association showed that a small
improvement in air quality (1% reduction of ambient PM2.5 and ozone
concentrations) would produce $29 million in annual savings in the Metro
Vancouver region in 2010.[86] This finding is based on health valuation of
lethal (death) and sub-lethal (illness) affects.
**** Central nervous system ****
Data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the central
nervous_system.[87]
In a June 2014 study conducted by researchers at the University_of_Rochester
Medical Center, published in the journal Environmental_Health_Perspectives, it
was discovered that early exposure to air pollution causes the same damaging
changes in the brain as autism and schizophrenia. The study also shows that air
pollution also affected short-term_memory, learning ability, and impulsivity.
Lead researcher Professor Deborah Cory-Slechta said that "When we looked
closely at the ventricles, we could see that the white_matter that normally
surrounds them hadn't fully developed. It appears that inflammation had damaged
those brain_cells and prevented that region of the brain from developing, and
the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space. Our findings add to the
growing body of evidence that air pollution may play a role in autism, as well
as in other neurodevelopmental_disorders." Air pollution has a more significant
negative effect on males than on females.[88][89][90]
In 2015, experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic
(situational) cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by
test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality.
Researchers at the Harvard_University and SUNY Upstate Medical University and
Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in
three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in
"conventional" and "green" buildings, as well as green_buildings with enhanced
ventilation. Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used
Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool, which is a well-
validated assessment test for executive decision-making in an unconstrained
situation allowing initiative and improvisation. Significant deficits were
observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of
either volatile_organic_compounds (VOCs) or carbon_dioxide, while keeping other
factors constant. The highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some
classroom or office environments.[91][92] Air pollution increases the risk of
dementia in people over 50 years old.[93]
***** Agricultural effects *****
In India in 2014, it was reported that air pollution by black_carbon and ground
level ozone had reduced crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half
in 2011 when compared to 1980 levels.[94]
***** Economic effects *****
Air pollution costs the world economy $5 trillion per year as a result of
productivity losses and degraded quality of life, according to a joint study by
the World_Bank and the Institute_for_Health_Metrics_and_Evaluation (IHME) at
the University_of_Washington.[95][96][97] These productivity losses are caused
by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution. One out of ten deaths in
2013 was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem is
getting worse. The problem is even more acute in the developing_world.
"Children under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than 60 times as
likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high-income
countries."[95][96] The report states that additional economic losses caused by
air pollution, including health costs[98] and the adverse effect on
agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report, and thus
the actual costs to the world economy are far higher than $5 trillion.
***** Historical disasters *****
The world's worst short-term civilian pollution crisis was the 1984 Bhopal
Disaster in India.[99] Leaked industrial vapours from the Union Carbide
factory, belonging to Union Carbide, Inc., U.S.A. (later bought by Dow_Chemical
Company), killed at least 3787 people and injured from 150,000 to 600,000. The
United Kingdom suffered its worst air pollution event when the December 4 Great
Smog of 1952 formed over London. In six days more than 4,000 died and more
recent estimates put the figure at nearer 12,000.[100] An accidental_leak of
anthrax spores from a biological_warfare laboratory in the former USSR in 1979
near Sverdlovsk is believed to have caused at least 64 deaths.[101] The worst
single incident of air pollution to occur in the US occurred in Donora,
Pennsylvania in late October, 1948, when 20 people died and over 7,000 were
injured.[102]
***** Alternatives to pollution *****
There are now practical alternatives to the principal causes of air pollution:
    * Areas downwind (over 20 miles) of major airports more than double total
      particulate emissions in air, even when factoring in areas with frequent
      ship calls, and heavy freeway and city traffic like Los Angeles.[103]
      Aviation_biofuel mixed in with jetfuel at a 50/50 ratio can reduce jet
      derived cruise altitude particulate emissions by 50-70%, according to a
      NASA led 2017 study (however, this should imply ground level benefits to
      urban air pollution as well).[104]
    * Ship propulsion and idling can be switched to much cleaner fuels like
      natural gas. (Ideally a renewable_source but not practical yet)
    * Combustion of fossil fuels for space heating can be replaced by using
      ground_source_heat_pumps and seasonal_thermal_energy_storage.[105]
    * Electric power generation from burning fossil fuels can be replaced by
      power generation from nuclear and renewables. For poor nations, heating
      and home stoves that contribute much to regional air pollution can be
      replaced by a much cleaner fossil fuel like natural gas, or ideally,
      renewables.
    * Motor vehicles driven by fossil fuels, a key factor in urban air
      pollution, can be replaced by electric vehicles. Though lithium supply
      and cost is a limitation, there are alternatives. Herding more people
      into clean public transit such as electric trains can also help.
      Nevertheless, even in emission-free electric vehicles, rubber tires
      produce significant amounts of air pollution themselves, ranking as 13th
      worst pollutant in Los Angeles.[106]
    * Reducing travel in vehicles can curb pollution. After Stockholm reduced
      vehicle traffic in the central city with a congestion tax, nitrogen
      dioxide and PM10 pollution declined, as did acute pediatric asthma
      attacks.[107]
    * Biodigesters can be utilized in poor nations where slash_and_burn is
      prevalent, turning a useless commodity into a source of income. The
      plants can be gathered and sold to a central authority that will break it
      down in a large modern biodigester, producing much needed energy to use.
    * Induced humidity and ventilation both can greatly dampen air pollution in
      enclosed spaces, which was found to be relatively high inside subway
      lines due to braking and friction and relatively less ironically inside
      transit buses than lower sitting passenger automobiles or subways.[108]
***** Reduction efforts *****
Various air pollution control technologies and strategies are available to
reduce air pollution.[109][110] At its most basic level, land-use_planning is
likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning. In most
developed countries, land-use planning is an important part of social policy,
ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and
population, as well as to protect the environment.
Because a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of fossil_fuels
such as coal and oil, the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution
drastically. Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as wind
power, solar_power, hydro_power which don't cause air pollution.[111] Efforts
to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many
developing countries have permissive regulations),[citation_needed] expanding
regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment,
and small gas-powered equipment such as string_trimmers, chainsaws, and
snowmobiles), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of hybrid
vehicles), conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to electric_vehicles.
Titanium_dioxide has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution.
Ultraviolet light will release free electrons from material, thereby creating
free radicals, which break up VOCs and NOx gases. One form is superhydrophilic.
[112]
In 2014, Prof._Tony_Ryan and Prof._Simon_Armitage of University_of_Sheffield
prepared a 10 meter by 20 meter-sized poster coated with microscopic,
pollution-eating nanoparticles of titanium dioxide. Placed on a building, this
giant poster can absorb the toxic emission from around 20 cars each day.[113]
A very effective means to reduce air pollution is the transition to renewable
energy. According to a study published in Energy_and_Environmental_Science in
2015 the switch to 100%_renewable_energy in the United States would eliminate
about 62,000 premature mortalities per year and about 42,000 in 2050, if no
biomass were used. This would save about $600 billion in health_costs a year
due to reduced air pollution in 2050, or about 3.6% of the 2014 U.S. gross
domestic product.[111]
**** Control devices ****
The following items are commonly used as pollution control devices in industry
and transportation. They can either destroy contaminants or remove them from an
exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere.
    * Particulate control
          o Mechanical collectors (dust_cyclones, multicyclones)
          o Electrostatic_precipitators An electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or
            electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that
            removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air), using the force
            of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are
            highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow
            of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine
            particulates such as dust and smoke from the air stream.
          o Baghouses Designed to handle heavy dust loads, a dust collector
            consists of a blower, dust filter, a filter-cleaning system, and a
            dust receptacle or dust removal system (distinguished from air
            cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust).
          o Particulate_scrubbers Wet scrubber is a form of pollution control
            technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use
            pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a
            wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with
            the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it
            through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to
            remove the pollutants.
    * Scrubbers
          o Baffle_spray_scrubber
          o Cyclonic_spray_scrubber
          o Ejector_venturi_scrubber
          o Mechanically_aided_scrubber
          o Spray_tower
          o Wet_scrubber
    * NOx_control
          o Low_NOx_burners
          o Selective_catalytic_reduction (SCR)
          o Selective_non-catalytic_reduction (SNCR)
          o NOx_scrubbers
          o Exhaust_gas_recirculation
          o Catalytic_converter (also for VOC control)
    * VOC_abatement
          o Adsorption_systems, using activated_carbon, such as Fluidized_Bed
            Concentrator
          o Flares
          o Thermal_oxidizers
          o Catalytic_converters
          o Biofilters
          o Absorption_(scrubbing)
          o Cryogenic condensers
          o Vapor_recovery_systems
    * Acid_Gas/SO2 control
          o Wet_scrubbers
          o Dry_scrubbers
          o Flue-gas_desulphurization
    * Mercury control
          o Sorbent Injection Technology
          o Electro-Catalytic Oxidation (ECO)
          o K-Fuel
    * Dioxin and furan control
    * Miscellaneous associated equipment
          o Source capturing systems
          o Continuous_emissions_monitoring_systems (CEMS)
***** Regulations *****
Smog in Cairo
Main article: Air_quality_law
In general, there are two types of air quality standards. The first class of
standards (such as the U.S. National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards and E.U. Air
Quality_Directive) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific
pollutants. Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to
result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the
North American air_quality_index) take the form of a scale with various
thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of
outdoor activity. The scale may or may not distinguish between different
pollutants.
**** Canada ****
In Canada, air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the Air
Quality_Health_Index or (AQHI). It is a health protection tool used to make
decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity
levels during increased levels of air pollution.
The Air Quality Health Index or "AQHI" is a federal program jointly coordinated
by Health_Canada and Environment_Canada. However, the AQHI program would not be
possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities
and NGOs. From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and
community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of
work related to AQHI implementation. The AQHI provides a number from 1 to 10+
to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality.
Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number
may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a
local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight and tomorrow and
provides associated health advice.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 +
Risk: Low (1-âModerate (4-âHigh (7-â1Very high (above 10)
As it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort
for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The
higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions.
The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as
'low', 'moderate', 'high' or 'very high', and suggests steps that can be taken
to reduce exposure.[114]

The measurement is based on the observed relationship of Nitrogen Dioxide
(NO2), ground-level Ozone (O3) and particulates (PM2.5) with mortality, from an
analysis of several Canadian cities. Significantly, all three of these
pollutants can pose health risks, even at low levels of exposure, especially
among those with pre-existing health problems.
When developing the AQHI, Health Canada's original analysis of health effects
included five major air pollutants: particulates, ozone, and nitrogen_dioxide
(NO2), as well as sulphur_dioxide (SO2), and carbon_monoxide (CO). The latter
two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and
were removed from the AQHI formulation.
The AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, pollen, dust, heat or humidity.

***** Hotspots *****
Main article: Toxic_Hotspots
Air pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose
individuals to increased negative health effects.[116] They are particularly
common in highly populated, urban areas, where there may be a combination of
stationary sources (e.g. industrial facilities) and mobile sources (e.g. cars
and trucks) of pollution. Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory
disease, childhood asthma, cancer, and other health problems. Fine particulate
matter such as diesel soot, which contributes to more than 3.2 million
premature deaths around the world each year, is a significant problem. It is
very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream.
Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas, and one in six people
in the U.S. live near a diesel pollution hot spot.[117]
                             External video
 AirVisual_Earth â realtime map of global wind and air pollution [118]
While air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations, some groups are
more likely to be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities
in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic
storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend
to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low
socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social_vulnerability,
including race, a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability
to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities
bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely
to face health risks such as cancer or asthma.[119]
Studies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a
higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes.
[120] Communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial
minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts
resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged
communities.[120] Blacks and Latinos generally face more pollution than whites
and Asians, and low-income communities bear a higher burden of risk than
affluent ones.[119] Racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban
areas of the US South and metropolitan areas of the US West.[121][clarification
needed] Residents in public housing, who are generally low-income and cannot
move to healthier neighborhoods, are highly affected by nearby refineries and
chemical plants.[122]

Deaths from air pollution in 2004
Air pollution is usually concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas,
especially in developing countries where environmental regulations are
relatively lax or nonexistent.[123] However, even populated areas in developed
countries attain unhealthy levels of pollution, with Los_Angeles and Rome being
two examples.[124] Between 2002 and 2011 the incidence of lung cancer in
Beijing near doubled. While smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer in
China, the number of smokers is falling while lung cancer rates are rising.

***** Governing urban air pollution *****
In Europe, Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and
management provides a common strategy against which member_states can "set
objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful
effects on human health and the environment ... and improve air quality where
it is unsatisfactory".[127]
On 25 July 2008 in the case Dieter Janecek v Freistaat Bayern CURIA, the
European_Court_of_Justice ruled that under this directive[127] citizens have
the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan
that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values.[128]
This important case_law appears to confirm the role of the EC as centralised
regulator to European nation-states as regards air pollution control. It places
a supranational legal obligation on the UK to protect its citizens from
dangerous levels of air pollution, furthermore superseding national interests
with those of the citizen.
In 2010, the European_Commission (EC) threatened the UK with legal action
against the successive breaching of PM10 limit values.[129] The UK government
has identified that if fines are imposed, they could cost the nation upwards of
Â£300 million per year.[130]
In March 2011, the Greater_London_Built-up_Area remains the only UK region in
breach of the EC's limit values, and has been given 3 months to implement an
emergency action plan aimed at meeting the EU Air Quality Directive.[131] The
City of London has dangerous levels of PM10 concentrations, estimated to cause
3000 deaths per year within the city.[132] As well as the threat of EU fines,
in 2010 it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western
congestion_charge zone, which is claimed to have led to an increase in air
pollution levels.[133]
In response to these charges, Boris_Johnson, Mayor_of_London, has criticised
the current need for European cities to communicate with Europe through their
nation state's central_government, arguing that in future "A great city like
London" should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the
European Commission regarding its air quality action plan.[131]
This can be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the
traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions
to air pollution using global governance networks, for example through
transnational relations. Transnational relations include but are not exclusive
to national governments and intergovernmental organisations,[134] allowing sub-
national actors including cities and regions to partake in air pollution
control as independent actors.
Particularly promising at present are global city partnerships.[135] These can
be built into networks, for example the C40_Cities_Climate_Leadership_Group, of
which London is a member. The C40 is a public 'non-state' network of the
world's leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions.[135] The
C40 has been identified as 'governance from the middle' and is an alternative
to intergovernmental policy.[136] It has the potential to improve urban air
quality as participating cities "exchange information, learn from best
practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from
national government decisions".[135] A criticism of the C40 network is that its
exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing
resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.
