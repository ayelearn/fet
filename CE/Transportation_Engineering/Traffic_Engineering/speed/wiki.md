Speed
[Mersan.JPG]
Speed can be thought of as the rate at which an object covers distance. A
fast-moving object has a high speed and covers a relatively large distance in
a given amount of time, while a slow-moving object covers a relatively small
amount of distance in the same amount of time.

In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed of an object is the magnitude of
its velocity (the rate_of_change of its position); it is thus a scalar
quantity.[1] The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the
distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval;[2]
the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of
the time interval approaches zero.
Speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The SI_unit of speed is
the metre_per_second, but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is
the kilometre_per_hour or, in the US and the UK, miles_per_hour. For air and
marine travel the knot is commonly used.
The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according
to special_relativity, is the speed_of_light in a vacuum c = 299792458 metres
per second (approximately 1079000000 km/h or 671000000 mph). Matter cannot
quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of
energy. In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical
idea of speed.

***** Definition[edit] *****
**** Historical definition[edit] ****
Italian physicist Galileo_Galilei is usually credited with being the first to
measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes.
Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time.[3] In equation
form, that is
         v =   d t   ,   {\displaystyle v={\frac {d}{t}},}  [v={\frac  {d}
      {t}},]
where     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] is speed,     d   {\displaystyle d}  [d]
is distance, and     t   {\displaystyle t}  [t] is time. A cyclist who covers
30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per
second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel
along a street at 50 km/h, slow to 0 km/h, and then reach 30 km/h).
**** Instantaneous speed[edit] ****
Speed at some instant, or assumed constant during a very_short period of time,
is called instantaneous speed. By looking at a speedometer, one can read the
instantaneous speed of a car at any instant.[3] A car travelling at 50 km/
h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go
at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50 km. If the vehicle continued
at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25 km). If
it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833 m.
In mathematical terms, the instantaneous speed     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v]
is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity      v
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}}  [{\boldsymbol {v}}], that is, the derivative
of the position      r    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}}  [{\boldsymbol
{r}}] with respect to time:[2][4]
         v =  |  v  |  =  |    r &#x02D9;    |  =  |    d  r    d t    |   .
      {\displaystyle v=\left|{\boldsymbol {v}}\right|=\left|{\dot {\boldsymbol
      {r}}}\right|=\left|{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {r}}}{dt}}\right|\,.}  [v=\left|
      {\boldsymbol  v}\right|=\left|{\dot  {{\boldsymbol  r}}}\right|=\left|
      {\frac  {d{\boldsymbol  r}}{dt}}\right|\,.]
If     s   {\displaystyle s}  [s] is the length of the path (also known as the
distance) travelled until time     t   {\displaystyle t}  [t], the speed equals
the time derivative of     s   {\displaystyle s}  [s]:[2]
         v =    d s   d t    .   {\displaystyle v={\frac {ds}{dt}}.}  [v={\frac
      {ds}{dt}}.]
In the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in
a straight line), this can be simplified to     v = s  /  t   {\displaystyle
v=s/t}  [v=s/t]. The average speed over a finite time interval is the total
distance travelled divided by the time duration.
**** Average speed[edit] ****
Different from instantaneous speed, average speed is defined as the total
distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80
kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour.
Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also
80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time
in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h).
Average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place
during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by
the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a
value of instantaneous speed.[3] If the average speed and the time of travel
are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the
definition to
         d =    v &#x00AF;    t  .   {\displaystyle d={\boldsymbol {\bar
      {v}}}t\,.}  [d={\boldsymbol  {{\bar  {v}}}}t\,.]
Using this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour
trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres.
Expressed in graphical language, the slope of a tangent_line at any point of a
distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope
of a chord_line of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval
covered by the chord. Average speed of an object is Vav = sÃ·t
**** Difference between speed and velocity[edit] ****
Speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes
both how fast and in which direction the object is moving.[5] If a car is said
to travel at 60 km/h, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said
to move at 60 km/h to the north, its velocity has now been specified.
The big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle.
When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its
average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the
circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This
is because the average velocity is calculated by considering only the
displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average speed
considers only the total distance traveled.
**** Tangential speed[edit] ****

Linear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time, while tangential speed
(or tangential velocity) is the linear speed of something moving along a
circular path.[6] A point on the outside edge of a merry-go-round or turntable
travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the
center. Travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed,
and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it
is closer to the axis. This speed along a circular path is known as tangential
speed because the direction of motion is tangent to the circumference of the
circle. For circular motion, the terms linear speed and tangential speed are
used interchangeably, and both use units of m/s, km/h, and others.
Rotational_speed (or angular speed) involves the number of revolutions per unit
of time. All parts of a rigid merry-go-round or turntable turn about the axis
of rotation in the same amount of time. Thus, all parts share the same rate of
rotation, or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time. It
is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute (RPM) or in
terms of the number of "radians" turned in a unit of time. There are little
more than 6 radians in a full rotation (2Ï radians exactly). When a direction
is assigned to rotational speed, it is known as rotational velocity or angular
velocity. Rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational
speed.
Tangential speed and rotational speed are related: the greater the RPMs, the
larger the speed in metres per second. Tangential speed is directly
proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of
rotation.[6] However, tangential speed, unlike rotational speed, depends on
radial distance (the distance from the axis). For a platform rotating with a
fixed rotational speed, the tangential speed in the centre is zero. Towards the
edge of the platform the tangential speed increases proportional to the
distance from the axis.[7] In equation form:
         v &#x221D;   r &#x03C9;  ,   {\displaystyle v\propto \!\,r\omega \,,}
      [v\propto \!\,r\omega \,,]
where v is tangential speed and Ï (Greek letter omega) is rotational speed.
One moves faster if the rate of rotation increases (a larger value for Ï), and
one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs (a larger value
for r). Move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move
twice as fast. Move out three times as far and you have three times as much
tangential speed. In any kind of rotating system, tangential speed depends on
how far you are from the axis of rotation.
When proper units are used for tangential speed v, rotational speed Ï, and
radial distance r, the direct proportion of v to both r and Ï becomes the
exact equation
         v = r &#x03C9;  .   {\displaystyle v=r\omega \,.}  [v=r\omega \,.]
Thus, tangential speed will be directly proportional to r when all parts of a
system simultaneously have the same Ï, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand.

***** Psychology[edit] *****
According to Jean_Piaget, the intuition for the notion of speed in humans
precedes that of duration, and is based on the notion of outdistancing.[11]
Piaget studied this subject inspired by a question asked to him in 1928 by
Albert_Einstein: "In what order do children acquire the concepts of time and
speed?"[12] Children's early concept of speed is based on "overtaking", taking
only temporal and spatial orders into consideration, specifically: "A moving
object is judged to be more rapid than another when at a given moment the first
object is behind and a moment or so later ahead of the other object."[13]
