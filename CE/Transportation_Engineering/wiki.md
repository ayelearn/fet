Transportation engineering or transport engineering is the application of
technology and scientific_principles to the planning, functional design,
operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order
to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical,
and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods transport.
The planning aspects of transportation engineering relate to elements of urban
planning, and involve technical forecasting decisions and political factors.
Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban
transportation planning model, requiring the estimation of trip_generation
(number of purposeful trips), trip_distribution (destination choice, where the
traveler is going), mode_choice (mode that is being taken), and route
assignment (the streets or routes that are being used). More sophisticated
forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions, including auto
ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a
tour) and the choice of residential or business location (known as land_use
forecasting). Passenger trips are the focus of transportation engineering
because they often represent the peak of demand on any transportation system.
A review of descriptions of the scope of various committees indicates that
while facility planning and design continue to be the core of the
transportation engineering field, such areas as operations planning, logistics,
network analysis, financing, and policy analysis are also important,
particularly to those working in highway and urban transportation. The National
Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) list online the
safety protocols, geometric design requirements, and signal timing.
Transportation engineering, primarily involves planning, design, construction,
maintenance, and operation of transportation facilities. The facilities support
air, highway, railroad, pipeline, water, and even space transportation. The
design aspects of transportation engineering include the sizing of
transportation facilities (how many lanes or how much capacity the facility
has), determining the materials and thickness used in pavement designing the
geometry (vertical and horizontal alignment) of the roadway (or track).
Before any planning occurs an engineer must take what is known as an inventory
of the area or, if it is appropriate, the previous system in place. This
inventory or database must include information on population, land use,
economic activity, transportation facilities and services, travel patterns and
volumes, laws and ordinances, regional financial resources, and community
values and expectations. These inventories help the engineer create business
models to complete accurate forecasts of the future conditions of the system.
Operations and management involve traffic_engineering, so that vehicles move
smoothly on the road or track. Older techniques include signs, signals,
markings, and tolling. Newer technologies involve intelligent_transportation
systems, including advanced traveler information systems (such as variable
message_signs), advanced traffic control systems (such as ramp_meters), and
vehicle_infrastructure_integration. Human_factors are an aspect of
transportation engineering, particularly concerning driver-vehicle interface
and user interface of road signs, signals, and markings.

***** Highway engineering[edit] *****
Main article: Highway_engineering
Engineers in this specialization:
    * Handle the planning, design, construction, and operation of highways,
      roads, and other vehicular facilities as well as their related bicycle
      and pedestrian realms
    * Estimate the transportation needs of the public and then secure the
      funding for projects
    * Analyze locations of high traffic volumes and high collisions for safety
      and capacity
    * Use engineering principles to improve the transportation system
    * Utilize the three design controls, which are the drivers, the vehicles,
      and the roadways themselves
***** Railroad engineering[edit] *****
Main article: Railway_systems_engineering
Railway engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of railroads
and mass transit systems that use a fixed guideway (such as light_rail or
monorails). Typical tasks include determining horizontal and vertical alignment
design, station location and design, and construction cost estimating. Railroad
engineers can also move into the specialized field of train dispatching which
focuses on train movement control.
Railway engineers also work to build a cleaner and safer transportation network
by reinvesting and revitalizing the rail system to meet future demands. In the
United States, railway engineers work with elected officials in Washington,
D.C. on rail transportation issues to make sure that the rail system meets the
country's transportation needs.[1]
***** Port and harbor engineering[edit] *****
Not to be confused with Naval_architecture or marine_engineering.
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (November
         2018)
Port and harbor engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of
ports, harbors, canals, and other maritime facilities.
***** Airport engineering[edit] *****

Airport engineers design and construct airports. Airport engineers must account
for the impacts and demands of aircraft in their design of airport facilities.
These engineers must use the analysis of predominant wind direction to
determine runway orientation, determine the size of runway border and safety
areas, different wing tip to wing tip clearances for all gates and must
designate the clear zones in the entire port.
