Graphs like this are among the objects studied by discrete mathematics, for
their interesting mathematical_properties, their usefulness as models of real-
world problems, and their importance in developing computer algorithms.
Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical_structures that are
fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real_numbers that
have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete
mathematics â such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic[1] â do not
vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.[2][3] Discrete
mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as
calculus or Euclidean_geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by
integers. More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the
branch of mathematics dealing with countable_sets[4] (finite sets or sets with
the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact
definition of the term "discrete mathematics."[5] Indeed, discrete mathematics
is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously
varying quantities and related notions.
The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite.
The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of
discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas
relevant to business.
Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth
century partly due to the development of digital_computers which operate in
discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from
discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems
in branches of computer_science, such as computer_algorithms, programming
languages, cryptography, automated_theorem_proving, and software_development.
Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from
discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations_research.
Although the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete
objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as
well.
In university curricula, "Discrete Mathematics" appeared in the 1980s,
initially as a computer science support course; its contents were somewhat
haphazard at the time. The curriculum has thereafter developed in conjunction
with efforts by ACM and MAA into a course that is basically intended to develop
mathematical_maturity in first-year students; therefore it is nowadays a
prerequisite for mathematics majors in some universities as well.[6][7] Some
high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well.[8] At
this level, discrete mathematics is sometimes seen as a preparatory course, not
unlike precalculus in this respect.[9]
The Fulkerson_Prize is awarded for outstanding papers in discrete mathematics.

***** Grand challenges, past and present[edit] *****
Much research in graph_theory was motivated by attempts to prove that all maps,
like this one, can be colored using only_four_colors so that no areas of the
same color share an edge. Kenneth_Appel and Wolfgang_Haken proved this in 1976.
[10]
The history of discrete mathematics has involved a number of challenging
problems which have focused attention within areas of the field. In graph
theory, much research was motivated by attempts to prove the four_color
theorem, first stated in 1852, but not proved until 1976 (by Kenneth Appel and
Wolfgang Haken, using substantial computer assistance).[10]
In logic, the second_problem on David_Hilbert's list of open problems presented
in 1900 was to prove that the axioms of arithmetic are consistent. GÃ¶del's
second_incompleteness_theorem, proved in 1931, showed that this was not
possible â at least not within arithmetic itself. Hilbert's_tenth_problem was
to determine whether a given polynomial Diophantine_equation with integer
coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, Yuri_Matiyasevich proved that
this could_not_be_done.
The need to break German codes in World_War_II led to advances in cryptography
and theoretical_computer_science, with the first_programmable_digital
electronic_computer being developed at England's Bletchley_Park with the
guidance of Alan_Turing and his seminal work, On Computable Numbers.[11] At the
same time, military requirements motivated advances in operations_research. The
Cold_War meant that cryptography remained important, with fundamental advances
such as public-key_cryptography being developed in the following decades.
Operations research remained important as a tool in business and project
management, with the critical_path_method being developed in the 1950s. The
telecommunication industry has also motivated advances in discrete mathematics,
particularly in graph theory and information_theory. Formal_verification of
statements in logic has been necessary for software_development of safety-
critical_systems, and advances in automated_theorem_proving have been driven by
this need.
Computational_geometry has been an important part of the computer_graphics
incorporated into modern video_games and computer-aided_design tools.
Several fields of discrete mathematics, particularly theoretical computer
science, graph theory, and combinatorics, are important in addressing the
challenging bioinformatics problems associated with understanding the tree_of
life.[12]
Currently, one of the most famous open problems in theoretical computer science
is the P_=_NP_problem, which involves the relationship between the complexity
classes P and NP. The Clay_Mathematics_Institute has offered a $1 million USD
prize for the first correct proof, along with prizes for six_other_mathematical
problems.[13]
***** Topics in discrete mathematics[edit] *****
**** Theoretical computer science[edit] ****
Main article: Theoretical_computer_science
Complexity studies the time taken by algorithms, such as this sorting_routine.
Theoretical computer science includes areas of discrete mathematics relevant to
computing. It draws heavily on graph_theory and mathematical_logic. Included
within theoretical computer science is the study of algorithms for computing
mathematical results. Computability studies what can be computed in principle,
and has close ties to logic, while complexity studies the time, space, and
other resources taken by computations. Automata_theory and formal_language
theory are closely related to computability. Petri_nets and process_algebras
are used to model computer systems, and methods from discrete mathematics are
used in analyzing VLSI electronic circuits. Computational_geometry applies
algorithms to geometrical problems, while computer_image_analysis applies them
to representations of images. Theoretical computer science also includes the
study of various continuous computational topics.
**** Information theory[edit] ****
Main article: Information_theory
The ASCII codes for the word "Wikipedia", given here in binary, provide a way
of representing the word in information_theory, as well as for information-
processing algorithms.
Information theory involves the quantification of information. Closely related
is coding_theory which is used to design efficient and reliable data
transmission and storage methods. Information theory also includes continuous
topics such as: analog_signals, analog_coding, analog_encryption.
**** Logic[edit] ****
Main article: Mathematical_logic
Logic is the study of the principles of valid reasoning and inference, as well
as of consistency, soundness, and completeness. For example, in most systems of
logic (but not in intuitionistic_logic) Peirce's_law (((PâQ)âP)âP) is a
theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a truth_table. The
study of mathematical_proof is particularly important in logic, and has
applications to automated_theorem_proving and formal_verification of software.
Logical_formulas are discrete structures, as are proofs, which form finite
trees[14] or, more generally, directed_acyclic_graph structures[15][16] (with
each inference_step combining one or more premise branches to give a single
conclusion). The truth_values of logical formulas usually form a finite set,
generally restricted to two values: true and false, but logic can also be
continuous-valued, e.g., fuzzy_logic. Concepts such as infinite proof trees or
infinite derivation trees have also been studied,[17] e.g. infinitary_logic.
**** Set theory[edit] ****
Main article: Set_theory
Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets, which are
collections of objects, such as {blue, white, red} or the (infinite) set of all
prime_numbers. Partially_ordered_sets and sets with other relations have
applications in several areas.
In discrete mathematics, countable_sets (including finite_sets) are the main
focus. The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is usually marked
by Georg_Cantor's work distinguishing between different kinds of infinite_set,
motivated by the study of trigonometric series, and further development of the
theory of infinite sets is outside the scope of discrete mathematics. Indeed,
contemporary work in descriptive_set_theory makes extensive use of traditional
continuous mathematics.
**** Combinatorics[edit] ****
Main article: Combinatorics
Combinatorics studies the way in which discrete structures can be combined or
arranged. Enumerative_combinatorics concentrates on counting the number of
certain combinatorial objects - e.g. the twelvefold_way provides a unified
framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions. Analytic
combinatorics concerns the enumeration (i.e., determining the number) of
combinatorial structures using tools from complex_analysis and probability
theory. In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit
combinatorial formulae and generating_functions to describe the results,
analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining asymptotic_formulae. Design theory is
a study of combinatorial_designs, which are collections of subsets with certain
intersection properties. Partition_theory studies various enumeration and
asymptotic problems related to integer_partitions, and is closely related to q-
series, special_functions and orthogonal_polynomials. Originally a part of
number_theory and analysis, partition theory is now considered a part of
combinatorics or an independent field. Order_theory is the study of partially
ordered_sets, both finite and infinite.
**** Graph theory[edit] ****
Main article: Graph_theory
Graph_theory has close links to group_theory. This truncated_tetrahedron graph
is related to the alternating_group A4.
Graph theory, the study of graphs and networks, is often considered part of
combinatorics, but has grown large enough and distinct enough, with its own
kind of problems, to be regarded as a subject in its own right.[18] Graphs are
one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the
most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can
model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and
social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of
communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of
computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts
of topology, e.g. knot_theory. Algebraic_graph_theory has close links with
group theory. There are also continuous_graphs, however for the most part
research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.
**** Probability[edit] ****
Main article: Discrete_probability_theory
Discrete probability theory deals with events that occur in countable sample
spaces. For example, count observations such as the numbers of birds in flocks
comprise only natural number values {0, 1, 2, ...}. On the other hand,
continuous observations such as the weights of birds comprise real number
values and would typically be modeled by a continuous probability distribution
such as the normal. Discrete probability distributions can be used to
approximate continuous ones and vice versa. For highly constrained situations
such as throwing dice or experiments with decks_of_cards, calculating the
probability of events is basically enumerative_combinatorics.
**** Number theory[edit] ****
The Ulam_spiral of numbers, with black pixels showing prime_numbers. This
diagram hints at patterns in the distribution of prime numbers.
Main article: Number_theory
Number theory is concerned with the properties of numbers in general,
particularly integers. It has applications to cryptography and cryptanalysis,
particularly with regard to modular_arithmetic, diophantine_equations, linear
and quadratic congruences, prime numbers and primality_testing. Other discrete
aspects of number theory include geometry_of_numbers. In analytic_number
theory, techniques from continuous mathematics are also used. Topics that go
beyond discrete objects include transcendental_numbers, diophantine
approximation, p-adic_analysis and function_fields.
**** Algebra[edit] ****
Main article: Abstract_algebra
Algebraic_structures occur as both discrete examples and continuous examples.
Discrete algebras include: boolean_algebra used in logic_gates and programming;
relational_algebra used in databases; discrete and finite versions of groups,
rings and fields are important in algebraic_coding_theory; discrete semigroups
and monoids appear in the theory of formal_languages.
**** Calculus of finite differences, discrete calculus or discrete analysis
[edit] ****
Main article: Finite_difference
A function defined on an interval of the integers is usually called a sequence.
A sequence could be a finite sequence from a data source or an infinite
sequence from a discrete_dynamical_system. Such a discrete function could be
defined explicitly by a list (if its domain is finite), or by a formula for its
general term, or it could be given implicitly by a recurrence_relation or
difference_equation. Difference equations are similar to a differential
equations, but replace differentiation by taking the difference between
adjacent terms; they can be used to approximate differential equations or (more
often) studied in their own right. Many questions and methods concerning
differential equations have counterparts for difference equations. For
instance, where there are integral_transforms in harmonic_analysis for studying
continuous functions or analogue signals, there are discrete_transforms for
discrete functions or digital signals. As well as the discrete_metric there are
more general discrete or finite_metric_spaces and finite_topological_spaces.
**** Geometry[edit] ****
Computational_geometry applies computer algorithms to representations of
geometrical objects.
Main articles: Discrete_geometry and Computational_geometry
Discrete_geometry and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties
of discrete collections of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in
discrete geometry is tiling_of_the_plane. Computational geometry applies
algorithms to geometrical problems.
**** Topology[edit] ****
Although topology is the field of mathematics that formalizes and generalizes
the intuitive notion of "continuous deformation" of objects, it gives rise to
many discrete topics; this can be attributed in part to the focus on
topological_invariants, which themselves usually take discrete values. See
combinatorial_topology, topological_graph_theory, topological_combinatorics,
computational_topology, discrete_topological_space, finite_topological_space,
topology_(chemistry).
**** Operations research[edit] ****
Main article: Operations_research
PERT charts like this provide a project management technique based on graph
theory.
Operations research provides techniques for solving practical problems in
engineering, business, and other fields â problems such as allocating
resources to maximize profit, or scheduling project activities to minimize
risk. Operations research techniques include linear_programming and other areas
of optimization, queuing_theory, scheduling_theory, network_theory. Operations
research also includes continuous topics such as continuous-time_Markov
process, continuous-time martingales, process_optimization, and continuous and
hybrid control_theory.
**** Game theory, decision theory, utility theory, social choice theory[edit]
****
             Cooperate  Defect
   Cooperate â1, ââ10, 0
   Defect    0, â10â5, â5
   Payoff matrix for the Prisoner's_dilemma, a common example in game_theory.
   One player chooses a row, the other a column; the resulting pair gives their
   payoffs
Decision_theory is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and
other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting
optimal decision.
Utility_theory is about measures of the relative economic satisfaction from, or
desirability of, consumption of various goods and services.
Social_choice_theory is about voting. A more puzzle-based approach to voting is
ballot_theory.
Game_theory deals with situations where success depends on the choices of
others, which makes choosing the best course of action more complex. There are
even continuous games, see differential_game. Topics include auction_theory and
fair_division.
**** Discretization[edit] ****
Main article: Discretization
Discretization concerns the process of transferring continuous models and
equations into discrete counterparts, often for the purposes of making
calculations easier by using approximations. Numerical_analysis provides an
important example.
**** Discrete analogues of continuous mathematics[edit] ****
There are many concepts in continuous mathematics which have discrete versions,
such as discrete_calculus, discrete_probability_distributions, discrete_Fourier
transforms, discrete_geometry, discrete_logarithms, discrete_differential
geometry, discrete_exterior_calculus, discrete_Morse_theory, difference
equations, discrete_dynamical_systems, and discrete_vector measures.
In applied_mathematics, discrete_modelling is the discrete analogue of
continuous_modelling. In discrete modelling, discrete formulae are fit to data.
A common method in this form of modelling is to use recurrence_relation.
In algebraic_geometry, the concept of a curve can be extended to discrete
geometries by taking the spectra of polynomial_rings over finite_fields to be
models of the affine_spaces over that field, and letting subvarieties or
spectra of other rings provide the curves that lie in that space. Although the
space in which the curves appear has a finite number of points, the curves are
not so much sets of points as analogues of curves in continuous settings. For
example, every point of the form     V ( x &#x2212; c ) &#x2282; Spec &#x2061;
K [ x ] =   A   1     {\displaystyle V(x-c)\subset \operatorname {Spec} K
[x]=\mathbb {A} ^{1}}  [V(x-c)\subset \operatorname {Spec} K[x]=\mathbb {A} ^
{1}] for     K   {\displaystyle K}  [K] a field can be studied either as
Spec &#x2061; K [ x ]  /  ( x &#x2212; c ) &#x2245; Spec &#x2061; K
{\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} K[x]/(x-c)\cong \operatorname {Spec} K}
[\operatorname {Spec} K[x]/(x-c)\cong \operatorname {Spec} K], a point, or as
the spectrum     Spec &#x2061; K [ x  ]  ( x &#x2212; c )     {\displaystyle
\operatorname {Spec} K[x]_{(x-c)}}  [\operatorname {Spec} K[x]_{(x-c)}] of the
local_ring_at_(x-c), a point together with a neighborhood around it. Algebraic
varieties also have a well-defined notion of tangent_space called the Zariski
tangent_space, making many features of calculus applicable even in finite
settings.
**** Hybrid discrete and continuous mathematics[edit] ****
The time_scale_calculus is a unification of the theory of difference_equations
with that of differential_equations, which has applications to fields requiring
simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. Another way of modeling
such a situation is the notion of hybrid_dynamical_system.
