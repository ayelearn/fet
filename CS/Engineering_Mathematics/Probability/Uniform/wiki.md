For other uses, see Uniform_(disambiguation).
A variety of uniforms used in the Canadian_Militia, 1898.
A uniform is a type of clothing worn by members of an organization while
participating in that organization's activity. Modern uniforms are most often
worn by armed_forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency
services, security_guards, in some workplaces and schools and by inmates in
prisons. In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their
duties; such is the case of the Commissioned_Corps of the United_States_Public
Health_Service or the French prefects. For some organizations, such as police,
it may be illegal for non members to wear the uniform.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
From the Latin unus, one, and forma, form.[1]
***** Service and work uniforms[edit] *****
Uniformed newspaper vendors in Mexico_City. Some work places require their
employees to wear a uniform.
Workers sometimes wear uniforms or corporate clothing of one nature or another.
Workers required to wear a uniform include retail workers, bank and post_office
workers, public_security and health_care workers, blue_collar employees,
personal_trainers in health clubs, instructors in summer_camps, lifeguards,
janitors, public_transit employees, towing and truck drivers, airline employees
and holiday operators, and bar, restaurant and hotel employees. The use of
uniforms by these organizations is often an effort in branding and developing a
standard corporate_image but also has important effects on the employees
required to wear the uniform.
The term uniform may be misleading because employees are not always fully
uniform in appearance and may not always wear attire provided by the
organization, while still representing the organization in their attire.
Academic work on organizational dress by Rafaeli & Pratt (1993) referred to
uniformity (homogeneity) of dress as one dimension, and conspicuousness as a
second.[2] Employees all wearing black, for example, may appear conspicuous and
thus represent the organization even though their attire is uniform only in the
color of their appearance, not in its features. Pratt & Rafaeli, (1997)
described struggles between employees and management about organizational dress
as struggles about deeper meanings and identities that dress represents.[3] And
Pratt & Rafaeli (2001) described dress as one of the larger set of symbols_and
artifacts_in_organizations which coalesce into a communication grammar.[4]
***** Educational[edit] *****
Main article: School_uniform

Uniforms are required for students in many schools in different countries.
School uniforms vary from a standard issue T-shirt to rigorous requirements for
many items of formal wear at private schools. School uniforms are in place in
many public schools as well.
Countries with mandatory school uniforms include Japan, South_Korea, Hong_Kong,
Thailand, India, Australia, U.A.E, Singapore, Philippines, some schools in
Taiwan, New_Zealand, South_Africa, Indonesia and the United_Kingdom, among as
many other places. In some countries, uniform types vary from school to school,
but in the United Kingdom, many pupils between 11 and 16 of age wear a formal
jacket, tie and trousers for boys and blouse, tie and trousers, skirt, or
culottes for girls. The ties will have a set pattern or a logo embroidered for
the school, and jackets will usually carry a badge on the breast pocket with
the school's name, coat_of_arms, and motto or emblem. Jackets are being
replaced in many schools by sweatshirts bearing the school badge. Children in
many United Kingdom state primary schools will have a uniform jumper and/or
polo shirt with the school name and logo.
***** Diplomats[edit] *****
Main article: Diplomatic_uniform
From about 1800 to after the Second World War, diplomats from most countries
(and often senior non-military officials generally) wore official uniforms at
public occasions. Such uniforms are now retained by only a few diplomatic
services, and are seldom worn.
***** Prison[edit] *****
Prisoners in Utah (c. 1885) wearing striped prison_uniforms. Prison often
require inmates to wear uniforms.
Main article: Prison_uniform
A prison uniform is any uniform worn by individuals incarcerated in a prison,
jail or similar facility of detention.
***** Sports[edit] *****
See also: Sportswear_(activewear), Baseball_uniform, Basketball_uniform,
Cricket_whites, Kit_(association_football), Uniform_(American_football), and
Jersey_(sport)
Most, if not all, sports teams also wear uniforms, made in the team's
distinctive colors. In individual sports like tennis and golf, players may
choose any clothing design allowed by the competition rules.
To prevent the confusion (for officials, players, and fans) that might result
from two opposing teams wearing uniforms (kits) with similar colors, teams have
different variations for "home" and "away" games, where typically one is dark
and the other is light. In the four major_North_American_sports_leagues, one of
the two uniforms is almost always predominantly white, and each league except
for the National_Basketball_Association (NBA) has a rule to determine which
team should normally wear its white uniform. Customarily, National_Football
League (NFL) and National_Hockey_League (NHL) teams wear their color uniforms
for home games. By contrast, Major_League_Baseball (MLB) teams wear their white
uniforms for home games. The NBA traditionally required home teams to wear
white, or at least a light color, but as of the 2017â18 season allows home
teams to wear any uniform color, mandating only that away teams wear a color
that sufficiently contrasts with the home team's choice.[5] These rules are not
strictly enforced, however, for any of the four major professional sports
leagues in North America. Some NFL teams, most notably the Dallas_Cowboys,
prefer to wear their white jerseys for home games. When Joe_Gibbs was the head
coach of the Washington_Redskins — first from 1981-1992, and again from 2004-
2007 — the Redskins exclusively wore white jerseys at home games.[6] In the
United_Kingdom, especially in football, the terms "kit" or "strip" (as in
'football_kit') are more common (instead of uniform).
***** Security and armed forces[edit] *****
Main article: Military_uniform
A Russian honor guard wearing their full dress_uniforms. Full dress is a formal
uniform typically worn in ceremonies.
Military uniform is the standardised dress worn by members of the armed_forces
and paramilitaries of various nations. Military dress and military styles have
gone through great changes over the centuries from colourful and elaborate to
extremely utilitarian. Military uniforms in the form of standardised and
distinctive dress, intended for identification and display, are typically a
sign of organised military forces equipped by a central authority. The
utilitarian necessities of war and economic frugality are now the dominant
factors in uniform design. Most military forces, however, have developed
several different uniform types.
Military personnel in most armed forces and some civilian officials may wear
some or all of the following:
    * combat_uniform
    * service dress
    * dress_uniform
    * full_dress_uniform
    * mess_dress
***** Police[edit] *****
A uniformed police_officer in Sweden. The police often wear uniforms to
distinguish themselves in public.
See also: Police_Â§ Uniformed_police, Police_uniforms_and_equipment_in_the
United_Kingdom, Police_uniforms_in_the_United_States, and Uniforms_of_the
Singapore_Police_Force
Members of the police in every country have a uniform for identification as
law-enforcement personnel or agents. They are distinguished from the public by
the uniform the police wear during overt policing activity. Usually each
country has its own different police uniform.
Contrast plainclothes_law_enforcement and undercover_operations.
***** Medical workers[edit] *****
Uniforms can distinguish various categories of staff in medical institutions:
doctors, surgeons, nurses, ancillary staff and volunteers.
Note that traditional female nurses'_uniforms resemble uniforms (habits) worn
by religious_orders.[7][8]
Equipment - notably stethoscopes - worn like a badge_of_office, may accompany
or replace medical uniforms.
***** Domestic workers[edit] *****
Domestic_workers are often required by their employers-managers to wear a
uniform.
***** Beautician[edit] *****
The beauticians use uniforms to protect their skin from harmful chemicals and
acid. These chemical resistant and water proof uniforms not only safe to work
in but also provide a professional, polished appearance throughout the day.
***** Scouting[edit] *****
Statue of a Boy_Scout in uniform. The Scout uniform is a specific
characteristic of scouting used in most of their events.
See also: Uniform_and_insignia_of_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America
The Scout uniform is a specific characteristic of the Scouting movement, in the
words of Baden-Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree, "it covers the differences of
country and race and make all feel that they are members one with another of
one World Brotherhood". The original uniform, which has created a familiar
image in the public eye, consisted of a khaki button-up shirt, shorts and a
broad-brimmed campaign_hat. Baden-Powell himself wore shorts since being
dressed like the youth contributed to reducing perceived "distance" between the
adult and the young person. Nowadays, uniforms are frequently blue, orange,
red, or green, and shorts are replaced by long pants in areas where the culture
calls for modesty, and in winter weather. The campaign hats have also been
dropped in some Scouting organisations.
***** Buttons[edit] *****
Some uniforms have specially-manufactured buttons, which, in the case of
antiques, often outlast the fabric components of the uniform, and become highly
collectable items.[9] Nowadays, buttons come in different materials, shapes
sizes and colors.
***** Hygiene[edit] *****
In some countries or regions such as the UK, Australia or Hong_Kong, the cost
of cleaning one's uniform or work clothing can be partially deducted or rebated
from the personal income_tax, if the organization for which the person works
does not have a laundry department or an outsourced commercial_laundry.[10][11]
