The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated
system can never decrease over time. The total entropy of a system and its
surroundings can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in
thermodynamic_equilibrium, or is undergoing a (fictive) reversible_process. In
all processes that occur, including spontaneous_processes,[1] the total entropy
of the system and its surroundings increases and the process is irreversible_in
the_thermodynamic_sense. The increase in entropy accounts for the
irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry_between_future_and
past.[2]
Historically, the second law was an empirical_finding that was accepted as an
axiom of thermodynamic_theory. Statistical_mechanics, classical or quantum,
explains the microscopic origin of the law.
The second law has been expressed in many ways. Its first formulation is
credited to the French scientist Sadi_Carnot, who in 1824 showed that there is
an upper limit to the efficiency of conversion of heat to work, in a heat
engine.

***** Introduction[edit] *****
Heat flow from hot water to cold water.
The first_law_of_thermodynamics provides the basic definition of internal
energy, associated with all thermodynamic_systems, and states the rule of
conservation_of_energy.[3][4] The second law is concerned with the direction of
natural processes.[5] It asserts that a natural process runs only in one sense,
and is not reversible. For example, heat always flows spontaneously from hotter
to colder bodies, and never the reverse, unless external work is performed on
the system. The explanation of the phenomena was given in terms of entropy.[6]
[7] Total entropy (S) can never decrease over time for an isolated system
because the entropy of an isolated system spontaneously evolves toward
thermodynamic equilibrium: the entropy should stay the same or increase.
In a fictive reversible process, an infinitesimal increment in the entropy (dS)
of a system is defined to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat (Î´Q)
to a closed_system (which allows the entry or exit of energy â but not mass
transfer) divided by the common temperature (T) of the system in equilibrium
and the surroundings which supply the heat:[8]
          d  S =    &#x03B4; Q  T                           (closed system,
      idealized fictive reversible process)  .   {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} S=
      {\frac {\delta Q}{T}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text
      {(closed system, idealized fictive reversible process)}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} S={\frac {\delta Q}
      {T}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed system,
      idealized fictive reversible process)}}.}]
Different notations are used for infinitesimal amounts of heat (Î´) and
infinitesimal amounts of entropy (d) because entropy is a function_of_state,
while heat, like work, is not. For an actually possible infinitesimal process
without exchange of mass with the surroundings, the second law requires that
the increment in system entropy fulfills the inequality [9][10]
          d  S >    &#x03B4; Q   T  s u r r                             (closed
      system, actually possible, irreversible process).    {\displaystyle
      \mathrm {d} S>{\frac {\delta Q}{T_
      {surr}}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed
      system, actually possible, irreversible process).}}}  [{\displaystyle
      \mathrm {d} S>{\frac {\delta Q}{T_
      {surr}}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed
      system, actually possible, irreversible process).}}}]
This is because a general process for this case may include work being done on
the system by its surroundings, which can have frictional or viscous effects
inside the system, because a chemical reaction may be in progress, or because
heat transfer actually occurs only irreversibly, driven by a finite difference
between the system temperature (T) and the temperature of the surroundings
(Tsurr).[11][12] Note that the equality still applies for pure heat flow,[13]
          d  S =    &#x03B4; Q  T                           (actually possible
      quasistatic irreversible process without composition change).
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} S={\frac {\delta Q}
      {T}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(actually
      possible quasistatic irreversible process without composition change).}}}
      [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} S={\frac {\delta Q}
      {T}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(actually
      possible quasistatic irreversible process without composition
      change).}}}]
which is the basis of the accurate determination of the absolute entropy of
pure substances from measured heat capacity curves and entropy changes at phase
transitions, i.e. by calorimetry.[14] [9] Introducing a set of internal
variables     &#x03BE;   {\displaystyle \xi }  [\xi ] to describe the deviation
of a thermodynamic system in physical equilibrium (with the required well-
defined uniform pressure P and temperature T)[13] from the chemical equilibrium
state, one can record the equality
          d  S =    &#x03B4; Q  T   &#x2212;   1 T    &#x2211;  j     &#x039E;
      j    &#x03B4;  &#x03BE;  j                           (closed system,
      actually possible quasistatic irreversible process).    {\displaystyle
      \mathrm {d} S={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}-{\frac {1}{T}}\sum _{j}\,\Xi _
      {j}\,\delta \xi _{j}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{
      (closed system, actually possible quasistatic irreversible process).}}}
      [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} S={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}-{\frac {1}{T}}\sum _
      {j}\,\Xi _{j}\,\delta \xi _
      {j}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed system,
      actually possible quasistatic irreversible process).}}}]
The second term represents work of internal variables that can be perturbed by
external influences, but the system cannot perform any positive work via
internal variables. This statement introduces the impossibility of the
reversion of evolution of the thermodynamic system in time and can be
considered as a formulation of the second principle of thermodynamics â the
formulation, which is, of course, equivalent to the formulation of the
principle in terms of entropy.[15][16]

The zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics in its usual short statement allows
recognition that two bodies in a relation of thermal equilibrium have the same
temperature, especially that a test body has the same temperature as a
reference thermometric body.[17] For a body in thermal equilibrium with
another, there are indefinitely many empirical temperature scales, in general
respectively depending on the properties of a particular reference thermometric
body. The second law allows[how?] a distinguished temperature scale, which
defines an absolute, thermodynamic_temperature, independent of the properties
of any particular reference thermometric body.[18][19]
***** Various statements of the law[edit] *****
The second law of thermodynamics may be expressed in many specific ways,[20]
the most prominent classical statements[21] being the statement by Rudolf
Clausius (1854), the statement by Lord_Kelvin (1851), and the statement in
axiomatic thermodynamics by Constantin_CarathÃ©odory (1909). These statements
cast the law in general physical terms citing the impossibility of certain
processes. The Clausius and the Kelvin statements have been shown to be
equivalent.[22]
**** Carnot's principle[edit] ****
The historical origin of the second law of thermodynamics was in Carnot's
principle. It refers to a cycle of a Carnot_heat_engine, fictively operated in
the limiting mode of extreme slowness known as quasi-static, so that the heat
and work transfers are between subsystems that are always in their own internal
states of thermodynamic equilibrium. The Carnot engine is an idealized device
of special interest to engineers who are concerned with the efficiency of heat
engines. Carnot's principle was recognized by Carnot at a time when the caloric
theory of heat was seriously considered, before the recognition of the first
law_of_thermodynamics, and before the mathematical expression of the concept of
entropy. Interpreted in the light of the first law, it is physically equivalent
to the second law of thermodynamics, and remains valid today. In concise terms,
Carnot's original statement was made from the viewpoint of the caloric theory,
before the discovery of the first law of thermodynamics:
            The production of motive power is due ... not to any real
            consumption of caloric, but to its transport from a warm body to a
            cold body ...[23]
In modern terms, Carnot's principle may be stated more elaborately:
            The efficiency of a quasi-static or reversible Carnot cycle depends
            only on the temperatures of the two heat reservoirs, and is the
            same, whatever the working substance. A Carnot engine operated in
            this way is the most efficient possible heat engine using those two
            temperatures.[24][25][26][27][28][29][30]
**** Clausius statement[edit] ****
The German scientist Rudolf_Clausius laid the foundation for the second law of
thermodynamics in 1850 by examining the relation between heat transfer and
work.[31] His formulation of the second law, which was published in German in
1854, is known as the Clausius statement:
     Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other
     change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time.[32]
The statement by Clausius uses the concept of 'passage of heat'. As is usual in
thermodynamic discussions, this means 'net transfer of energy as heat', and
does not refer to contributory transfers one way and the other.
Heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold regions to hot regions without
external work being performed on the system, which is evident from ordinary
experience of refrigeration, for example. In a refrigerator, heat flows from
cold to hot, but only when forced by an external agent, the refrigeration
system.
**** Kelvin statement[edit] ****
Lord_Kelvin expressed the second law as
            It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive
            mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below
            the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.[33]
**** Equivalence of the Clausius and the Kelvin statements[edit] ****
Derive Kelvin Statement from Clausius Statement
Suppose there is an engine violating the Kelvin statement: i.e., one that
drains heat and converts it completely into work in a cyclic fashion without
any other result. Now pair it with a reversed Carnot_engine as shown by the
figure. The net and sole effect of this newly created engine consisting of the
two engines mentioned is transferring heat     &#x0394; Q = Q  (    1 &#x03B7;
&#x2212; 1  )    {\displaystyle \Delta Q=Q\left({\frac {1}{\eta }}-1\right)}
[\Delta Q=Q\left(\frac{1}{\eta}-1\right)] from the cooler reservoir to the
hotter one, which violates the Clausius statement(This is a consequence of the
first_law_of_thermodynamics, as for the total system's energy to remain the
same,      Input  +  Output  = 0  &#x27F9;  Q +   Q &#x03B7;   = &#x2212;  Q  c
{\displaystyle {\text{Input}}+{\text{Output}}=0\implies Q+{\frac {Q}{\eta }}=-
Q_{c}}  [{\displaystyle {\text{Input}}+{\text{Output}}=0\implies Q+{\frac {Q}
{\eta }}=-Q_{c}}], so therefore      Q  c   = Q  (    1 &#x03B7;   &#x2212; 1
)    {\displaystyle Q_{c}=Q\left({\frac {1}{\eta }}-1\right)}  [{\displaystyle
Q_{c}=Q\left({\frac {1}{\eta }}-1\right)}] ). Thus a violation of the Kelvin
statement implies a violation of the Clausius statement, i.e. the Clausius
statement implies the Kelvin statement. We can prove in a similar manner that
the Kelvin statement implies the Clausius statement, and hence the two are
equivalent.
**** Planck's proposition[edit] ****
Planck offered the following proposition as derived directly from experience.
This is sometimes regarded as his statement of the second law, but he regarded
it as a starting point for the derivation of the second law.
            It is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a
            complete cycle, and produce no effect except the raising of a
            weight and cooling of a heat reservoir.[34][35]
**** Relation between Kelvin's statement and Planck's proposition[edit] ****
It is almost customary in textbooks to speak of the "Kelvin-Planck_statement"
of the law, as for example in the text by ter_Haar and Wergeland.[36]
The KelvinâPlanck statement (or the heat engine statement) of the second law
of thermodynamics states that
            It is impossible to devise a cyclically operating device, the sole
            effect of which is to absorb energy in the form of heat from a
            single thermal_reservoir and to deliver an equivalent amount of
            work.[37]
**** Planck's statement[edit] ****
Planck stated the second law as follows.
            Every process occurring in nature proceeds in the sense in which
            the sum of the entropies of all bodies taking part in the process
            is increased. In the limit, i.e. for reversible processes, the sum
            of the entropies remains unchanged.[38][39][40]
Rather like Planck's statement is that of Uhlenbeck and Ford for irreversible
phenomena.
            ... in an irreversible or spontaneous change from one equilibrium
            state to another (as for example the equalization of temperature of
            two bodies A and B, when brought in contact) the entropy always
            increases.[41]
**** Principle of CarathÃ©odory[edit] ****
Constantin_CarathÃ©odory formulated thermodynamics on a purely mathematical
axiomatic foundation. His statement of the second law is known as the Principle
of CarathÃ©odory, which may be formulated as follows:[42]
     In every neighborhood of any state S of an adiabatically enclosed
     system there are states inaccessible from S.[43]
With this formulation, he described the concept of adiabatic_accessibility for
the first time and provided the foundation for a new subfield of classical
thermodynamics, often called geometrical_thermodynamics. It follows from
CarathÃ©odory's principle that quantity of energy quasi-statically transferred
as heat is a holonomic process_function, in other words,     &#x03B4; Q = T d S
{\displaystyle \delta Q=TdS}  [\delta Q=TdS].[44][clarification_needed]
Though it is almost customary in textbooks to say that CarathÃ©odory's
principle expresses the second law and to treat it as equivalent to the
Clausius or to the Kelvin-Planck statements, such is not the case. To get all
the content of the second law, CarathÃ©odory's principle needs to be
supplemented by Planck's principle, that isochoric work always increases the
internal energy of a closed system that was initially in its own internal
thermodynamic equilibrium.[12][45][46][47][clarification_needed]
**** Planck's principle[edit] ****
In 1926, Max_Planck wrote an important paper on the basics of thermodynamics.
[46][48] He indicated the principle
            The internal energy of a closed system is increased by an adiabatic
            process, throughout the duration of which, the volume of the system
            remains constant.[12][45]
This formulation does not mention heat and does not mention temperature, nor
even entropy, and does not necessarily implicitly rely on those concepts, but
it implies the content of the second law. A closely related statement is that
"Frictional pressure never does positive work."[49] Using a now-obsolete form
of words, Planck himself wrote: "The production of heat by friction is
irreversible."[50][51]
Not mentioning entropy, this principle of Planck is stated in physical terms.
It is very closely related to the Kelvin statement given just above.[52] It is
relevant that for a system at constant volume and mole_numbers, the entropy is
a monotonic function of the internal energy. Nevertheless, this principle of
Planck is not actually Planck's preferred statement of the second law, which is
quoted above, in a previous sub-section of the present section of this present
article, and relies on the concept of entropy.
A statement that in a sense is complementary to Planck's principle is made by
Borgnakke and Sonntag. They do not offer it as a full statement of the second
law:
            ... there is only one way in which the entropy of a [closed] system
            can be decreased, and that is to transfer heat from the system.[53]
Differing from Planck's just foregoing principle, this one is explicitly in
terms of entropy change. Removal of matter from a system can also decrease its
entropy.
**** Statement for a system that has a known expression of its internal energy
as a function of its extensive state variables[edit] ****
The second law has been shown to be equivalent to the internal_energy U being a
weakly convex_function, when written as a function of extensive properties
(mass, volume, entropy, ...).[54][55][clarification_needed]
***** Corollaries[edit] *****
**** Perpetual motion of the second kind[edit] ****
Main article: Perpetual_motion
Before the establishment of the second law, many people who were interested in
inventing a perpetual motion machine had tried to circumvent the restrictions
of first_law_of_thermodynamics by extracting the massive internal energy of the
environment as the power of the machine. Such a machine is called a "perpetual
motion machine of the second kind". The second law declared the impossibility
of such machines.
**** Carnot theorem[edit] ****
Carnot's_theorem (1824) is a principle that limits the maximum efficiency for
any possible engine. The efficiency solely depends on the temperature
difference between the hot and cold thermal reservoirs. Carnot's theorem
states:
    * All irreversible heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less
      efficient than a Carnot_engine operating between the same reservoirs.
    * All reversible heat engines between two heat reservoirs are equally
      efficient with a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.
In his ideal model, the heat of caloric converted into work could be reinstated
by reversing the motion of the cycle, a concept subsequently known as
thermodynamic_reversibility. Carnot, however, further postulated that some
caloric is lost, not being converted to mechanical work. Hence, no real heat
engine could realise the Carnot_cycle's reversibility and was condemned to be
less efficient.
Though formulated in terms of caloric (see the obsolete caloric_theory), rather
than entropy, this was an early insight into the second law.
**** Clausius inequality[edit] ****
The Clausius_theorem (1854) states that in a cyclic process
            &#x222E;      &#x2061;    &#x03B4; Q  T   &#x2264; 0.
      {\displaystyle \oint {\frac {\delta Q}{T}}\leq 0.}  [\oint \frac{\delta
      Q}{T} \leq 0.]
The equality holds in the reversible case[56] and the strict inequality holds
in the irreversible case. The reversible case is used to introduce the state
function entropy. This is because in cyclic processes the variation of a state
function is zero from state functionality.
**** Thermodynamic temperature[edit] ****
Main article: Thermodynamic_temperature
For an arbitrary heat engine, the efficiency is:
         &#x03B7; =    W  n    q  H     =     q  H   &#x2212;  q  C     q  H
      = 1 &#x2212;    q  C    q  H      ( 1 )   {\displaystyle \eta ={\frac {W_
      {n}}{q_{H}}}={\frac {q_{H}-q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=1-{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}\qquad
      (1)}  [{\displaystyle \eta ={\frac {W_{n}}{q_{H}}}={\frac {q_{H}-q_{C}}
      {q_{H}}}=1-{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}\qquad (1)}]
where Wn is for the net work done per cycle. Thus the efficiency depends only
on qC/qH.
Carnot's_theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same
heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, any reversible heat engine
operating between temperatures T1 and T2 must have the same efficiency, that is
to say, the efficiency is the function of temperatures only:        q  C    q
H     = f (  T  H   ,  T  C   )  ( 2 ) .   {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{C}}{q_
{H}}}=f(T_{H},T_{C})\qquad (2).}  [{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=f(T_{H},T_{C})\qquad
(2).]
In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures T1 and T3
must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between T1
and another (intermediate) temperature T2, and the second between T2 andT3.
This can only be the case if
         f (  T  1   ,  T  3   ) =    q  3    q  1     =     q  2    q  3
      q  1    q  2      = f (  T  1   ,  T  2   ) f (  T  2   ,  T  3   ) .
      {\displaystyle f(T_{1},T_{3})={\frac {q_{3}}{q_{1}}}={\frac {q_{2}q_{3}}
      {q_{1}q_{2}}}=f(T_{1},T_{2})f(T_{2},T_{3}).}  [

      f(T_1,T_3) = \frac{q_3}{q_1} = \frac{q_2 q_3} {q_1 q_2} = f(T_1,T_2)f
      (T_2,T_3).
      ]
Now consider the case where      T  1     {\displaystyle T_{1}}  [T_{1}] is a
fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple_point of water. Then
for any T2 and T3,
         f (  T  2   ,  T  3   ) =    f (  T  1   ,  T  3   )   f (  T  1   ,
      T  2   )    =    273.16 &#x22C5; f (  T  1   ,  T  3   )   273.16
      &#x22C5; f (  T  1   ,  T  2   )    .   {\displaystyle f(T_{2},T_{3})=
      {\frac {f(T_{1},T_{3})}{f(T_{1},T_{2})}}={\frac {273.16\cdot f(T_{1},T_
      {3})}{273.16\cdot f(T_{1},T_{2})}}.}  [f(T_2,T_3) = \frac{f(T_1,T_3)}{f
      (T_1,T_2)} = \frac{273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T_3)}{273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T_2)}.]
Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by
         T = 273.16 &#x22C5; f (  T  1   , T )    {\displaystyle T=273.16\cdot
      f(T_{1},T)\,}  [T = 273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T) \,]
then the function f, viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is
simply
         f (  T  2   ,  T  3   ) =    T  3    T  2     ,   {\displaystyle f(T_
      {2},T_{3})={\frac {T_{3}}{T_{2}}},}  [f(T_2,T_3) = \frac{T_3}{T_2},]
and the reference temperature T1 will have the value 273.16. (Any reference
temperature and any positive numerical value could be used – the choice here
corresponds to the Kelvin scale.)
**** Entropy[edit] ****
Main article: Entropy_(classical_thermodynamics)
According to the Clausius_equality, for a reversible process
            &#x222E;      &#x2061;    &#x03B4; Q  T   = 0   {\displaystyle
      \oint {\frac {\delta Q}{T}}=0}  [\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T}=0]
That means the line integral      &#x222B;  L      &#x03B4; Q  T
{\displaystyle \int _{L}{\frac {\delta Q}{T}}}  [\int_L \frac{\delta Q}{T}] is
path independent for reversible processes.
So we can define a state function S called entropy, which for a reversible
process or for pure heat transfer[13] satisfies
         d S =    &#x03B4; Q  T      {\displaystyle dS={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}\!}
      [dS = \frac{\delta Q}{T} \!]
With this we can only obtain the difference of entropy by integrating the above
formula. To obtain the absolute value, we need the third_law_of_thermodynamics,
which states that S = 0 at absolute_zero for perfect crystals.
For any irreversible process, since entropy is a state function, we can always
connect the initial and terminal states with an imaginary reversible process
and integrating on that path to calculate the difference in entropy.
Now reverse the reversible process and combine it with the said irreversible
process. Applying the Clausius_inequality on this loop,
         &#x2212; &#x0394; S + &#x222B;    &#x03B4; Q  T   =    &#x222E;
      &#x2061;    &#x03B4; Q  T   < 0   {\displaystyle -\Delta S+\int {\frac
      {\delta Q}{T}}=\oint {\frac {\delta Q}{T}}<0}  [-\Delta S+\int\frac
      {\delta Q}{T}=\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T}< 0]
Thus,
         &#x0394; S &#x2265; &#x222B;    &#x03B4; Q  T       {\displaystyle
      \Delta S\geq \int {\frac {\delta Q}{T}}\,\!}  [\Delta S \ge \int \frac
      {\delta Q}{T} \,\!]
where the equality holds if the transformation is reversible.
Notice that if the process is an adiabatic_process, then     &#x03B4; Q = 0
{\displaystyle \delta Q=0}  [\delta Q=0], so     &#x0394; S &#x2265; 0
{\displaystyle \Delta S\geq 0}  [\Delta S\ge 0].
**** Energy, available useful work[edit] ****
See also: Exergy
An important and revealing idealized special case is to consider applying the
Second Law to the scenario of an isolated system (called the total system or
universe), made up of two parts: a sub-system of interest, and the sub-system's
surroundings. These surroundings are imagined to be so large that they can be
considered as an unlimited heat reservoir at temperature TR and pressure PR  –
so that no matter how much heat is transferred to (or from) the sub-system, the
temperature of the surroundings will remain TR; and no matter how much the
volume of the sub-system expands (or contracts), the pressure of the
surroundings will remain PR.
Whatever changes to dS and dSR occur in the entropies of the sub-system and the
surroundings individually, according to the Second Law the entropy Stot of the
isolated total system must not decrease:
         d  S   t o t    = d S + d  S  R   &#x2265; 0   {\displaystyle dS_
      {\mathrm {tot} }=dS+dS_{R}\geq 0}  [ dS_{\mathrm{tot}}= dS + dS_R \ge 0 ]
According to the first_law_of_thermodynamics, the change dU in the internal
energy of the sub-system is the sum of the heat Î´q added to the sub-system,
less any work Î´w done by the sub-system, plus any net chemical energy entering
the sub-system d âÎ¼iRNi, so that:
         d U = &#x03B4; q &#x2212; &#x03B4; w + d ( &#x2211;  &#x03BC;  i R
      N  i   )    {\displaystyle dU=\delta q-\delta w+d(\sum \mu _{iR}N_{i})\,}
      [ dU = \delta q - \delta w + d(\sum \mu_{iR}N_i) \,]
where Î¼iR are the chemical_potentials of chemical species in the external
surroundings.
Now the heat leaving the reservoir and entering the sub-system is
         &#x03B4; q =  T  R   ( &#x2212; d  S  R   ) &#x2264;  T  R   d S
      {\displaystyle \delta q=T_{R}(-dS_{R})\leq T_{R}dS}  [ \delta q = T_R (-
      dS_R) \le T_R dS ]
where we have first used the definition of entropy in classical thermodynamics
(alternatively, in statistical thermodynamics, the relation between entropy
change, temperature and absorbed heat can be derived); and then the Second Law
inequality from above.
It therefore follows that any net work Î´w done by the sub-system must obey
         &#x03B4; w &#x2264; &#x2212; d U +  T  R   d S + &#x2211;  &#x03BC;  i
      R   d  N  i      {\displaystyle \delta w\leq -dU+T_{R}dS+\sum \mu _
      {iR}dN_{i}\,}  [ \delta w \le - dU + T_R dS + \sum \mu_{iR} dN_i \,]
It is useful to separate the work Î´w done by the subsystem into the useful
work Î´wu that can be done by the sub-system, over and beyond the work pR dV
done merely by the sub-system expanding against the surrounding external
pressure, giving the following relation for the useful work (exergy) that can
be done:
         &#x03B4;  w  u   &#x2264; &#x2212; d ( U &#x2212;  T  R   S +  p  R
      V &#x2212; &#x2211;  &#x03BC;  i R    N  i   )    {\displaystyle \delta
      w_{u}\leq -d(U-T_{R}S+p_{R}V-\sum \mu _{iR}N_{i})\,}  [ \delta w_u \le -
      d (U - T_R S + p_R V - \sum \mu_{iR} N_i )\,]
It is convenient to define the right-hand-side as the exact derivative of a
thermodynamic potential, called the availability or exergy E of the subsystem,
         E = U &#x2212;  T  R   S +  p  R   V &#x2212; &#x2211;  &#x03BC;  i R
      N  i     {\displaystyle E=U-T_{R}S+p_{R}V-\sum \mu _{iR}N_{i}}  [ E = U -
      T_R S + p_R V - \sum \mu_{iR} N_i ]
The Second Law therefore implies that for any process which can be considered
as divided simply into a subsystem, and an unlimited temperature and pressure
reservoir with which it is in contact,
         d E + &#x03B4;  w  u   &#x2264; 0    {\displaystyle dE+\delta w_
      {u}\leq 0\,}  [ dE + \delta w_u \le 0 \, ]
i.e. the change in the subsystem's exergy plus the useful work done by the
subsystem (or, the change in the subsystem's exergy less any work, additional
to that done by the pressure reservoir, done on the system) must be less than
or equal to zero.
In sum, if a proper infinite-reservoir-like reference state is chosen as the
system surroundings in the real world, then the Second Law predicts a decrease
in E for an irreversible process and no change for a reversible process.
         d  S  t o t   &#x2265; 0   {\displaystyle dS_{tot}\geq 0}  [dS_{tot}
      \ge 0 ] Is equivalent to     d E + &#x03B4;  w  u   &#x2264; 0
      {\displaystyle dE+\delta w_{u}\leq 0}  [ dE + \delta w_u \le 0 ]
This expression together with the associated reference state permits a design
engineer working at the macroscopic scale (above the thermodynamic_limit) to
utilize the Second Law without directly measuring or considering entropy change
in a total isolated system. (Also, see process_engineer). Those changes have
already been considered by the assumption that the system under consideration
can reach equilibrium with the reference state without altering the reference
state. An efficiency for a process or collection of processes that compares it
to the reversible ideal may also be found (See second_law_efficiency.)
This approach to the Second Law is widely utilized in engineering practice,
environmental_accounting, systems_ecology, and other disciplines.
**** The second law in chemical thermodynamics[edit] ****
For a spontaneous_chemical_process in a closed system at constant temperature
and pressure without non-PV work, the Clausius inequality ÎS > Q/Tsurr
transforms into a condition for the change in Gibbs_free_energy
         &#x0394; G < 0   {\displaystyle \Delta G<0}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
      G<0}]
or dG < 0. For a similar process at constant temperature and volume, the change
in Helmholtz_free_energy must be negative,     &#x0394; A < 0   {\displaystyle
\Delta A<0}  [{\displaystyle \Delta A<0}]. Thus, a negative value of the change
in free energy (G or A) is a necessary condition for a process to be
spontaneous. This is the most useful form of the second law of thermodynamics
in chemistry, where free-energy changes can be calculated from tabulated
enthalpies of formation and standard molar entropies of reactants and products.
[14] [9] The chemical equilibrium condition at constant T and p without
electrical work is dG = 0.
***** History[edit] *****
See also: History_of_entropy
Nicolas LÃ©onard Sadi Carnot in the traditional uniform of a student of the
Ãcole_Polytechnique.
The first theory of the conversion of heat into mechanical work is due to
Nicolas_LÃ©onard_Sadi_Carnot in 1824. He was the first to realize correctly
that the efficiency of this conversion depends on the difference of temperature
between an engine and its environment.
Recognizing the significance of James_Prescott_Joule's work on the conservation
of energy, Rudolf_Clausius was the first to formulate the second law during
1850, in this form: heat does not flow spontaneously from cold to hot bodies.
While common knowledge now, this was contrary to the caloric_theory of heat
popular at the time, which considered heat as a fluid. From there he was able
to infer the principle of Sadi Carnot and the definition of entropy (1865).
Established during the 19th century, the Kelvin-Planck_statement_of_the_Second
Law says, "It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive
heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work." This was shown
to be equivalent to the statement of Clausius.
The ergodic_hypothesis is also important for the Boltzmann approach. It says
that, over long periods of time, the time spent in some region of the phase
space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this
region, i.e. that all accessible microstates are equally probable over a long
period of time. Equivalently, it says that time average and average over the
statistical ensemble are the same.
There is a traditional doctrine, starting with Clausius, that entropy can be
understood in terms of molecular 'disorder' within a macroscopic_system. This
doctrine is obsolescent.[57][58][59]
**** Account given by Clausius[edit] ****
Rudolf Clausius
In 1856, the German physicist Rudolf_Clausius stated what he called the "second
fundamental theorem in the mechanical_theory_of_heat" in the following form:
[60]
         &#x222B;    &#x03B4; Q  T   = &#x2212; N   {\displaystyle \int {\frac
      {\delta Q}{T}}=-N}  [\int \frac{\delta Q}{T} = -N]
where Q is heat, T is temperature and N is the "equivalence-value" of all
uncompensated transformations involved in a cyclical process. Later, in 1865,
Clausius would come to define "equivalence-value" as entropy. On the heels of
this definition, that same year, the most famous version of the second law was
read in a presentation at the Philosophical Society of Zurich on April 24, in
which, in the end of his presentation, Clausius concludes:
     The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.
This statement is the best-known phrasing of the second law. Because of the
looseness of its language, e.g. universe, as well as lack of specific
conditions, e.g. open, closed, or isolated, many people take this simple
statement to mean that the second law of thermodynamics applies virtually to
every subject imaginable. This is not true; this statement is only a simplified
version of a more extended and precise description.
In terms of time variation, the mathematical statement of the second law for an
isolated_system undergoing an arbitrary transformation is:
            d S   d t    &#x2265; 0   {\displaystyle {\frac {dS}{dt}}\geq 0}
      [\frac{dS}{dt} \ge 0]
where
      S is the entropy of the system and
      t is time.
The equality sign applies after equilibration. An alternative way of
formulating of the second law for isolated systems is:
            d S   d t    =     S &#x02D9;     i     {\displaystyle {\frac {dS}
      {dt}}={\dot {S}}_{i}}  [\frac{dS}{dt} = \dot S_{i}] with         S
      &#x02D9;     i   &#x2265; 0   {\displaystyle {\dot {S}}_{i}\geq 0}
      [ \dot S_{i} \ge 0]
with         S &#x02D9;     i     {\displaystyle {\dot {S}}_{i}}  [ \dot S_{i}]
the sum of the rate of entropy_production by all processes inside the system.
The advantage of this formulation is that it shows the effect of the entropy
production. The rate of entropy production is a very important concept since it
determines (limits) the efficiency of thermal machines. Multiplied with ambient
temperature      T  a     {\displaystyle T_{a}}  [T_{a}] it gives the so-called
dissipated energy      P  d i s s   =  T  a       S &#x02D9;     i
{\displaystyle P_{diss}=T_{a}{\dot {S}}_{i}}  [ P_{diss}=T_{a}\dot S_{i}].
The expression of the second law for closed systems (so, allowing heat exchange
and moving boundaries, but not exchange of matter) is:
            d S   d t    =     Q &#x02D9;   T   +     S &#x02D9;     i
      {\displaystyle {\frac {dS}{dt}}={\frac {\dot {Q}}{T}}+{\dot {S}}_{i}}
      [\frac{dS}{dt} = \frac{\dot Q}{T}+\dot S_{i}] with         S &#x02D9;
      i   &#x2265; 0   {\displaystyle {\dot {S}}_{i}\geq 0}  [ \dot S_{i} \ge
      0]
Here
            Q &#x02D9;      {\displaystyle {\dot {Q}}}  [{\dot {Q}}] is the
      heat flow into the system
         T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] is the temperature at the point where the
      heat enters the system.
The equality sign holds in the case that only reversible processes take place
inside the system. If irreversible processes take place (which is the case in
real systems in operation) the >-sign holds. If heat is supplied to the system
at several places we have to take the algebraic sum of the corresponding terms.
For open systems (also allowing exchange of matter):
            d S   d t    =     Q &#x02D9;   T   +    S &#x02D9;    +     S
      &#x02D9;     i     {\displaystyle {\frac {dS}{dt}}={\frac {\dot {Q}}{T}}+
      {\dot {S}}+{\dot {S}}_{i}}  [\frac{dS}{dt} = \frac{\dot Q}{T}+\dot S+\dot
      S_{i}] with         S &#x02D9;     i   &#x2265; 0   {\displaystyle {\dot
      {S}}_{i}\geq 0}  [ \dot S_{i} \ge 0]
Here        S &#x02D9;      {\displaystyle {\dot {S}}}  [\dot S] is the flow of
entropy into the system associated with the flow of matter entering the system.
It should not be confused with the time derivative of the entropy. If matter is
supplied at several places we have to take the algebraic sum of these
contributions.
***** Statistical mechanics[edit] *****
Statistical_mechanics gives an explanation for the second law by postulating
that a material is composed of atoms and molecules which are in constant
motion. A particular set of positions and velocities for each particle in the
system is called a microstate of the system and because of the constant motion,
the system is constantly changing its microstate. Statistical mechanics
postulates that, in equilibrium, each microstate that the system might be in is
equally likely to occur, and when this assumption is made, it leads directly to
the conclusion that the second law must hold in a statistical sense. That is,
the second law will hold on average, with a statistical variation on the order
of 1/√N where N is the number of particles in the system. For everyday
(macroscopic) situations, the probability that the second law will be violated
is practically zero. However, for systems with a small number of particles,
thermodynamic parameters, including the entropy, may show significant
statistical deviations from that predicted by the second law. Classical
thermodynamic theory does not deal with these statistical variations.
***** Derivation from statistical mechanics[edit] *****
Further information: H-theorem
The first mechanical argument of the Kinetic_theory_of_gases that molecular
collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards
equilibrium was due to James_Clerk_Maxwell in 1860;[61] Ludwig_Boltzmann with
his H-theorem of 1872 also argued that due to collisions gases should over time
tend toward the Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution.
Due to Loschmidt's_paradox, derivations of the Second Law have to make an
assumption regarding the past, namely that the system is uncorrelated at some
time in the past; this allows for simple probabilistic treatment. This
assumption is usually thought as a boundary_condition, and thus the second Law
is ultimately a consequence of the initial conditions somewhere in the past,
probably at the beginning of the universe (the Big_Bang), though other
scenarios have also been suggested.[62][63][64]
Given these assumptions, in statistical mechanics, the Second Law is not a
postulate, rather it is a consequence of the fundamental_postulate, also known
as the equal prior probability postulate, so long as one is clear that simple
probability arguments are applied only to the future, while for the past there
are auxiliary sources of information which tell us that it was low entropy.
[citation_needed] The first part of the second law, which states that the
entropy of a thermally isolated system can only increase, is a trivial
consequence of the equal prior probability postulate, if we restrict the notion
of the entropy to systems in thermal equilibrium. The entropy of an isolated
system in thermal equilibrium containing an amount of energy of     E
{\displaystyle E}  [E] is:
         S =  k   B    ln &#x2061;  [  &#x03A9;  ( E )   ]     {\displaystyle
      S=k_{\mathrm {B} }\ln \left[\Omega \left(E\right)\right]\,}  [S = k_
      {\mathrm B} \ln\left[\Omega\left(E\right)\right]\,]
where     &#x03A9;  ( E )    {\displaystyle \Omega \left(E\right)}
[\Omega\left(E\right)] is the number of quantum states in a small interval
between     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] and     E + &#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle
E+\delta E}  [E +\delta E]. Here     &#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle \delta E}
[\delta E] is a macroscopically small energy interval that is kept fixed.
Strictly speaking this means that the entropy depends on the choice of
&#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle \delta E}  [\delta E]. However, in the
thermodynamic limit (i.e. in the limit of infinitely large system size), the
specific entropy (entropy per unit volume or per unit mass) does not depend on
&#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle \delta E}  [\delta E].
Suppose we have an isolated system whose macroscopic state is specified by a
number of variables. These macroscopic variables can, e.g., refer to the total
volume, the positions of pistons in the system, etc. Then     &#x03A9;
{\displaystyle \Omega }  [\Omega ] will depend on the values of these
variables. If a variable is not fixed, (e.g. we do not clamp a piston in a
certain position), then because all the accessible states are equally likely in
equilibrium, the free variable in equilibrium will be such that     &#x03A9;
{\displaystyle \Omega }  [\Omega ] is maximized as that is the most probable
situation in equilibrium.
If the variable was initially fixed to some value then upon release and when
the new equilibrium has been reached, the fact the variable will adjust itself
so that     &#x03A9;   {\displaystyle \Omega }  [\Omega ] is maximized, implies
that the entropy will have increased or it will have stayed the same (if the
value at which the variable was fixed happened to be the equilibrium value).
Suppose we start from an equilibrium situation and we suddenly remove a
constraint on a variable. Then right after we do this, there are a number
&#x03A9;   {\displaystyle \Omega }  [\Omega ] of accessible microstates, but
equilibrium has not yet been reached, so the actual probabilities of the system
being in some accessible state are not yet equal to the prior probability of
1  /  &#x03A9;   {\displaystyle 1/\Omega }  [1/\Omega]. We have already seen
that in the final equilibrium state, the entropy will have increased or have
stayed the same relative to the previous equilibrium state. Boltzmann's H-
theorem, however, proves that the quantity H increases monotonically as a
function of time during the intermediate out of equilibrium state.
**** Derivation of the entropy change for reversible processes[edit] ****
The second part of the Second Law states that the entropy change of a system
undergoing a reversible process is given by:
         d S =    &#x03B4; Q  T     {\displaystyle dS={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}}
      [dS =\frac{\delta Q}{T}]
where the temperature is defined as:
           1   k   B    T    &#x2261; &#x03B2; &#x2261;    d ln &#x2061;
      [  &#x03A9;  ( E )   ]    d E      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{k_{\mathrm
      {B} }T}}\equiv \beta \equiv {\frac {d\ln \left[\Omega \left
      (E\right)\right]}{dE}}}  [\frac{1}{k_{\mathrm B} T}\equiv\beta\equiv\frac
      {d\ln\left[\Omega\left(E\right)\right]}{dE}]
See here for the justification for this definition. Suppose that the system has
some external parameter, x, that can be changed. In general, the energy
eigenstates of the system will depend on x. According to the adiabatic_theorem
of quantum mechanics, in the limit of an infinitely slow change of the system's
Hamiltonian, the system will stay in the same energy eigenstate and thus change
its energy according to the change in energy of the energy eigenstate it is in.
The generalized force, X, corresponding to the external variable x is defined
such that     X d x   {\displaystyle Xdx}  [X dx] is the work performed by the
system if x is increased by an amount dx. E.g., if x is the volume, then X is
the pressure. The generalized force for a system known to be in energy
eigenstate      E  r     {\displaystyle E_{r}}  [E_{r}] is given by:
         X = &#x2212;    d  E  r     d x      {\displaystyle X=-{\frac {dE_{r}}
      {dx}}}  [X = -\frac{dE_{r}}{dx}]
Since the system can be in any energy eigenstate within an interval of
&#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle \delta E}  [\delta E], we define the generalized
force for the system as the expectation value of the above expression:
         X = &#x2212;  &#x27E8;    d  E  r     d x    &#x27E9;
      {\displaystyle X=-\left\langle {\frac {dE_{r}}{dx}}\right\rangle \,}  [X
      = -\left\langle\frac{dE_{r}}{dx}\right\rangle\,]
To evaluate the average, we partition the     &#x03A9;  ( E )    {\displaystyle
\Omega \left(E\right)}  [\Omega\left(E\right)] energy eigenstates by counting
how many of them have a value for        d  E  r     d x      {\displaystyle
{\frac {dE_{r}}{dx}}}  [\frac{dE_{r}}{dx}] within a range between     Y
{\displaystyle Y}  [Y] and     Y + &#x03B4; Y   {\displaystyle Y+\delta Y}  [Y
+ \delta Y]. Calling this number      &#x03A9;  Y    ( E )    {\displaystyle
\Omega _{Y}\left(E\right)}  [\Omega_{Y}\left(E\right)], we have:
         &#x03A9;  ( E )  =  &#x2211;  Y    &#x03A9;  Y    ( E )
      {\displaystyle \Omega \left(E\right)=\sum _{Y}\Omega _{Y}\left
      (E\right)\,}  [\Omega\left(E\right)=\sum_{Y}\Omega_{Y}\left(E\right)\,]
The average defining the generalized force can now be written:
         X = &#x2212;   1  &#x03A9;  ( E )      &#x2211;  Y   Y  &#x03A9;  Y
      ( E )     {\displaystyle X=-{\frac {1}{\Omega \left(E\right)}}\sum _
      {Y}Y\Omega _{Y}\left(E\right)\,}  [X = -\frac{1}{\Omega\left
      (E\right)}\sum_{Y} Y\Omega_{Y}\left(E\right)\,]
We can relate this to the derivative of the entropy with respect to x at
constant energy E as follows. Suppose we change x to x + dx. Then     &#x03A9;
( E )    {\displaystyle \Omega \left(E\right)}  [\Omega\left(E\right)] will
change because the energy eigenstates depend on x, causing energy eigenstates
to move into or out of the range between     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] and
E + &#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle E+\delta E}  [E+\delta E]. Let's focus again on
the energy eigenstates for which        d  E  r     d x      {\displaystyle
{\frac {dE_{r}}{dx}}}  [\frac{dE_{r}}{dx}] lies within the range between     Y
{\displaystyle Y}  [Y] and     Y + &#x03B4; Y   {\displaystyle Y+\delta Y}  [Y
+ \delta Y]. Since these energy eigenstates increase in energy by Y dx, all
such energy eigenstates that are in the interval ranging from E â Y dx to E
move from below E to above E. There are
          N  Y    ( E )  =     &#x03A9;  Y    ( E )    &#x03B4; E    Y d x
      {\displaystyle N_{Y}\left(E\right)={\frac {\Omega _{Y}\left(E\right)}
      {\delta E}}Ydx\,}  [N_{Y}\left(E\right)=\frac{\Omega_{Y}\left(E\right)}
      {\delta E} Y dx\,]
such energy eigenstates. If     Y d x &#x2264; &#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle
Ydx\leq \delta E}  [Y dx\leq\delta E], all these energy eigenstates will move
into the range between     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] and     E + &#x03B4; E
{\displaystyle E+\delta E}  [E+\delta E] and contribute to an increase in
&#x03A9;   {\displaystyle \Omega }  [\Omega ]. The number of energy eigenstates
that move from below     E + &#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle E+\delta E}  [E+\delta
E] to above     E + &#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle E+\delta E}  [E+\delta E] is
given by      N  Y    (  E + &#x03B4; E  )    {\displaystyle N_{Y}\left
(E+\delta E\right)}  [N_{Y}\left(E+\delta E\right)]. The difference
          N  Y    ( E )  &#x2212;  N  Y    (  E + &#x03B4; E  )
      {\displaystyle N_{Y}\left(E\right)-N_{Y}\left(E+\delta E\right)\,}  [N_
      {Y}\left(E\right) - N_{Y}\left(E+\delta E\right)\,]
is thus the net contribution to the increase in     &#x03A9;   {\displaystyle
\Omega }  [\Omega ]. Note that if Y dx is larger than     &#x03B4; E
{\displaystyle \delta E}  [\delta E] there will be the energy eigenstates that
move from below E to above     E + &#x03B4; E   {\displaystyle E+\delta E}
[E+\delta E]. They are counted in both      N  Y    ( E )    {\displaystyle N_
{Y}\left(E\right)}  [N_{Y}\left(E\right)] and      N  Y    (  E + &#x03B4; E  )
{\displaystyle N_{Y}\left(E+\delta E\right)}  [N_{Y}\left(E+\delta E\right)],
therefore the above expression is also valid in that case.
Expressing the above expression as a derivative with respect to E and summing
over Y yields the expression:
           (    &#x2202; &#x03A9;   &#x2202; x    )   E   = &#x2212;  &#x2211;
      Y   Y   (    &#x2202;  &#x03A9;  Y     &#x2202; E    )   x   =
      (    &#x2202;  (  &#x03A9; X  )    &#x2202; E    )   x
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \Omega }{\partial x}}\right)_{E}=-
      \sum _{Y}Y\left({\frac {\partial \Omega _{Y}}{\partial E}}\right)_
      {x}=\left({\frac {\partial \left(\Omega X\right)}{\partial E}}\right)_
      {x}\,}  [\left(\frac{\partial\Omega}{\partial x}\right)_{E} = -\sum_
      {Y}Y\left(\frac{\partial\Omega_{Y}}{\partial E}\right)_{x}= \left(\frac
      {\partial\left(\Omega X\right)}{\partial E}\right)_{x}\,]
The logarithmic derivative of     &#x03A9;   {\displaystyle \Omega }  [\Omega ]
with respect to x is thus given by:
           (    &#x2202; ln &#x2061;  ( &#x03A9; )    &#x2202; x    )   E   =
      &#x03B2; X +   (    &#x2202; X   &#x2202; E    )   x      {\displaystyle
      \left({\frac {\partial \ln \left(\Omega \right)}{\partial x}}\right)_
      {E}=\beta X+\left({\frac {\partial X}{\partial E}}\right)_{x}\,}  [\left
      (\frac{\partial\ln\left(\Omega\right)}{\partial x}\right)_{E} = \beta X
      +\left(\frac{\partial X}{\partial E}\right)_{x}\,]
The first term is intensive, i.e. it does not scale with system size. In
contrast, the last term scales as the inverse system size and will thus
vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We have thus found that:
           (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; x    )   E   =   X T      {\displaystyle
      \left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial x}}\right)_{E}={\frac {X}{T}}\,}
      [\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial x}\right)_{E} = \frac{X}{T}\,]
Combining this with
           (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; E    )   x   =   1 T      {\displaystyle
      \left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial E}}\right)_{x}={\frac {1}{T}}\,}
      [\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial E}\right)_{x} = \frac{1}{T}\,]
Gives:
         d S =   (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; E    )   x   d E +   (    &#x2202;
      S   &#x2202; x    )   E   d x =    d E  T   +   X T   d x =    &#x03B4; Q
      T      {\displaystyle dS=\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial E}}\right)_
      {x}dE+\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial x}}\right)_{E}dx={\frac {dE}
      {T}}+{\frac {X}{T}}dx={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}\,}  [dS = \left(\frac
      {\partial S}{\partial E}\right)_{x}dE+\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial
      x}\right)_{E}dx = \frac{dE}{T} + \frac{X}{T} dx=\frac{\delta Q}{T}\,]
**** Derivation for systems described by the canonical ensemble[edit] ****
If a system is in thermal contact with a heat bath at some temperature T then,
in equilibrium, the probability distribution over the energy eigenvalues are
given by the canonical_ensemble:
          P  j   =    exp &#x2061;  (  &#x2212;    E  j     k   B    T     )
      Z     {\displaystyle P_{j}={\frac {\exp \left(-{\frac {E_{j}}{k_{\mathrm
      {B} }T}}\right)}{Z}}}  [P_{j}=\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E_{j}}{k_{\mathrm B}
      T}\right)}{Z}]
Here Z is a factor that normalizes the sum of all the probabilities to 1, this
function is known as the partition_function. We now consider an infinitesimal
reversible change in the temperature and in the external parameters on which
the energy levels depend. It follows from the general formula for the entropy:
         S = &#x2212;  k   B     &#x2211;  j    P  j   ln &#x2061;  (  P  j   )
      {\displaystyle S=-k_{\mathrm {B} }\sum _{j}P_{j}\ln \left(P_{j}\right)}
      [S = -k_{\mathrm B}\sum_{j}P_{j}\ln\left(P_{j}\right)]
that
         d S = &#x2212;  k   B     &#x2211;  j   ln &#x2061;  (  P  j   )  d  P
      j     {\displaystyle dS=-k_{\mathrm {B} }\sum _{j}\ln \left(P_
      {j}\right)dP_{j}}  [dS = -k_{\mathrm B}\sum_{j}\ln\left(P_{j}\right)dP_
      {j}]
Inserting the formula for      P  j     {\displaystyle P_{j}}  [P_{j}] for the
canonical ensemble in here gives:
         d S =   1 T    &#x2211;  j    E  j   d  P  j   =   1 T    &#x2211;  j
      d  (   E  j    P  j    )  &#x2212;   1 T    &#x2211;  j    P  j   d  E  j
      =    d E + &#x03B4; W  T   =    &#x03B4; Q  T     {\displaystyle dS=
      {\frac {1}{T}}\sum _{j}E_{j}dP_{j}={\frac {1}{T}}\sum _{j}d\left(E_{j}P_
      {j}\right)-{\frac {1}{T}}\sum _{j}P_{j}dE_{j}={\frac {dE+\delta W}{T}}=
      {\frac {\delta Q}{T}}}  [dS = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{j}E_{j}dP_{j}=\frac{1}
      {T}\sum_{j}d\left(E_{j}P_{j}\right) - \frac{1}{T}\sum_{j}P_{j}dE_{j}=
      \frac{dE + \delta W}{T}=\frac{\delta Q}{T}]
***** Living organisms[edit] *****
There are two principal ways of formulating thermodynamics, (a) through
passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another, and (b)
through cyclic processes, by which the system is left unchanged, while the
total entropy of the surroundings is increased. These two ways help to
understand the processes of life. This topic is mostly beyond the scope of this
present article, but has been considered by several authors, such as Erwin
SchrÃ¶dinger, LÃ©on_Brillouin[65] and Isaac_Asimov. It is also the topic of
current[when?] research.[citation_needed]
To a fair approximation, living organisms may be considered as examples of (b).
Approximately, an animal's physical state cycles by the day, leaving the animal
nearly unchanged. Animals take in food, water, and oxygen, and, as a result of
metabolism, give out breakdown products and heat. Plants take_in_radiative
energy from the sun, which may be regarded as heat, and carbon dioxide and
water. They give out oxygen. In this way they grow. Eventually they die, and
their remains rot away, turning mostly back into carbon dioxide and water. This
can be regarded as a cyclic process. Overall, the sunlight is from a high
temperature source, the sun, and its energy is passed to a lower temperature
sink, i.e. radiated into space. This is an increase of entropy of the
surroundings of the plant. Thus animals and plants obey the second law of
thermodynamics, considered in terms of cyclic processes. Simple concepts of
efficiency of heat engines are hardly applicable to this problem because they
assume closed systems.
From the thermodynamic viewpoint that considers (a), passages from one
equilibrium state to another, only a roughly approximate picture appears,
because living organisms are never in states of thermodynamic equilibrium.
Living organisms must often be considered as open systems, because they take in
nutrients and give out waste products. Thermodynamics of open systems is
currently often considered in terms of passages from one state of thermodynamic
equilibrium to another, or in terms of flows in the approximation of local
thermodynamic equilibrium. The problem for living organisms may be further
simplified by the approximation of assuming a steady state with unchanging
flows. General principles of entropy production for such approximations are
subject to unsettled_current_debate_or_research. Nevertheless, ideas derived
from this viewpoint on the second law of thermodynamics are enlightening about
living creatures.
***** Gravitational systems[edit] *****
In systems that do not require for their descriptions the general theory of
relativity, bodies always have positive heat_capacity, meaning that the
temperature rises with energy. Therefore, when energy flows from a high-
temperature object to a low-temperature object, the source temperature is
decreased while the sink temperature is increased; hence temperature
differences tend to diminish over time. This is not always the case for systems
in which the gravitational force is important and the general theory of
relativity is required. Such systems can spontaneously change towards uneven
spread of mass and energy. This applies to the universe in large scale, and
consequently it may be difficult or impossible to apply the second law to it.
[66] Beyond this, the thermodynamics of systems described by the general theory
of relativity is beyond the scope of the present article.
***** Non-equilibrium states[edit] *****
Main article: Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics
The theory of classical or equilibrium_thermodynamics is idealized. A main
postulate or assumption, often not even explicitly stated, is the existence of
systems in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium. In general,
a region of space containing a physical system at a given time, that may be
found in nature, is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, read in the most
stringent terms. In looser terms, nothing in the entire universe is or has ever
been truly in exact thermodynamic equilibrium.[66][67]
For purposes of physical analysis, it is often enough convenient to make an
assumption of thermodynamic_equilibrium. Such an assumption may rely on trial
and error for its justification. If the assumption is justified, it can often
be very valuable and useful because it makes available the theory of
thermodynamics. Elements of the equilibrium assumption are that a system is
observed to be unchanging over an indefinitely long time, and that there are so
many particles in a system, that its particulate nature can be entirely
ignored. Under such an equilibrium assumption, in general, there are no
macroscopically detectable fluctuations. There is an exception, the case of
critical_states, which exhibit to the naked eye the phenomenon of critical
opalescence. For laboratory studies of critical states, exceptionally long
observation times are needed.
In all cases, the assumption of thermodynamic_equilibrium, once made, implies
as a consequence that no putative candidate "fluctuation" alters the entropy of
the system.
It can easily happen that a physical system exhibits internal macroscopic
changes that are fast enough to invalidate the assumption of the constancy of
the entropy. Or that a physical system has so few particles that the
particulate nature is manifest in observable fluctuations. Then the assumption
of thermodynamic equilibrium is to be abandoned. There is no unqualified
general definition of entropy for non-equilibrium states.[68]
There are intermediate cases, in which the assumption of local thermodynamic
equilibrium is a very good approximation,[69][70][71][72] but strictly speaking
it is still an approximation, not theoretically ideal. For non-equilibrium
situations in general, it may be useful to consider statistical mechanical
definitions of other quantities that may be conveniently called 'entropy', but
they should not be confused or conflated with thermodynamic entropy properly
defined for the second law. These other quantities indeed belong to statistical
mechanics, not to thermodynamics, the primary realm of the second law.
Even though the applicability of the second law of thermodynamics is limited
for non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing such systems are still being
discussed. One of the guiding principles for systems which are far from
equilibrium is the maximum entropy production principle.[73][74] It states that
a system away from equilibrium evolves in such a way as to maximize entropy
production, given present constraints.[75]
The physics of macroscopically observable fluctuations is beyond the scope of
this article.
***** Arrow of time[edit] *****
Further information: Entropy_(arrow_of_time)
Thermodynamic Asymmetry in Time
See also: Arrow_of_time
The second law of thermodynamics is a physical law that is not symmetric to
reversal of the time direction. This does not conflict with notions that have
been observed of the fundamental laws of physics, namely CPT_symmetry, since
the second law applies statistically, it is hypothesized, on time-asymmetric
boundary conditions.[76]
The second law has been proposed to supply a partial explanation of the
difference between moving forward and backwards in time, such as why the cause
precedes the effect (the_causal_arrow_of_time).[77]
***** Irreversibility[edit] *****
Irreversibility in thermodynamic_processes is a consequence of the asymmetric
character of thermodynamic operations, and not of any internally irreversible
microscopic properties of the bodies. Thermodynamic operations are macroscopic
external interventions imposed on the participating bodies, not derived from
their internal properties. There are reputed "paradoxes" that arise from
failure to recognize this.
**** Loschmidt's paradox[edit] ****
Main article: Loschmidt's_paradox
Loschmidt's_paradox, also known as the reversibility paradox, is the objection
that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from the time-
symmetric dynamics that describe the microscopic evolution of a macroscopic
system.
In the opinion of SchrÃ¶dinger, "It is now quite obvious in what manner you
have to reformulate the law of entropy – or for that matter, all other
irreversible statements – so that they be capable of being derived from
reversible models. You must not speak of one isolated system but at least of
two, which you may for the moment consider isolated from the rest of the world,
but not always from each other."[78] The two systems are isolated from each
other by the wall, until it is removed by the thermodynamic operation, as
envisaged by the law. The thermodynamic operation is externally imposed, not
subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical laws that govern the
constituents of the systems. It is the cause of the irreversibility. The
statement of the law in this present article complies with SchrÃ¶dinger's
advice. The causeâeffect relation is logically prior to the second law, not
derived from it.
**** PoincarÃ© recurrence theorem[edit] ****
Main article: PoincarÃ©_recurrence_theorem
The PoincarÃ©_recurrence_theorem considers a theoretical microscopic
description of an isolated physical system. This may be considered as a model
of a thermodynamic system after a thermodynamic operation has removed an
internal wall. The system will, after a sufficiently long time, return to a
microscopically defined state very close to the initial one. The PoincarÃ©
recurrence time is the length of time elapsed until the return. It is
exceedingly long, likely longer than the life of the universe, and depends
sensitively on the geometry of the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic
operation. The recurrence theorem may be perceived as apparently contradicting
the second law of thermodynamics. More obviously, however, it is simply a
microscopic model of thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system formed by
removal of a wall between two systems. For a typical thermodynamical system,
the recurrence time is so large (many many times longer than the lifetime of
the universe) that, for all practical purposes, one cannot observe the
recurrence. One might wish, nevertheless, to imagine that one could wait for
the PoincarÃ© recurrence, and then re-insert the wall that was removed by the
thermodynamic operation. It is then evident that the appearance of
irreversibility is due to the utter unpredictability of the PoincarÃ©
recurrence given only that the initial state was one of thermodynamic
equilibrium, as is the case in macroscopic thermodynamics. Even if one could
wait for it, one has no practical possibility of picking the right instant at
which to re-insert the wall. The PoincarÃ© recurrence theorem provides a
solution to Loschmidt's paradox. If an isolated thermodynamic system could be
monitored over increasingly many multiples of the average PoincarÃ© recurrence
time, the thermodynamic behavior of the system would become invariant under
time reversal.

Main article: Maxwell's_demon
James_Clerk_Maxwell imagined one container divided into two parts, A and B.
Both parts are filled with the same gas at equal temperatures and placed next
to each other, separated by a wall. Observing the molecules on both sides, an
imaginary demon guards a microscopic trapdoor in the wall. When a faster-than-
average molecule from A flies towards the trapdoor, the demon opens it, and the
molecule will fly from A to B. The average speed of the molecules in B will
have increased while in A they will have slowed down on average. Since average
molecular speed corresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in A and
increases in B, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.
One response to this question was suggested in 1929 by LeÃ³_SzilÃ¡rd and later
by LÃ©on_Brillouin. SzilÃ¡rd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell's demon would
need to have some means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of
acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy.
Maxwell's 'demon' repeatedly alters the permeability of the wall between A and
B. It is therefore performing thermodynamic_operations on a microscopic scale,
not just observing ordinary spontaneous or natural macroscopic thermodynamic
processes.

 Wikiquote has quotations related to: Second_law_of_thermodynamics
     The law that entropy always increases holds, I think, the supreme
     position among the laws_of_Nature. If someone points out to you that
     your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell's
     equations â then so much the worse for Maxwell's equations. If it
     is found to be contradicted by observation â well, these
     experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is
     found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you
     no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest
     humiliation.
     â Sir Arthur_Stanley_Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World
     (1927)
     There have been nearly as many formulations of the second law as
     there have been discussions of it.
     â Philosopher / Physicist P.W._Bridgman, (1941)
     Clausius is the author of the sibyllic utterance, "The energy of the
     universe is constant; the entropy of the universe tends to a
     maximum." The objectives of continuum thermomechanics stop far short
     of explaining the "universe", but within that theory we may easily
     derive an explicit statement in some ways reminiscent of Clausius,
     but referring only to a modest object: an isolated body of finite
     size.
