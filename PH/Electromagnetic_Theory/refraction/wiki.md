For the property of metals, see refraction_(metallurgy).
Not to be confused with diffraction, the transmission and bending of waves
around an obstacle.
A ray of light being refracted in a plastic block.
In physics, refraction is the change in direction of a wave passing from one
medium to another or from a gradual change in the medium.[1] Refraction of
light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but other waves such as sound
waves and water_waves also experience refraction. How much a wave is refracted
is determined by the change in wave speed and the initial direction of wave
propagation relative to the direction of change in speed.
For light, refraction follows Snell's_law, which states that, for a given pair
of media, the ratio of the sines of the angle_of_incidence Î¸1 and angle_of
refraction Î¸2 is equal to the ratio of phase_velocities (v1 / v2) in the two
media, or equivalently, to the indices_of_refraction (n2 / n1) of the two
media.[2]
            sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1     sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  2      =    v
      1    v  2     =    n  2    n  1       {\displaystyle {\frac {\sin \theta
      _{1}}{\sin \theta _{2}}}={\frac {v_{1}}{v_{2}}}={\frac {n_{2}}{n_{1}}}}
      [\frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}]
Refraction of light at the interface between two media of different refractive
indices, with n2 > n1. Since the phase velocity is lower in the second medium
(v2 < v1), the angle of refraction Î¸2 is less than the angle of incidence Î¸1;
that is, the ray in the higher-index medium is closer to the normal.
Optical prisms and lenses use refraction to redirect light, as does the human
eye. The refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength of light,[3]
and thus the angle of the refraction also varies correspondingly. This is
called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide white light into its
constituent spectral colors.[4]

***** General explanation *****
When a wave moves into a slower medium the wavefronts get compressed. For the
wavefronts to stay connected at the boundary the wave must change direction.
Consider a wave going from one material to another where its speed is slower as
in the figure. If it reaches the interface between the materials at an angle
one side of the wave will reach the second material first, and therefore slow
down earlier. With one side of the wave going slower the whole wave will pivot
towards that side. This is why a wave will bend away from the surface or toward
the normal when going into a slower material. In the opposite case of a wave
reaching a material where the speed is higher, one side of the wave will speed
up and the wave will pivot away from that side.
Another way of understanding the same thing is to consider the change in
wavelength at the interface. When the wave goes from one material to another
where the wave has a different speed v, the frequency f of the wave will stay
the same, but the distance between wavefronts or wavelength Î»=v/f will change.
If the speed is decreased, such as in the figure to the right, the wavelength
will also decrease. With an angle between the wave fronts and the interface and
change in distance between the wave fronts the angle must change over the
interface to keep the wave fronts intact. From these considerations the
relationship between the angle_of_incidence Î¸1, angle of transmission Î¸2 and
the wave speeds v1 and v2 in the two materials can be derived. This is the law
of_refraction or Snell's law and can be written as[5]
            sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1     sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  2      =    v
      1    v  2       {\displaystyle {\frac {\sin \theta _{1}}{\sin \theta _
      {2}}}={\frac {v_{1}}{v_{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin \theta _{1}}
      {\sin \theta _{2}}}={\frac {v_{1}}{v_{2}}}}].
The phenomenon of refraction can in a more fundamental way be derived from the
2 or 3-dimensional wave_equation. The boundary condition at the interface will
then require the tangential component of the wave_vector to be identical on the
two sides of the interface.[6] Since the magnitude of the wave vector depend on
the wave speed this requires a change in direction of the wave vector.
The relevant wave speed in the discussion above is the phase_velocity of the
wave. This is typically close to the group_velocity which can be seen as the
truer speed of a wave, but when they differ it is important to use the phase
velocity in all calculations relating to refraction.
A wave traveling perpendicular to a boundary, i.e. having its wavefronts
parallel to the boundary, will not change direction even if the speed of the
wave changes.
***** Light *****
A pen partially submerged in a bowl of water appears bent due to refraction at
the water surface.
Refraction of light can be seen in many places in our everyday life. It makes
objects under a water surface appear closer than they really are. It is what
optical_lenses are based on, allowing for instruments such as glasses, cameras,
binoculars, microscopes, and the human_eye. Refraction is also responsible for
some natural optical phenomena including rainbows and mirages.
**** Law of refraction ****
For light, the refractive_index n of a material is more often used than the
wave phase speed v in the material. They are, however, directly related through
the speed_of_light in vacuum c as
         n =   c v     {\displaystyle n={\frac {c}{v}}}  [{\displaystyle n=
      {\frac {c}{v}}}].
In optics, therefore, the law of refraction is typically written as
          n  1   sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1   =  n  2   sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;
      2     {\displaystyle n_{1}\sin \theta _{1}=n_{2}\sin \theta _{2}}  [
      {\displaystyle n_{1}\sin \theta _{1}=n_{2}\sin \theta _{2}}].
**** Refraction in a water surface ****
A pencil part immersed in water looks bent due to refraction: the light waves
from X change direction and so seem to originate at Y.
Refraction occurs when light goes through a water surface since water has a
refractive index of 1.33 and air has a refractive index of about 1. Looking at
a straight object, such as a pencil in the figure here, which is placed at a
slant, partially in the water, the object appears to bend at the water's
surface. This is due to the bending of light rays as they move from the water
to the air. Once the rays reach the eye, the eye traces them back as straight
lines (lines of sight). The lines of sight (shown as dashed lines) intersect at
a higher position than where the actual rays originated. This causes the pencil
to appear higher and the water to appear shallower than it really is.
The depth that the water appears to be when viewed from above is known as the
apparent depth. This is an important consideration for spearfishing from the
surface because it will make the target fish appear to be in a different place,
and the fisher must aim lower to catch the fish. Conversely, an object above
the water has a higher apparent height when viewed from below the water. The
opposite correction must be made by an archer_fish.[7]
For small angles of incidence (measured from the normal, when sin Î¸ is
approximately the same as tan Î¸), the ratio of apparent to real depth is the
ratio of the refractive indexes of air to that of water. But, as the angle of
incidence approaches 90o, the apparent depth approaches zero, albeit reflection
increases, which limits observation at high angles of incidence. Conversely,
the apparent height approaches infinity as the angle of incidence (from below)
increases, but even earlier, as the angle of total_internal_reflection is
approached, albeit the image also fades from view as this limit is approached.
An image of the Golden_Gate_Bridge is refracted and bent by many differing
three-dimensional drops of water.
**** Dispersion ****
Refraction is also responsible for rainbows and for the splitting of white
light into a rainbow-spectrum as it passes through a glass prism. Glass has a
higher refractive index than air. When a beam of white light passes from air
into a material having an index of refraction that varies with frequency, a
phenomenon known as dispersion occurs, in which different coloured components
of the white light are refracted at different angles, i.e., they bend by
different amounts at the interface, so that they become separated. The
different colors correspond to different frequencies.
**** Atmospheric refraction ****
Main article: atmospheric_refraction
The sun appears slightly flattened when close to the horizon due to refraction
in the atmosphere.
The refractive index of air depends on the air density and thus vary with air
temperature and pressure. Since the pressure is lower at higher altitudes, the
refractive index is also lower, causing light rays to refract towards the earth
surface when traveling long distances through the atmosphere. This shifts the
apparent positions of stars slightly when they are close to the horizon and
makes the sun visible before it geometrically rises above the horizon during a
sunrise.
Heat_haze in the engine exhaust above a diesel locomotive.
Temperature variations in the air can also cause refraction of light. This can
be seen as a heat_haze when hot and cold air is mixed e.g. over a fire, in
engine exhaust, or when opening a window on a cold day. This makes objects
viewed through the mixed air appear to shimmer or move around randomly as the
hot and cold air moves. This effect is also visible from normal variations in
air temperature during a sunny day when using high magnification telephoto
lenses and is often limiting the image quality in these cases. [8] In a similar
way, atmospheric turbulence gives rapidly varying distortions in the images of
astronomical telescopes limiting the resolution of terrestrial telescopes not
using adaptive_optics or other techniques for overcoming these atmospheric
distortions.
Mirage over a hot road.
Air temperature variations close to the surface can give rise to other optical
phenomena, such as mirages and Fata_Morgana. Most commonly, air heated by a hot
road on a sunny day deflects light approaching at a shallow angle towards a
viewer. This makes the road appear reflecting, giving an illusion of water
covering the road.
***** Water waves *****
Main article: Water_wave_refraction
Water waves are almost parallel to the beach when they hit it because they
gradually refract towards land as the water get shallower.
Water_waves travel slower in shallower water. This can be used to demonstrate
refraction in ripple_tanks and also explains why waves on a shoreline tend to
strike the shore close to a perpendicular angle. As the waves travel from deep
water into shallower water near the shore, they are refracted from their
original direction of travel to an angle more normal to the shoreline.[9]
***** Clinical significance *****
In medicine, particularly optometry, ophthalmology and orthoptics, refraction
(also known as refractometry) is a clinical test in which a phoropter may be
used by the appropriate eye_care_professional to determine the eye's refractive
error and the best corrective_lenses to be prescribed. A series of test lenses
in graded optical_powers or focal_lengths are presented to determine which
provides the sharpest, clearest vision.[10]
***** Acoustics *****
Main article: Refraction_(sound)
In underwater_acoustics, refraction is the bending or curving of a sound ray
that results when the ray passes through a sound_speed_gradient from a region
of one sound speed to a region of a different speed. The amount of ray bending
is dependent on the amount of difference between sound speeds, that is, the
variation in temperature, salinity, and pressure of the water.[11] Similar
acoustics effects are also found in the Earth's_atmosphere. The phenomenon of
refraction_of_sound in the atmosphere has been known for centuries;[12]
however, beginning in the early 1970s, widespread analysis of this effect came
into vogue through the designing of urban highways and noise_barriers to
address the meteorological effects of bending of sound rays in the lower
atmosphere.[13]

      boundary conditions which the incoming and the transmitted wave need to
      fulfill at the boundary between the two media. Essentially, the
      tangential components of the wave vectors need to be identical, as
      otherwise the phase difference between the waves at the boundary would be
      position-dependent, and the wavefronts could not be continuous. As the
      magnitude of the wave vector depends on the refractive index of the
      medium, the said condition can in general only be fulfilled with
      different propagation directions.
