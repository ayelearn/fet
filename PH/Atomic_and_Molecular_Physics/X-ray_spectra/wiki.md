***** Characteristic X-ray spectroscopy[edit] *****
When an electron from the inner shell of an atom is excited by the energy of a
photon, it moves to a higher energy level. When it returns to the low energy
level, the energy which it previously gained by the excitation is emitted as a
photon which has a wavelength that is characteristic for the element (there
could be several characteristic wavelengths per element). Analysis of the X-ray
emission_spectrum produces qualitative results about the elemental composition
of the specimen. Comparison of the specimen's spectrum with the spectra of
samples of known composition produces quantitative results (after some
mathematical corrections for absorption, fluorescence and atomic number). Atoms
can be excited by a high-energy beam of charged particles such as electrons (in
an electron_microscope for example), protons (see PIXE) or a beam of X-rays
(see X-ray_fluorescence, or XRF or also recently in transmission XRT). These
methods enable elements from the entire periodic table to be analysed, with the
exception of H, He and Li. In electron_microscopy an electron beam excites X-
rays; there are two main techniques for analysis of spectra of characteristic
X-ray radiation: energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy (EDS) and wavelength
dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy (WDS). In X-Ray Transmission (XRT), the
equivalent atomic composition (Zeff) is captured based on photo electric and
Compton effects.
**** Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy[edit] ****
In an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, a semiconductor detector measures
energy of incoming photons. To maintain detector integrity and resolution it
should be cooled with liquid nitrogen or by Peltier cooling. EDS is widely
employed in electron_microscopes (where not spectroscopy but imaging is a main
task) and in cheaper and/or portable XRF units.
**** Wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy[edit] ****
In a wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, a single_crystal diffracts the
photons according to Bragg's_law, which are then collected by a detector. By
moving the diffraction crystal and detector relative to each other, a wide
region of the spectrum can be observed. To observe a large spectral range,
three of four different single crystals may be needed. In contrast to EDS, WDS
is a method of sequential spectrum acquisition. While WDS is slower than EDS
and more sensitive to positioning specimen in the spectrometer, it has superior
spectral resolution and sensitivity. WDS is widely used in microprobes (where
X-ray microanalysis is the main task) and in XRF; it is widely used in the
field of x ray diffraction to calculate various data such as interplanar
spacing and wavelength of the incident x ray using Bragg's law.
***** X-ray emission spectroscopy[edit] *****
The father-and-son scientific team of William_Lawrence_Bragg and William_Henry
Bragg, who were 1915 Nobel Prize Winners, were the original pioneers in
developing X-ray emission spectroscopy. Jointly they measured the X-ray
wavelengths of many elements to high precision, using high-energy electrons as
excitation source. The cathode_ray_tube or an x-ray_tube[2] was the method used
to pass electrons through a crystal of numerous elements. They also
painstakingly produced numerous diamond-ruled glass diffraction_gratings for
their spectrometers. The law of diffraction of a crystal is called Bragg's_law
in their honor.
Intense and wavelength-tunable X-rays are now typically generated with
synchrotrons. In a material, the X-rays may suffer an energy loss compared to
the incoming beam. This energy loss of the re-emerging beam reflects an
internal excitation of the atomic system, an X-ray analogue to the well-known
Raman_spectroscopy that is widely used in the optical region.
In the X-ray region there is sufficient energy to probe changes in the
electronic state (transitions between orbitals; this is in contrast with the
optical region, where the energy loss is often due to changes in the state of
the rotational or vibrational degrees of freedom). For instance, in the ultra
soft_X-ray region (below about 1 keV), crystal_field_excitations give rise to
the energy loss.
The photon-in-photon-out process may be thought of as a scattering event. When
the x-ray energy corresponds to the binding_energy of a core-level electron,
this scattering_process is resonantly enhanced by many orders of magnitude.
This type of X-ray emission spectroscopy is often referred to as resonant
inelastic_X-ray_scattering (RIXS).
Due to the wide separation of orbital energies of the core levels, it is
possible to select a certain atom of interest. The small spatial extent of core
level orbitals forces the RIXS process to reflect the electronic structure in
close vicinity of the chosen atom. Thus, RIXS experiments give valuable
information about the local electronic structure of complex systems, and
theoretical calculations are relatively simple to perform.
**** Instrumentation[edit] ****
There exist several efficient designs for analyzing an X-ray emission spectrum
in the ultra soft X-ray region. The figure of merit for such instruments is the
spectral throughput, i.e. the product of detected intensity and spectral
resolving power. Usually, it is possible to change these parameters within a
certain range while keeping their product constant...
*** Grating spectrometers[edit] ***
Usually X-ray diffraction in spectrometers is achieved on crystals, but in
Grating spectrometers, the X-rays emerging from a sample must pass a source-
defining slit, then optical elements (mirrors and/or gratings) disperse them by
diffraction according to their wavelength and, finally, a detector is placed at
their focal points.
*** Spherical grating mounts[edit] ***
Henry_Augustus_Rowland (1848â1901) devised an instrument that allowed the use
of a single optical element that combines diffraction and focusing: a spherical
grating. Reflectivity of X-rays is low, regardless of the used material and
therefore, grazing incidence upon the grating is necessary. X-ray beams
impinging on a smooth surface at a few degrees glancing_angle of incidence
undergo external_total_reflection which is taken advantage of to enhance the
instrumental efficiency substantially.
Denoted by R the radius of a spherical grating. Imagine a circle with half the
radius R tangent to the center of the grating surface. This small circle is
called the Rowland circle. If the entrance slit is anywhere on this circle,
then a beam passing the slit and striking the grating will be split into a
specularly_reflected beam, and beams of all diffraction orders, that come into
focus at certain points on the same circle.
*** Plane grating mounts[edit] ***
Similar to optical spectrometers, a plane grating spectrometer first needs
optics that turns the divergent rays emitted by the x-ray source into a
parallel beam. This may be achieved by using a parabolic mirror. The parallel
rays emerging from this mirror strike a plane grating (with constant groove
distance) at the same angle and are diffracted according to their wavelength. A
second parabolic mirror then collects the diffracted rays at a certain angle
and creates an image on a detector. A spectrum within a certain wavelength
range can be recorded simultaneously by using a two-dimensional position-
sensitive detector such as a microchannel photomultiplier plate or an X-ray
sensitive CCD chip (film plates are also possible to use).
*** Interferometers[edit] ***
Instead of using the concept of multiple beam interference that gratings
produce, the two rays may simply interfere. By recording the intensity of two
such co-linearly at some fixed point and changing their relative phase one
obtains an intensity spectrum as a function of path length difference. One can
show that this is equivalent to a Fourier transformed spectrum as a function of
frequency. The highest recordable frequency of such a spectrum is dependent on
the minimum step size chosen in the scan and the frequency resolution (i.e. how
well a certain wave can be defined in terms of its frequency) depends on the
maximum path length difference achieved. The latter feature allows a much more
compact design for achieving high resolution than for a grating spectrometer
because x-ray wavelengths are small compared to attainable path length
differences.
*** Early history of X-ray spectroscopy in the U.S.[edit] ***
Philips Gloeilampen Fabrieken, headquartered in Eindhoven in the Netherlands,
got its start as a manufacturer of light bulbs, but quickly evolved until it is
now one of the leading manufacturers of electrical apparatus, electronics, and
related products including X-ray equipment. It also has had one of the world's
largest R&D labs. In 1940, the Netherlands was overrun by Hitlerâs Germany.
The company was able to transfer a substantial sum of money to a company that
it set up as an R&D laboratory in an estate in Irvington on the Hudson in NY.
As an extension to their work on light bulbs, the Dutch company had developed a
line of X-ray tubes for medical applications that were powered by transformers.
These X-ray tubes could also be used in scientific X-ray instrumentations, but
there was very little commercial demand for the latter. As a result, management
decided to try to develop this market and they set up development groups in
their research labs in both Holland and the U.S.
They hired Dr. Ira Duffendack, a professor at University of Michigan and a
world expert on infrared research to head the lab and to hire a staff. In 1951
he hired Dr. David Miller as Assistant Director of Research. Dr. Miller had
done research on X-ray instrumentation at Washington University in St. Louis.
Dr. Duffendack also hired Dr. Bill Parish, a well known researcher in X-ray
diffraction, to head up the section of the lab on X-ray instrumental
development. X-ray diffraction units were widely used in academic research
departments to do crystal analysis. An essential component of a diffraction
unit was a very accurate angle measuring device known as a goniometer. Such
units were not commercially available, so each investigator had do try to make
their own. Dr Parrish decided this would be a good device to use to generate an
instrumental market, so his group designed and learned how to manufacture a
goniometer. This market developed quickly and, with the readily available tubes
and power supplies, a complete diffraction unit was made available and was
successfully marketed.
The U.S. management did not want the laboratory to be converted to a
manufacturing unit so it decided to set up a commercial unit to further develop
the X-ray instrumentation market. In 1953 Norelco Electronics was established
in Mount Vernon, NY, dedicated to the sale and support of X-ray
instrumentation. It included a sales staff, a manufacturing group, an
engineering department and an applications lab. Dr. Miller was transferred from
the lab to head up the engineering department. The sales staff sponsored three
schools a year, one in Mount Vernon, one in Denver, and one in San Francisco.
The week-long school curricula reviewed the basics of X-ray instrumentation and
the specific application of Norelco products. The faculty were members of the
engineering department and academic consultants. The schools were well attended
by academic and industrial R&D scientists. The engineering department was also
a new product development group. It added an X-ray spectrograph to the product
line very quickly and contributed other related products for the next 8 years.
The applications lab was an essential sales tool. When the spectrograph was
introduced as a quick and accurate analytical chemistry device, it met with
widespread skepticism. All research facilities had a chemistry department and
analytical analysis was done by âwet chemistryâ methods. The idea of doing
this analysis by physics instrumentation was considered suspect. To overcome
this bias, the salesman would ask a prospective customer for a task the
customer was doing by âwet methodsâ. The task would be given to the
applications lab and they would demonstrate how accurately and quickly it could
be done using the X-ray units. This proved to be a very strong sales tool,
particularly when the results were published in the Norelco Reporter, a
technical journal issued monthly by the company with wide distribution to
commercial and academic institutions.
An X-ray spectrograph consists of a high voltage power supply (50 kV or
100 kV), a broad band X-ray tube, usually with a tungsten anode and a beryllium
window, a specimen holder, an analyzing crystal, a goniometer, and an X-ray
detector device. These are arranged as shown in Fig. 1.
    * Fig. 1
The continuous X-spectrum emitted from the tube irradiates the specimen and
excites the characteristic spectral X-ray lines in the specimen. Each of the 92
elements emits a characteristic spectrum. Unlike the optical spectrum, the X-
ray spectrum is quite simple. The strongest line, usually the Kalpha line, but
sometimes the Lalpha line, suffices to identify the element. The existence of a
particular line betrays the existence of an element, and the intensity is
proportional to the amount of the particular element in the specimen. The
characteristic lines are reflected from a crystal, the analyzer, under an angle
that is given by the Bragg condition. The crystal samples all the diffraction
angles theta by rotation, while the detector rotates over the corresponding
angle 2-theta. With a sensitive detector, the X-ray photons are counted
individually. By stepping the detectors along the angle, and leaving it in
position for a known time, the number of counts at each angular position gives
the line intensity. These counts may be plotted on a curve by an appropriate
display unit. The characteristic X-rays come out at specific angles, and since
the angular position for every X-ray spectral line is known and recorded, it is
easy to find the sample's composition.
A chart for a scan of a Molybdenum specimen is shown in Fig. 2. The tall peak
on the left side is the characteristic alpha line at a two theta of 12 degrees.
Second and third order lines also appear.
    * Fig. 2
Since the alpha line is often the only line of interest in many industrial
applications, the final device in the Norelco X- ray spectrographic instrument
line was the Autrometer. This device could be programmed to automatically read
at any desired two theta angle for any desired time interval.
Soon after the Autrometer was introduced, Philips decided to stop marketing X-
ray instruments developed in both the U.S. and Europe and settled on offering
only the Eindhoven line of instruments.
In 1961, during the development of the Autrometer, Norelco was given a sub-
contract from the Jet Propulsion Lab. The Lab was working on the instrument
package for the Surveyor spaceship. The composition of the moonâs surface was
of major interest and the use of an X-ray detection instrument was viewed as a
possible solution. Working with a power limit of 30 watts was very challenging,
but a device was delivered but it wasnât used. Later NASA developments did
lead to an X-ray spectrographic unit that did make the desired moon soil
analysis.
The Norelco efforts faded but the use of X-ray spectroscopy in units known as
XRF instruments continued to grow. With a boost from NASA, units were finally
reduced to handheld size and are seeing widespread use. Units are available
from Bruker, Thermo Scientific, Elvatech Ltd. and SPECTRA.
In recent years, major advances took place at the University of Washington at
the hands of Dr. Oliver R. Hoidn who came up with a disposable x-ray camera
based on mass produced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors and
single-board computers. The outcome of this innovation was published in 2015 in
the Review of Scientific Instruments.
