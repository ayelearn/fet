Sequential is an American synthesizer company founded in 1974 as Sequential
Circuits by Dave_Smith. In 1978, Sequential released the Prophet-5, the first
programmable polyphonic synthesizer, used by artists including Michael_Jackson,
Madonna, and John_Carpenter. Sequential was also pivotal to the development of
MIDI in 1982, which synchronizes electronic instruments by different
manufacturers.
In 1987, Sequential went out of business and was purchased by Yamaha. Smith
continued to develop instruments through a new company, Dave Smith Instruments.
In 2015, Yamaha sold the Prophet and Sequential Circuits brands to Dave Smith
Instruments, which rebranded as Sequential in 2018.

***** History[edit] *****
**** 1974 â1980: Founding and first Prophets[edit] ****
Engineer Dave_Smith founded Sequential Circuits in San Francisco in 1974.[1]
The first Sequential Circuits product was an analog sequencer for use with Moog
and ARP synthesizers, followed by a digital sequencer and the Model 700
Programmer, which allowed for programming on Minimoog and ARP 2600.[1] The
Model 800, launched in 1975 , was controlled and programmed with a
microprocessor.[2]
The Prophet-5 (1978), the first Sequential synthesizer
At the same time, Smith had a full-time job working with microprocessors, then
a new technology, and conceived the idea of combining them with synthesizer
chips to create a programmable synthesizer. In early 1977, he quit his job to
work full-time on a design for the Prophet-5, a programmable polyphonic
synthesizer. He demonstrated it at NAMM in January 1978 and shipped the first
models later that year.[1] Unlike its nearest competitor, the Yamaha_CS-80, the
Prophet-5 had patch memory, allowing users to store sounds rather than having
to reprogram them manually.[3]
The Prophet-5 became a market leader and industry standard.[3] It has been used
by pop and hip hop musicians such as Michael_Jackson, Madonna, and Dr_Dre, and
by film composers such as John_Carpenter.[3] It was followed by the larger
Prophet-10, which was less successful as it was notorious for unreliability.[4]
The smaller Pro-One, essentially a monophonic Prophet 5,[5] saw more success.

**** 1981â1982: MIDI[edit] ****
Main article: MIDI
Prophet 600 (1982), the first Sequential Circuits synthesizer with MIDI
functionality
In 1981, Roland founder Ikutaro_Kakehashi contacted Smith about creating a
standardized means of synchronizing electronic instruments manufactured by
different companies.[6] Smith and Sequential engineer Chet Wood designed an
interface using Roland's Digital_Control_Bus (DCB) as a basis.[7] This standard
was discussed and modified by representatives of Roland, Yamaha, Korg, and
Kawai.[8][9]:20 The protocol was named Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface_
(MIDI)[10]:4 and unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith, who received Technical_Grammy
Awards in 2013 for their work.[11][12][13] In 1982, Sequential released the
Prophet 600, one of the first MIDI-equipped synthesizers.
**** 1987: Closure[edit] ****
In 1987, Sequential Circuits went out of business. Smith blamed the decision to
move to computer audio in 1985: "We were too small and under-capitalized, and
we were a few years too early in the market ... It drained our resources, so by
the time we pulled back to professional instruments, it was too late."[1]
Sequential Circuits was purchased by Yamaha, who shut it down in 1989. Smith
moved to Korg, where he worked mainly on the Wavestation synthesizer.[1]
**** 2002 â2014: Dave Smith Instruments[edit] ****
After several years working on software_synthesis, in 2002 Smith opened a new
company, Dave Smith Instruments (DSI), to build new hardware. Its first product
was the Evolver synthesizer in 2002.[1] In 2008, DSI launched the Prophet_'08,
conceived as an affordable analog eight-voice synthesizer.[1]
**** 2015 âpresent: return to Prophet and Sequential[edit] ****
Sequential Prophet-6 (2015)
In January 2015, Yamaha returned the Sequential Circuits and Prophet brands to
Smith in a goodwill gesture. This was at the encouragement of Roland founder
Ikutaro_Kakehashi, who had worked with Smith to create MIDI. Kakehashi said: "I
feel that itâs important to get rid of unnecessary conflict among electronic
musical instrument companies. That is exactly the spirit of MIDI. For this
reason, I personally recommended that the President of Yamaha, Mr. Nakata,
return the rights to the Sequential name to Dave Smith."[14]
In 2015, Smith announced the Prophet-6, described as a spiritual successor to
the Prophet-5.[15] In May 2018, Sequential announced the Prophet-X, featuring
both sample playback and digitally controlled oscillators.[16] On August 31,
2018, the 40th anniversary of the Prophet-5, Dave Smith Instruments rebranded
as Sequential.[17]
