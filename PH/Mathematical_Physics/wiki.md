Application of mathematical methods to problems in physics
An example of mathematical physics: solutions of SchrÃ¶dinger's_equation for
quantum_harmonic_oscillators (left) with their amplitudes (right).
Mathematical physics refers to the development of mathematical methods for
application to problems in physics. The Journal_of_Mathematical_Physics defines
the field as "the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the
development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the
formulation of physical theories".[1] It is a branch of applied_mathematics,
but deals with physical problems.

***** Scope[edit] *****
There are several distinct branches of mathematical physics, and these roughly
correspond to particular historical periods.
**** Classical mechanics[edit] ****
Main articles: Lagrangian_mechanics and Hamiltonian_mechanics
The rigorous, abstract and advanced reformulation of Newtonian mechanics
adopting the Lagrangian_mechanics and the Hamiltonian_mechanics even in the
presence of constraints. Both formulations are embodied in analytical
mechanics. It leads, for instance, to discover the deep interplay of the notion
of symmetry[clarification_needed] and that of conserved quantities during the
dynamical evolution[clarification_needed], stated within the most elementary
formulation of Noether's_theorem. These approaches and ideas can be, and in
fact have been, extended to other areas of physics as statistical_mechanics,
continuum_mechanics, classical_field_theory and quantum_field_theory. Moreover,
they have provided several examples and basic ideas in differential_geometry
(e.g. the theory of vector_bundles and several notions in symplectic_geometry).
**** Partial differential equations[edit] ****
Main article: Partial_differential_equations
The theory of partial_differential_equations (and the related areas of
variational_calculus, Fourier_analysis, potential_theory, and vector_analysis)
are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics. These were
developed intensively from the second half of the 18th century (by, for
example, D'Alembert, Euler, and Lagrange) until the 1930s. Physical
applications of these developments include hydrodynamics, celestial_mechanics,
continuum_mechanics, elasticity_theory, acoustics, thermodynamics, electricity,
magnetism, and aerodynamics.
**** Quantum theory[edit] ****
Main article: Quantum_mechanics
The theory of atomic_spectra (and, later, quantum_mechanics) developed almost
concurrently with the mathematical fields of linear_algebra, the spectral
theory of operators, operator_algebras and more broadly, functional_analysis.
Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes SchrÃ¶dinger operators, and it has
connections to atomic_and_molecular_physics. Quantum_information theory is
another subspecialty.
**** Relativity and quantum relativistic theories[edit] ****
Main articles: Theory_of_relativity and Quantum_field_theory
The special and general theories of relativity require a rather different type
of mathematics. This was group_theory, which played an important role in both
quantum field theory and differential_geometry. This was, however, gradually
supplemented by topology and functional_analysis in the mathematical
description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena. In this
area both homological_algebra and category_theory are important nowadays.
**** Statistical mechanics[edit] ****
Main article: Statistical_mechanics
Statistical_mechanics forms a separate field, which includes the theory of
phase_transitions. It relies upon the Hamiltonian_mechanics (or its quantum
version) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic_theory
and some parts of probability_theory. There are increasing interactions between
combinatorics_and_physics, in particular statistical physics.
***** Usage[edit] *****
[Mathematical_Physics_and_other_sciences.png]
The usage of the term "mathematical physics" is sometimes idiosyncratic.
Certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of
physics are not, in fact, considered parts of mathematical physics, while other
closely related fields are. For example, ordinary_differential_equations and
symplectic_geometry are generally viewed as purely mathematical disciplines,
whereas dynamical_systems and Hamiltonian_mechanics belong to mathematical
physics. John_Herapath used the term for the title of his 1847 text on
"mathematical principles of natural philosophy"; the scope at that time being
"the causes of heat, gaseous elasticity, gravitation, and other great phenomena
of nature".[2]
**** Mathematical vs. theoretical physics[edit] ****
The term "mathematical physics" is sometimes used to denote research aimed at
studying and solving problems inspired by physics or thought_experiments within
a mathematically rigorous framework. In this sense, mathematical physics covers
a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of pure
mathematics and physics. Although related to theoretical_physics,[3]
mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the
same type as found in mathematics.
On the other hand, theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and
experimental_physics, which often requires theoretical physicists (and
mathematical physicists in the more general sense) to use heuristic, intuitive,
and approximate arguments.[4] Such arguments are not considered rigorous by
mathematicians, but that is changing over time.
Such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical theories.
Because of the required level of mathematical rigour, these researchers often
deal with questions that theoretical physicists have considered to be already
solved. However, they can sometimes show (but neither commonly nor easily) that
the previous solution was incomplete, incorrect, or simply too naÃ¯ve. Issues
about attempts to infer the second law of thermodynamics from statistical
mechanics are examples. Other examples concern the subtleties involved with
synchronisation procedures in special and general relativity (Sagnac_effect and
Einstein_synchronisation).
The effort to put physical theories on a mathematically rigorous footing has
inspired many mathematical developments. For example, the development of
quantum mechanics and some aspects of functional_analysis parallel each other
in many ways. The mathematical study of quantum mechanics, quantum field
theory, and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results in operator
algebras. The attempt to construct a rigorous quantum field theory has also
brought about progress in fields such as representation_theory. Use of geometry
and topology plays an important role in string_theory.
***** Prominent mathematical physicists[edit] *****
**** Before Newton[edit] ****
The roots of mathematical physics can be traced back to the likes of Archimedes
in Greece, Ptolemy in Egypt, Alhazen in Iraq, and Al-Biruni in Persia.
In the first decade of the 16th century, amateur astronomer Nicolaus_Copernicus
proposed heliocentrism, and published a treatise on it in 1543. He retained the
Ptolemaic idea of epicycles, and merely sought to simplify astronomy by
constructing simpler sets of epicyclic orbits. Epicycles consist of circles
upon circles. According to Aristotelian_physics, the circle was the perfect
form of motion, and was the intrinsic motion of Aristotle's fifth_elementâthe
quintessence or universal essence known in Greek as aether for the English pure
airâthat was the pure substance beyond the sublunary_sphere, and thus was
celestial entities' pure composition. The German Johannes_Kepler [1571â1630],
Tycho_Brahe's assistant, modified Copernican orbits to ellipses, formalized in
the equations of Kepler's laws_of_planetary_motion.
An enthusiastic atomist, Galileo_Galilei in his 1623 book The Assayer asserted
that the "book of nature" is written in mathematics.[5] His 1632 book, about
his telescopic observations, supported heliocentrism.[6] Having introduced
experimentation, Galileo then refuted geocentric cosmology by refuting
Aristotelian physics itself. Galilei's 1638 book Discourse on Two New Sciences
established the law of equal free fall as well as the principles of inertial
motion, founding the central concepts of what would become today's classical
mechanics.[6] By the Galilean law_of_inertia as well as the principle of
Galilean_invariance, also called Galilean relativity, for any object
experiencing inertia, there is empirical justification for knowing only that it
is at relative rest or relative motionârest or motion with respect to another
object.
RenÃ©_Descartes adopted Galilean principles and developed a complete system of
heliocentric cosmology, anchored on the principle of vortex motion, Cartesian
physics, whose widespread acceptance brought the demise of Aristotelian
physics. Descartes sought to formalize mathematical reasoning in science, and
developed Cartesian_coordinates for geometrically plotting locations in 3D
space and marking their progressions along the flow of time.[7]
Christiaan_Huygens was the first to use mathematical formulas to describe the
laws of physics, and for that reason Huygens is regarded as the first
theoretical_physicist and the founder of mathematical physics.[8][9]
**** Newtonian and post Newtonian[edit] ****
Isaac_Newton (1642â1727) developed new mathematics, including calculus and
several numerical_methods such as Newton's_method to solve problems in physics.
Newton's theory of motion, published in 1687, modeled three Galilean laws of
motion along with Newton's law_of_universal_gravitation on a framework of
absolute_spaceâhypothesized by Newton as a physically real entity of
Euclidean geometric structure extending infinitely in all directionsâwhile
presuming absolute_time, supposedly justifying knowledge of absolute motion,
the object's motion with respect to absolute space. The principle of Galilean
invariance/relativity was merely implicit in Newton's theory of motion. Having
ostensibly reduced the Keplerian celestial laws of motion as well as Galilean
terrestrial laws of motion to a unifying force, Newton achieved great
mathematical rigor, but with theoretical laxity.[10]
In the 18th century, the Swiss Daniel_Bernoulli (1700â1782) made
contributions to fluid_dynamics, and vibrating_strings. The Swiss Leonhard
Euler (1707â1783) did special work in variational_calculus, dynamics, fluid
dynamics, and other areas. Also notable was the Italian-born Frenchman, Joseph-
Louis_Lagrange (1736â1813) for work in analytical_mechanics: he formulated
Lagrangian_mechanics) and variational methods. A major contribution to the
formulation of Analytical Dynamics called Hamiltonian_dynamics was also made by
the Irish physicist, astronomer and mathematician, William_Rowan_Hamilton
(1805-1865). Hamiltonian dynamics had played an important role in the
formulation of modern theories in physics, including field theory and quantum
mechanics. The French mathematical physicist Joseph_Fourier (1768 â 1830)
introduced the notion of Fourier_series to solve the heat_equation, giving rise
to a new approach to solving partial differential equations by means of
integral_transforms.
Into the early 19th century, the French Pierre-Simon_Laplace (1749â1827) made
paramount contributions to mathematical astronomy, potential_theory, and
probability_theory. SimÃ©on_Denis_Poisson (1781â1840) worked in analytical
mechanics and potential theory. In Germany, Carl_Friedrich_Gauss (1777â1855)
made key contributions to the theoretical foundations of electricity,
magnetism, mechanics, and fluid_dynamics. In England, George_Green (1793-1841)
published An_Essay_on_the_Application_of_Mathematical_Analysis_to_the_Theories
of_Electricity_and_Magnetism in 1828, which in addition to its significant
contributions to mathematics made early progress towards laying down the
mathematical foundations of electricity and magnetism.
A couple of decades ahead of Newton's publication of a particle theory of
light, the Dutch Christiaan_Huygens (1629â1695) developed the wave theory of
light, published in 1690. By 1804, Thomas_Young's double-slit experiment
revealed an interference pattern, as though light were a wave, and thus
Huygens's wave theory of light, as well as Huygens's inference that light waves
were vibrations of the luminiferous_aether, was accepted. Jean-Augustin_Fresnel
modeled hypothetical behavior of the aether. Michael_Faraday introduced the
theoretical concept of a fieldânot action at a distance. Mid-19th century,
the Scottish James_Clerk_Maxwell (1831â1879) reduced electricity and
magnetism to Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory, whittled down by others to
the four Maxwell's_equations. Initially, optics was found consequent of
[clarification_needed] Maxwell's field. Later, radiation and then today's known
electromagnetic_spectrum were found also consequent of[clarification_needed]
this electromagnetic field.
The English physicist Lord_Rayleigh [1842â1919] worked on sound. The Irishmen
William_Rowan_Hamilton (1805â1865), George_Gabriel_Stokes (1819â1903) and
Lord_Kelvin (1824â1907) produced several major works: Stokes was a leader in
optics and fluid dynamics; Kelvin made substantial discoveries in
thermodynamics; Hamilton did notable work on analytical_mechanics, discovering
a new and powerful approach nowadays known as Hamiltonian_mechanics. Very
relevant contributions to this approach are due to his German colleague Carl
Gustav_Jacobi (1804â1851) in particular referring to canonical
transformations. The German Hermann_von_Helmholtz (1821â1894) made
substantial contributions in the fields of electromagnetism, waves, fluids, and
sound. In the United States, the pioneering work of Josiah_Willard_Gibbs
(1839â1903) became the basis for statistical_mechanics. Fundamental
theoretical results in this area were achieved by the German Ludwig_Boltzmann
(1844-1906). Together, these individuals laid the foundations of
electromagnetic theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics.
**** Relativistic[edit] ****
By the 1880s, there was a prominent paradox that an observer within Maxwell's
electromagnetic field measured it at approximately constant speed, regardless
of the observer's speed relative to other objects within the electromagnetic
field. Thus, although the observer's speed was continually lost[clarification
needed] relative to the electromagnetic field, it was preserved relative to
other objects in the electromagnetic field. And yet no violation of Galilean
invariance within physical interactions among objects was detected. As
Maxwell's electromagnetic field was modeled as oscillations of the aether,
physicists inferred that motion within the aether resulted in aether_drift,
shifting the electromagnetic field, explaining the observer's missing speed
relative to it. The Galilean_transformation had been the mathematical process
used to translate the positions in one reference frame to predictions of
positions in another reference frame, all plotted on Cartesian_coordinates, but
this process was replaced by Lorentz_transformation, modeled by the Dutch
Hendrik_Lorentz [1853â1928].
In 1887, experimentalists Michelson and Morley failed to detect aether drift,
however. It was hypothesized that motion into the aether prompted aether's
shortening, too, as modeled in the Lorentz_contraction. It was hypothesized
that the aether thus kept Maxwell's electromagnetic field aligned with the
principle of Galilean invariance across all inertial_frames_of_reference, while
Newton's theory of motion was spared.
In the 19th century, Gauss's contributions to non-Euclidean_geometry, or
geometry on curved surfaces, laid the groundwork for the subsequent development
of Riemannian_geometry by Bernhard_Riemann (1826â1866). Austrian theoretical
physicist and philosopher Ernst_Mach criticized Newton's postulated absolute
space. Mathematician Jules-Henri_PoincarÃ© (1854â1912) questioned even
absolute time. In 1905, Pierre_Duhem published a devastating criticism of the
foundation of Newton's theory of motion.[10] Also in 1905, Albert_Einstein
(1879â1955) published his special_theory_of_relativity, newly explaining both
the electromagnetic field's invariance and Galilean invariance by discarding
all hypotheses concerning aether, including the existence of aether itself.
Refuting the framework of Newton's theoryâabsolute_space_and_absolute
timeâspecial relativity refers to relative space and relative time, whereby
length contracts and time dilates along the travel pathway of an object.
In 1908, Einstein's former professor Hermann_Minkowski modeled 3D space
together with the 1D axis of time by treating the temporal axis like a fourth
spatial dimensionâaltogether 4D spacetimeâand declared the imminent demise
of the separation of space and time. Einstein initially called this
"superfluous learnedness", but later used Minkowski_spacetime with great
elegance in his general_theory_of_relativity,[11] extending invariance to all
reference framesâwhether perceived as inertial or as acceleratedâand
credited this to Minkowski, by then deceased. General relativity replaces
Cartesian coordinates with Gaussian_coordinates, and replaces Newton's claimed
empty yet Euclidean space traversed instantly by Newton's vector of
hypothetical gravitational forceâan instant action_at_a_distanceâwith a
gravitational field. The gravitational field is Minkowski spacetime itself, the
4D topology of Einstein aether modeled on a Lorentzian_manifold that "curves"
geometrically, according to the Riemann_curvature_tensor, in the vicinity of
either mass or energy. (Under special relativityâa special case of general
relativityâeven massless energy exerts gravitational effect by its mass
equivalence locally "curving" the geometry of the four, unified dimensions of
space and time.)
**** Quantum[edit] ****
Another revolutionary development of the 20th century was quantum_theory, which
emerged from the seminal contributions of Max_Planck (1856â1947) (on black
body_radiation) and Einstein's work on the photoelectric_effect. This was, at
first, followed by a heuristic framework devised by Arnold_Sommerfeld
(1868â1951) and Niels_Bohr (1885â1962), but this was soon replaced by the
quantum_mechanics developed by Max_Born (1882â1970), Werner_Heisenberg
(1901â1976), Paul_Dirac (1902â1984), Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger (1887â1961),
Satyendra_Nath_Bose (1894â1974), and Wolfgang_Pauli (1900â1958). This
revolutionary theoretical framework is based on a probabilistic interpretation
of states, and evolution and measurements in terms of self-adjoint_operators on
an infinite dimensional vector space. That is called Hilbert_space, introduced
in its elementary form by David_Hilbert (1862â1943) and Frigyes_Riesz (1880-
1956), and rigorously defined within the axiomatic modern version by John_von
Neumann in his celebrated book Mathematical_Foundations_of_Quantum_Mechanics,
where he built up a relevant part of modern functional analysis on Hilbert
spaces, the spectral_theory in particular. Paul Dirac used algebraic
constructions to produce a relativistic model for the electron, predicting its
magnetic_moment and the existence of its antiparticle, the positron.
