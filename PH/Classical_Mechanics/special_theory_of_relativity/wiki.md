In physics, special relativity (also known as the special theory of relativity)
is the generally accepted and experimentally confirmed physical_theory
regarding the relationship between space_and_time. In Albert_Einstein's
original pedagogical treatment, it is based on two postulates:
   1. the laws of physics are invariant (i.e. identical) in all inertial_frames
      of_reference (i.e. non-accelerating frames of reference); and
   2. the speed_of_light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless
      of the motion of the light source or observer.
Some of the work of Albert Einstein in special relativity is built on the
earlier work by Hendrik_Lorentz.
Special relativity was originally proposed by Albert Einstein in a paper
published on 26 September 1905 titled "On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving
Bodies".[p_1] The inconsistency of Newtonian_mechanics with Maxwell's_equations
of electromagnetism and, experimentally, the Michelson-Morley null result (and
subsequent similar experiments) demonstrated that the historically hypothesized
luminiferous_aether did not exist. This led to Einstein's development of
special relativity, which corrects mechanics to handle situations involving all
motions and especially those at a speed close to that of light (known as
relativistic velocities). Today, special relativity is proven to be the most
accurate model of motion at any speed when gravitational effects are
negligible. Even so, the Newtonian model is still valid as a simple and
accurate approximation at low velocities (relative to the speed of light), for
example, the everyday motions on Earth.
Special relativity has a wide range of consequences. These have been
experimentally verified,[1] and include length_contraction, time_dilation,
relativistic_mass, massâenergy_equivalence, a_universal_speed_limit, the
speed of causality and relativity_of_simultaneity. It has, for example,
replaced the conventional notion of an absolute universal time with the notion
of a time that is dependent on reference frame and spatial position. Rather
than an invariant time interval between two events, there is an invariant
spacetime_interval. Combined with other laws of physics, the two postulates of
special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy, as expressed in
the massâenergy_equivalence formula E = mc2 (c is the speed_of_light in a
vacuum).[2][3]
A defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the Galilean
transformations of Newtonian mechanics with the Lorentz_transformations. Time
and space cannot be defined separately from each other (as was earlier thought
to be the case). Rather, space and time are interwoven into a_single_continuum
known_as_"spacetime". Events that occur at the same time for one observer can
occur at different times for another.
Until Einstein developed general_relativity, introducing a curved spacetime to
incorporate gravity, the phrase "special relativity" was not used. A
translation sometimes used is "restricted relativity"; "special" really means
"special case".[p_2][p_3][p_4][note_1]
The theory is "special" in that it only applies in the special_case where the
spacetime is "flat", i.e., the curvature_of_spacetime, described by the energy-
momentum_tensor and causing gravity, is negligible.[4][note_2] In order to
correctly accommodate gravity, Einstein formulated general relativity in 1915.
Special relativity, contrary to some historical descriptions, does accommodate
accelerations as well as accelerating_frames_of_reference.[5][6]
Just as Galilean_relativity is now accepted to be an approximation of special
relativity that is valid for low speeds, special relativity is considered an
approximation of general relativity that is valid for weak gravitational
fields, i.e. at a sufficiently small scale (for example, for tidal_forces) and
in conditions of free_fall. General relativity, however, incorporates
noneuclidean_geometry in order to represent gravitational effects as the
geometric curvature of spacetime. Special relativity is restricted to the flat
spacetime known as Minkowski_space. As long as the universe can be modeled as a
pseudo-Riemannian_manifold, a Lorentz-invariant frame that abides by special
relativity can be defined for a sufficiently small neighborhood of each point
in this curved_spacetime.
Galileo_Galilei had already postulated that there is no absolute and well-
defined state of rest (no privileged_reference_frames), a principle now called
Galileo's_principle_of_relativity. Einstein extended this principle so that it
accounted for the constant speed of light,[7] a phenomenon that had been
observed in the MichelsonâMorley_experiment. He also postulated that it holds
for all the laws_of_physics, including both the laws of mechanics and of
electrodynamics.[8]
Albert_Einstein around 1905, the year his "Annus_Mirabilis_papers" were
published. These included Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter KÃ¶rper, the paper
founding special relativity.

***** Traditional "two postulates" approach to special relativity[edit] *****
    Reflections of this type made it clear to me as long ago as shortly
    after 1900, i.e., shortly after Planck's trailblazing work, that
    neither mechanics nor electrodynamics could (except in limiting cases)
    claim exact validity. Gradually I despaired of the possibility of
âdiscovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on    â
    known facts. The longer and the more desperately I tried, the more I
    came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal
    principle could lead us to assured results... How, then, could such a
    universal principle be found?
â Albert Einstein: Autobiographical Notes[p_5]
Einstein discerned two fundamental propositions that seemed to be the most
assured, regardless of the exact validity of the (then) known laws of either
mechanics or electrodynamics. These propositions were the constancy of the
speed of light in a vacuum and the independence of physical laws (especially
the constancy of the speed of light) from the choice of inertial system. In his
initial presentation of special relativity in 1905 he expressed these
postulates as:[p_1]
    * The Principle of Relativity â the laws by which the states of physical
      systems undergo change are not affected, whether these changes of state
      be referred to the one or the other of two systems in uniform translatory
      motion relative to each other.[p_1]
    * The Principle of Invariant Light Speed â "... light is always
      propagated in empty space with a definite velocity [speed] c which is
      independent of the state of motion of the emitting body" (from the
      preface).[p_1] That is, light in vacuum propagates with the speed c (a
      fixed constant, independent of direction) in at least one system of
      inertial coordinates (the "stationary system"), regardless of the state
      of motion of the light source.
The constancy of the speed of light was motivated by Maxwell's_theory_of
electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous_ether. There is
conflicting evidence on the extent to which Einstein was influenced by the null
result of the MichelsonâMorley_experiment.[9][10] In any case, the null
result of the MichelsonâMorley experiment helped the notion of the constancy
of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.
The derivation of special relativity depends not only on these two explicit
postulates, but also on several tacit assumptions (made_in_almost_all_theories
of_physics), including the isotropy and homogeneity of space and the
independence of measuring rods and clocks from their past history.[p_6]
Following Einstein's original presentation of special relativity in 1905, many
different sets of postulates have been proposed in various alternative
derivations.[11] However, the most common set of postulates remains those
employed by Einstein in his original paper. A more mathematical statement of
the Principle of Relativity made later by Einstein, which introduces the
concept of simplicity not mentioned above is:
     Special principle of relativity: If a system of coordinates K is
     chosen so that, in relation to it, physical laws hold good in their
     simplest form, the same laws hold good in relation to any other
     system of coordinates K' moving in uniform translation relatively to
     K.[12]
Henri_PoincarÃ© provided the mathematical framework for relativity theory by
proving that Lorentz_transformations are a subset of his PoincarÃ©_group of
symmetry transformations. Einstein later derived these transformations from his
axioms.
Many of Einstein's papers present derivations of the Lorentz transformation
based upon these two principles.[p_7]
***** Principle of relativity[edit] *****
Main article: Principle_of_relativity
**** Reference frames and relative motion[edit] ****
Figure 2-1. The primed system is in motion relative to the unprimed system with
constant velocity v only along the x-axis, from the perspective of an observer
stationary in the unprimed system. By the principle_of_relativity, an observer
stationary in the primed system will view a likewise construction except that
the velocity they record will be âv. The changing of the speed of propagation
of interaction from infinite in non-relativistic mechanics to a finite value
will require a modification of the transformation equations mapping events in
one frame to another.
Reference_frames play a crucial role in relativity theory. The term reference
frame as used here is an observational perspective in space which is not
undergoing any change in motion (acceleration), from which a position can be
measured along 3 spatial axes (so, at rest or constant velocity). In addition,
a reference frame has the ability to determine measurements of the time of
events using a 'clock' (any reference device with uniform periodicity).
An event is an occurrence that can be assigned a single unique moment and
location in space relative to a reference frame: it is a "point" in spacetime.
Since the speed of light is constant in relativity irrespective of reference
frame, pulses of light can be used to unambiguously measure distances and refer
back the times that events occurred to the clock, even though light takes time
to reach the clock after the event has transpired.
For example, the explosion of a firecracker may be considered to be an "event".
We can completely specify an event by its four spacetime coordinates: The time
of occurrence and its 3-dimensional spatial location define a reference point.
Let's call this reference frame S.
In relativity theory, we often want to calculate the coordinates of an event
from differing reference frames. The equations that relate measurements made in
different frames are called transformation equations.
**** Standard configuration[edit] ****
To gain insight in how the spacetime coordinates measured by observers in
different reference_frames compare with each other, it is useful to work with a
simplified setup with frames in a standard configuration.[13]:107 With care,
this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the
conclusions that are reached. In Fig. 2‑1, two Galilean_reference_frames (i.e.
conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion. Frame S belongs
to a first observer O, and frame Sâ² (pronounced "S prime" or "S dash")
belongs to a second observer Oâ².
    * The x, y, z axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective
      primed axes of frame Sâ².
    * Frame Sâ² moves, for simplicity, in a single direction: the x-direction
      of frame S with a constant velocity v as measured in frame S.
    * The origins of frames S and Sâ² are coincident when time t = 0 for frame
      S and tâ² = 0 for frame Sâ².
Since there is no absolute reference frame in relativity theory, a concept of
'moving' doesn't strictly exist, as everything may be moving with respect to
some other reference frame. Instead, any two frames that move at the same speed
in the same direction are said to be comoving. Therefore, S and Sâ² are not
comoving.
**** Lack of an absolute reference frame[edit] ****
The principle_of_relativity, which states that physical laws have the same form
in each inertial_reference_frame, dates back to Galileo, and was incorporated
into Newtonian physics. However, in the late 19th century, the existence of
electromagnetic_waves led some physicists to suggest that the universe was
filled with a substance that they called "aether", which, they postulated,
would act as the medium through which these waves, or vibrations, propagated
(in many respects similar to the way sound propagates through air). The aether
was thought to be an absolute_reference_frame against which all speeds could be
measured, and could be considered fixed and motionless relative to Earth or
some other fixed reference point. The aether supposedly possessed some
wonderful properties: it was sufficiently elastic to support electromagnetic
waves, and those waves could interact with matter, yet it offered no resistance
to bodies passing through it (its one property was that it allowed
electromagnetic waves to propagate). The results of various experiments,
including the MichelsonâMorley_experiment in 1887 (subsequently verified with
more accurate and innovative experiments), led to the theory of special
relativity, by showing that the aether did not exist.[14] Einstein's solution
was to discard the notion of an aether and the absolute state of rest. In
relativity, any reference frame moving with uniform motion will observe the
same laws of physics. In particular, the speed of light in vacuum is always
measured to be c, even when measured by multiple systems that are moving at
different (but constant) velocities.
**** Relativity without the second postulate[edit] ****
From the principle of relativity alone without assuming the constancy of the
speed of light (i.e. using the isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by
the principle of special relativity) it_can_be_shown that the spacetime
transformations between inertial frames are either Euclidean, Galilean, or
Lorentzian. In the Lorentzian case, one can then obtain relativistic interval
conservation and a certain finite limiting speed. Experiments suggest that this
speed is the speed of light in vacuum.[p_8][15]
***** Lorentz invariance as the essential core of special relativity[edit]
*****
Main article: Lorentz_transformation
**** Alternative approaches to special relativity[edit] ****
Main article: Derivations_of_the_Lorentz_transformations
Einstein consistently based the derivation of Lorentz invariance (the essential
core of special relativity) on just the two basic principles of relativity and
light-speed invariance. He wrote:
     The insight fundamental for the special theory of relativity is this:
     The assumptions relativity and light speed invariance are compatible
     if relations of a new type ("Lorentz transformation") are postulated
     for the conversion of coordinates and times of events... The
     universal principle of the special theory of relativity is contained
     in the postulate: The laws of physics are invariant with respect to
     Lorentz transformations (for the transition from one inertial system
     to any other arbitrarily chosen inertial system). This is a
     restricting principle for natural laws...[p_5]
Thus many modern treatments of special relativity base it on the single
postulate of universal Lorentz covariance, or, equivalently, on the single
postulate of Minkowski_spacetime.[p_9][p_10]
Rather than considering universal Lorentz covariance to be a derived principle,
this article considers it to be the fundamental postulate of special
relativity. The traditional two-postulate approach to special relativity is
presented in innumerable college textbooks and popular presentations.[16]
Textbooks starting with the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime include
those by Taylor and Wheeler[17] and by Callahan.[18] This is also the approach
followed by the Wikipedia articles Spacetime and Minkowski_diagram.
**** Lorentz transformation and its inverse[edit] ****
Define an event to have spacetime coordinates (t,x,y,z) in system S and
(tâ²,xâ²,yâ²,zâ²) in a reference frame moving at a velocity v with respect
to that frame, Sâ². Then the Lorentz_transformation specifies that these
coordinates are related in the following way:
              t &#x2032;     = &#x03B3; &#xA0; ( t &#x2212; v x  /   c  2   )
      x &#x2032;     = &#x03B3; &#xA0; ( x &#x2212; v t )      y &#x2032;     =
      y      z &#x2032;     = z ,       {\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}t'&=\gamma \ (t-vx/c^{2})\\x'&=\gamma \ (x-
      vt)\\y'&=y\\z'&=z,\end{aligned}}}  [\begin{align}
      t' &= \gamma \ (t - vx/c^2) \\
      x' &= \gamma \ (x - v t) \\
      y' &= y \\
      z' &= z ,
      \end{align}]
where
         &#x03B3; =   1  1 &#x2212;    v  2    c  2          {\displaystyle
      \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}  [\gamma = \frac
      {1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}]
is the Lorentz_factor and c is the speed_of_light in vacuum, and the velocity v
of Sâ², relative to S, is parallel to the x-axis. For simplicity, the y and z
coordinates are unaffected; only the x and t coordinates are transformed. These
Lorentz transformations form a one-parameter_group of linear_mappings, that
parameter being called rapidity.
Solving the four transformation equations above for the unprimed coordinates
yields the inverse Lorentz transformation:
             t    = &#x03B3; (  t &#x2032;  + v  x &#x2032;   /   c  2   )
      x    = &#x03B3; (  x &#x2032;  + v  t &#x2032;  )     y    =  y &#x2032;
      z    =  z &#x2032;  .       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t&=\gamma
      (t'+vx'/c^{2})\\x&=\gamma (x'+vt')\\y&=y'\\z&=z'.\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t&=\gamma (t'+vx'/c^{2})\\x&=\gamma
      (x'+vt')\\y&=y'\\z&=z'.\end{aligned}}}]
Enforcing this inverse Lorentz transformation to coincide with the Lorentz
transformation from the primed to the unprimed system, shows the unprimed frame
as moving with the velocity vâ² = âv, as measured in the primed frame.
There is nothing special about the x-axis. The transformation can apply to the
y- or z-axis, or indeed in any direction parallel to the motion (which are
warped by the Î³ factor) and perpendicular; see the article Lorentz
transformation for details.
A quantity invariant under Lorentz_transformations is known as a Lorentz
scalar.
Writing the Lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate
differences, where one event has coordinates (x1, t1) and (xâ²1, tâ²1),
another event has coordinates (x2, t2) and (xâ²2, tâ²2), and the differences
are defined as
      Eq. 1:        &#x0394;  x &#x2032;  =  x  2  &#x2032;  &#x2212;  x  1
      &#x2032;  &#xA0; , &#xA0; &#x0394;  t &#x2032;  =  t  2  &#x2032;
      &#x2212;  t  1  &#x2032;  &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle \Delta x'=x'_{2}-x'_
      {1}\ ,\ \Delta t'=t'_{2}-t'_{1}\ .}  [{\displaystyle \Delta x'=x'_{2}-x'_
      {1}\ ,\ \Delta t'=t'_{2}-t'_{1}\ .}]
      Eq. 2:        &#x0394; x =  x  2   &#x2212;  x  1   &#xA0; , &#xA0;
      &#xA0; &#x0394; t =  t  2   &#x2212;  t  1   &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle
      \Delta x=x_{2}-x_{1}\ ,\ \ \Delta t=t_{2}-t_{1}\ .}  [{\displaystyle
      \Delta x=x_{2}-x_{1}\ ,\ \ \Delta t=t_{2}-t_{1}\ .}]
we get
      Eq. 3:        &#x0394;  x &#x2032;  = &#x03B3; &#xA0; ( &#x0394; x
      &#x2212; v  &#x0394; t ) &#xA0; , &#xA0; &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \Delta

      &#x03B3; &#xA0;  (  &#x0394; t &#x2212; v &#xA0; &#x0394; x  /   c  2
      )  &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle \Delta t'=\gamma \ \left(\Delta t-v\ \Delta
      x/c^{2}\right)\ .}  [{\displaystyle \Delta t'=\gamma \ \left(\Delta t-v\
      \Delta x/c^{2}\right)\ .}]
      Eq. 4:        &#x0394; x = &#x03B3; &#xA0; ( &#x0394;  x &#x2032;  + v

**** Graphical representation of the Lorentz transformation[edit] ****
Figure 3-1. Drawing a Minkowski spacetime diagram to illustrate a Lorentz
transformation.
Spacetime diagrams (Minkowski_diagrams) are an extremely useful aid to
visualizing how coordinates transform between different reference frames.
Although it is not as easy to perform exact computations using them as directly
invoking the Lorentz transformations, their main power is their ability to
provide an intuitive grasp of the results of a relativistic scenario.[15]
To draw a spacetime diagram, begin by considering two Galilean reference
frames, S and S', in standard configuration, as shown in Fig. 2‑1.[15][19]:
155â199
Fig. 3‑1a. Draw the     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x] and     t   {\displaystyle
t}  [t] axes of frame S. The     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x] axis is horizontal
and the     t   {\displaystyle t}  [t] (actually     c t   {\displaystyle ct}
[ct]) axis is vertical, which is the opposite of the usual convention in
kinematics. The     c t   {\displaystyle ct}  [ct] axis is scaled by a factor
of     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] so that both axes have common units of
length. In the diagram shown, the gridlines are spaced one unit distance apart.
The 45Â° diagonal lines represent the worldlines of two photons passing through
the origin at time     t = 0.   {\displaystyle t=0.}  [{\displaystyle t=0.}]
The slope of these worldlines is 1 because the photons advance one unit in
space per unit of time. Two events,      A    {\displaystyle {\text{A}}}  [
{\displaystyle {\text{A}}}] and      B  ,   {\displaystyle {\text{B}},}  [
{\displaystyle {\text{B}},}] have been plotted on this graph so that their
coordinates may be compared in the S and S' frames.
Fig. 3‑1b. Draw the      x &#x2032;    {\displaystyle x'}  [x'] and     c  t
&#x2032;    {\displaystyle ct'}  [{\displaystyle ct'}] axes of frame S'. The
c  t &#x2032;    {\displaystyle ct'}  [{\displaystyle ct'}] axis represents the
worldline of the origin of the S' coordinate system as measured in frame S. In
this figure,     v = c  /  2.   {\displaystyle v=c/2.}  [{\displaystyle v=c/
2.}] Both the     c  t &#x2032;    {\displaystyle ct'}  [{\displaystyle ct'}]
and      x &#x2032;    {\displaystyle x'}  [x'] axes are tilted from the
unprimed axes by an angle     &#x03B1; =  tan  &#x2212; 1   &#x2061; ( &#x03B2;
) ,   {\displaystyle \alpha =\tan ^{-1}(\beta ),}  [{\displaystyle \alpha =\tan
^{-1}(\beta ),}] where     &#x03B2; = v  /  c .   {\displaystyle \beta =v/c.}
[{\displaystyle \beta =v/c.}] The primed and unprimed axes share a common
origin because frames S and S' had been set up in standard configuration, so
that     t = 0   {\displaystyle t=0}  [t=0] when      t &#x2032;  = 0.
{\displaystyle t'=0.}  [{\displaystyle t'=0.}]
Fig. 3‑1c. Units in the primed axes have a different scale from units in the
unprimed axes. From the Lorentz transformations, we observe that     (  x
&#x2032;  , c  t &#x2032;  )   {\displaystyle (x',ct')}  [{\displaystyle
(x',ct')}] coordinates of     ( 0 , 1 )   {\displaystyle (0,1)}  [(0,1)] in the
primed coordinate system transform to     ( &#x03B2; &#x03B3; , &#x03B3; )
{\displaystyle (\beta \gamma ,\gamma )}  [{\displaystyle (\beta \gamma ,\gamma
)}] in the unprimed coordinate system. Likewise,     (  x &#x2032;  , c  t
&#x2032;  )   {\displaystyle (x',ct')}  [{\displaystyle (x',ct')}] coordinates
of     ( 1 , 0 )   {\displaystyle (1,0)}  [(1,0)] in the primed coordinate
system transform to     ( &#x03B3; , &#x03B2; &#x03B3; )   {\displaystyle
(\gamma ,\beta \gamma )}  [{\displaystyle (\gamma ,\beta \gamma )}] in the
unprimed system. Draw gridlines parallel with the     c  t &#x2032;
{\displaystyle ct'}  [{\displaystyle ct'}] axis through points     ( k &#x03B3;
, k &#x03B2; &#x03B3; )   {\displaystyle (k\gamma ,k\beta \gamma )}  [
{\displaystyle (k\gamma ,k\beta \gamma )}] as measured in the unprimed frame,
where     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] is an integer. Likewise, draw gridlines
parallel with the      x &#x2032;    {\displaystyle x'}  [x'] axis through
( k &#x03B2; &#x03B3; , k &#x03B3; )   {\displaystyle (k\beta \gamma ,k\gamma
)}  [{\displaystyle (k\beta \gamma ,k\gamma )}] as measured in the unprimed
frame. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we observe that the spacing between     c
t &#x2032;    {\displaystyle ct'}  [{\displaystyle ct'}] units equals       ( 1
+  &#x03B2;  2   )  /  ( 1 &#x2212;  &#x03B2;  2   )     {\displaystyle {\sqrt
{(1+\beta ^{2})/(1-\beta ^{2})}}}  [{\displaystyle {\sqrt {(1+\beta ^{2})/(1-
\beta ^{2})}}}] times the spacing between     c t   {\displaystyle ct}  [ct]
units, as measured in frame S. This ratio is always greater than 1, and
ultimately it approaches infinity as     &#x03B2; &#x2192; 1.   {\displaystyle
\beta \rightarrow 1.}  [{\displaystyle \beta \rightarrow 1.}]
Fig. 3‑1d. Since the speed of light is an invariant, the worldlines of two
photons passing through the origin at time      t &#x2032;  = 0
{\displaystyle t'=0}  [{\displaystyle t'=0}] still plot as 45Â° diagonal lines.
The primed coordinates of      A    {\displaystyle {\text{A}}}  [{\displaystyle
{\text{A}}}] and      B    {\displaystyle {\text{B}}}  [{\displaystyle {\text
{B}}}] are related to the unprimed coordinates through the Lorentz
transformations and could be approximately measured from the graph (assuming
that it has been plotted accurately enough), but the real merit of a Minkowski
diagram is its granting us a geometric view of the scenario. For example, in
this figure, we observe that the two timelike-separated events that had
different x-coordinates in the unprimed frame are now at the same position in
space.
While the unprimed frame is drawn with space and time axes that meet at right
angles, the primed frame is drawn with axes that meet at acute or obtuse
angles. The frames are actually equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable
distortions in how spacetime coordinates map onto a Cartesian_plane. By
analogy, planar maps of the world are unavoidably distorted, but with
experience and intuition, one learns to mentally account for these distortions.
***** Consequences derived from the Lorentz transformation[edit] *****
See also: Twin_paradox and Relativistic_mechanics
The consequences of special relativity can be derived from the Lorentz
transformation equations.[20] These transformations, and hence special
relativity, lead to different physical predictions than those of Newtonian
mechanics at all relative velocities, and most pronounced when relative
velocities become comparable to the speed of light. The speed of light is so
much larger than anything most humans encounter that some of the effects
predicted by relativity are initially counterintuitive.
**** Invariant interval[edit] ****
In Galilean relativity, length (    &#x0394; r   {\displaystyle \Delta r}
[\Delta r])[note_3] and temporal separation between two events (    &#x0394; t
{\displaystyle \Delta t}  [\Delta t]) are independent invariants, the values of
which do not change when observed from different frames of reference.[note_4]
[note_5]
In special relativity, however, the interweaving of spatial and temporal
coordinates generates the concept of an invariant interval, denoted as
&#x0394;  s  2     {\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta s^
{2}}]:
         &#x0394;  s  2      =  d e f      c  2   &#x0394;  t  2   &#x2212;
      ( &#x0394;  x  2   + &#x0394;  y  2   + &#x0394;  z  2   )
      {\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}\;{\overset {def}{=}}\;c^{2}\Delta t^{2}-
      (\Delta x^{2}+\Delta y^{2}+\Delta z^{2})}  [{\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}\;
      {\overset {def}{=}}\;c^{2}\Delta t^{2}-(\Delta x^{2}+\Delta y^{2}+\Delta
      z^{2})}][note_6]
The interweaving of space and time revokes the implicitly assumed concepts of
absolute simultaneity and synchronization across non-comoving frames.
The form of     &#x0394;  s  2   ,   {\displaystyle \Delta s^{2},}  [
{\displaystyle \Delta s^{2},}] being the difference of the squared time lapse
and the squared spatial distance, demonstrates a fundamental discrepancy
between Euclidean and spacetime distances.[note_7] The invariance of this
interval is a property of the general Lorentz transform (also called the
PoincarÃ©_transformation), making it an isometry of spacetime. The general
Lorentz transform extends the standard Lorentz transform (which deals with
translations without rotation, i.e. Lorentz_boosts, in the x-direction) with
all other translations, reflections, and rotations between any Cartesian
inertial frame.[24]:33â34
In the analysis of simplified scenarios, such as spacetime diagrams, a reduced-
dimensionality form of the invariant interval is often employed:
         &#x0394;  s  2    =   c  2   &#x0394;  t  2   &#x2212; &#x0394;  x  2
      {\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}\,=\,c^{2}\Delta t^{2}-\Delta x^{2}}  [
      {\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}\,=\,c^{2}\Delta t^{2}-\Delta x^{2}}]
Demonstrating that the interval is invariant is straightforward for the
reduced-dimensionality case and with frames in standard configuration:[15]
          c  2   &#x0394;  t  2   &#x2212; &#x0394;  x  2     {\displaystyle c^
      {2}\Delta t^{2}-\Delta x^{2}}  [{\displaystyle c^{2}\Delta t^{2}-\Delta
      x^{2}}]     =  c  2    &#x03B3;  2     (  &#x0394;  t &#x2032;  +     v

      (  1 &#x2212;     v  2    c  2       )    {\displaystyle =\gamma ^{2}c^

         =  c  2   &#x0394;  t  &#x2032;   2    &#x2212; &#x0394;  x  &#x2032;

The value of     &#x0394;  s  2     {\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}}  [
{\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}}] is hence independent of the frame in which it is
measured.
In considering the physical significance of     &#x0394;  s  2
{\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}}], there are three
cases to note:[15][25]:25â39
    * Îs2 > 0: In this case, the two events are separated by more time than
      space, and they are hence said to be timelike separated. This implies
      that      |  &#x0394; x  /  &#x0394; t  |  < c ,   {\displaystyle |\Delta
      x/\Delta t|<c,}  [{\displaystyle |\Delta x/\Delta t|<c,}] and given the
      Lorentz transformation     &#x0394;  x &#x2032;  = &#x03B3; &#xA0;
      ( &#x0394; x &#x2212; v  &#x0394; t ) ,   {\displaystyle \Delta x'=\gamma
      \ (\Delta x-v\,\Delta t),}  [{\displaystyle \Delta x'=\gamma \ (\Delta x-
      v\,\Delta t),}] it is evident that there exists a     v   {\displaystyle
      v}  [v] less than     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] for which     &#x0394;
      x &#x2032;  = 0   {\displaystyle \Delta x'=0}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
      x'=0}] (in particular,     v = &#x0394; x  /  &#x0394; t   {\displaystyle
      v=\Delta x/\Delta t}  [{\displaystyle v=\Delta x/\Delta t}]). In other
      words, given two events that are timelike separated, it is possible to
      find a frame in which the two events happen at the same place. In this
      frame, the separation in time,     &#x0394; s  /  c ,   {\displaystyle
      \Delta s/c,}  [{\displaystyle \Delta s/c,}] is called the proper time.
    * Îs2 < 0: In this case, the two events are separated by more space than
      time, and they are hence said to be spacelike separated. This implies
      that      |  &#x0394; x  /  &#x0394; t  |  > c ,   {\displaystyle |\Delta
      x/\Delta t|>c,}  [{\displaystyle |\Delta x/\Delta t|>c,}] and given the
      Lorentz transformation     &#x0394;  t &#x2032;  = &#x03B3; &#xA0;
      ( &#x0394; t &#x2212; v &#x0394; x  /   c  2   ) ,   {\displaystyle
      \Delta t'=\gamma \ (\Delta t-v\Delta x/c^{2}),}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
      t'=\gamma \ (\Delta t-v\Delta x/c^{2}),}] there exists a     v
      {\displaystyle v}  [v] less than     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] for which
      &#x0394;  t &#x2032;  = 0   {\displaystyle \Delta t'=0}  [{\displaystyle
      \Delta t'=0}] (in particular,     v =  c  2   &#x0394; t  /  &#x0394; x
      {\displaystyle v=c^{2}\Delta t/\Delta x}  [{\displaystyle v=c^{2}\Delta
      t/\Delta x}]). In other words, given two events that are spacelike
      separated, it is possible to find a frame in which the two events happen
      at the same time. In this frame, the separation in space,       &#x2212;
      &#x0394;  s  2     ,   {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-\Delta s^{2}}},}  [
      {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-\Delta s^{2}}},}] is called the proper distance,
      or proper length. For values of     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] greater
      than and less than      c  2   &#x0394; t  /  &#x0394; x ,
      {\displaystyle c^{2}\Delta t/\Delta x,}  [{\displaystyle c^{2}\Delta t/
      \Delta x,}] the sign of     &#x0394;  t &#x2032;    {\displaystyle \Delta
      t'}  [\Delta t'] changes, meaning that the temporal order of spacelike-
      separated events changes depending on the frame in which the events are
      viewed. The temporal order of timelike-separated events, however, is
      absolute, since the only way that     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] could be
      greater than      c  2   &#x0394; t  /  &#x0394; x   {\displaystyle c^
      {2}\Delta t/\Delta x}  [{\displaystyle c^{2}\Delta t/\Delta x}] would be
      if     v > c .   {\displaystyle v>c.}  [{\displaystyle v>c.}]
    * Îs2 = 0: In this case, the two events are said to be lightlike
      separated. This implies that      |  &#x0394; x  /  &#x0394; t  |  = c ,
      {\displaystyle |\Delta x/\Delta t|=c,}  [{\displaystyle |\Delta x/\Delta
      t|=c,}] and this relationship is frame independent due to the invariance
      of      s  2   .   {\displaystyle s^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle s^{2}.}] From
      this, we observe that the speed of light is     c   {\displaystyle c}
      [c] in every inertial frame. In other words, starting from the assumption
      of universal Lorentz covariance, the constant speed of light is a derived
      result, rather than a postulate as in the two-postulates formulation of
      the special theory.
**** Relativity of simultaneity[edit] ****
See also: Relativity_of_simultaneity and Ladder_paradox
Figure 4-1. The three events (A, B, C) are simultaneous in the reference frame
of some observer O. In a reference frame moving at v = 0.3c, as measured by O,
the events occur in the order C, B, A. In a reference frame moving at v = -0.5c
with respect to O, the events occur in the order A, B, C. The white lines, the
lines of simultaneity, move from the past to the future in the respective
frames (green coordinate axes), highlighting events residing on it. They are
the locus of all events occurring at the same time in the respective frame. The
gray area is the light cone with respect to the origin of all considered
frames.
Consider two events happening in two different locations that occur
simultaneously in the reference frame of one inertial observer. They may occur
non-simultaneously in the reference frame of another inertial observer (lack of
absolute_simultaneity).
From Equation 3 (the forward Lorentz transformation in terms of coordinate
differences)
         &#x0394;  t &#x2032;  = &#x03B3;  (  &#x0394; t &#x2212;    v
      &#x0394; x   c  2      )    {\displaystyle \Delta t'=\gamma \left(\Delta
      t-{\frac {v\,\Delta x}{c^{2}}}\right)}  [\Delta t' = \gamma \left(\Delta
      t - \frac{v \,\Delta x}{c^{2}} \right)]
It is clear that the two events that are simultaneous in frame S (satisfying
Ît = 0), are not necessarily simultaneous in another inertial frame Sâ²
(satisfying Îtâ² = 0). Only if these events are additionally co-local in
frame S (satisfying Îx = 0), will they be simultaneous in another frame Sâ².
The Sagnac_effect can be considered a manifestation of the relativity of
simultaneity.[26] Since relativity of simultaneity is a first order effect in
v   {\displaystyle v}  [v],[15] instruments based on the Sagnac effect for
their operation, such as ring_laser_gyroscopes and fiber_optic_gyroscopes, are
capable of extreme levels of sensitivity.[p_14]
**** Time dilation[edit] ****
See also: Time_dilation
The time lapse between two events is not invariant from one observer to
another, but is dependent on the relative speeds of the observers' reference
frames (e.g., the twin_paradox which concerns a twin who flies off in a
spaceship traveling near the speed of light and returns to discover that the
non-traveling twin sibling has aged much more, the paradox being that at
constant velocity we are unable to discern which twin is non-traveling and
which twin travels).
Suppose a clock is at rest in the unprimed system S. The location of the clock
on two different ticks is then characterized by Îx = 0. To find the relation
between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems, Equation 3
can be used to find:
         &#x0394;  t &#x2032;  = &#x03B3;  &#x0394; t   {\displaystyle \Delta
      t'=\gamma \,\Delta t}  [\Delta t' = \gamma\, \Delta t ]    for events
      satisfying        &#x0394; x = 0 &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle \Delta x=0\ .}
      [\Delta x = 0 \ .]
This shows that the time (Îtâ²) between the two ticks as seen in the frame in
which the clock is moving (Sâ²), is longer than the time (Ît) between these
ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock (S). Time dilation explains a
number of physical phenomena; for example, the lifetime of high speed muons
created by the collision of cosmic rays with particles in the Earth's outer
atmosphere and moving towards the surface is greater than the lifetime of
slowly moving muons, created and decaying in a laboratory.[27]
**** Length contraction[edit] ****
See also: Lorentz_contraction
The dimensions (e.g., length) of an object as measured by one observer may be
smaller than the results of measurements of the same object made by another
observer (e.g., the ladder_paradox involves a long ladder traveling near the
speed of light and being contained within a smaller garage).
Similarly, suppose a measuring_rod is at rest and aligned along the x-axis in
the unprimed system S. In this system, the length of this rod is written as
Îx. To measure the length of this rod in the system Sâ², in which the rod is
moving, the distances xâ² to the end points of the rod must be measured
simultaneously in that system Sâ². In other words, the measurement is
characterized by Îtâ² = 0, which can be combined with Equation 3 to find the
relation between the lengths Îx and Îxâ²:
         &#x0394;  x &#x2032;  =    &#x0394; x  &#x03B3;     {\displaystyle
      \Delta x'={\frac {\Delta x}{\gamma }}}  [\Delta x' = \frac{\Delta x}
      {\gamma} ]    for events satisfying        &#x0394;  t &#x2032;  = 0
      &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle \Delta t'=0\ .}  [\Delta t' = 0 \ .]
This shows that the length (Îxâ²) of the rod as measured in the frame in
which it is moving (Sâ²), is shorter than its length (Îx) in its own rest
frame (S).
Time dilation and length contraction are not merely appearances. Time dilation
is explicitly related to our way of measuring time intervals between events
which occur at the same place in a given coordinate system (called "co-local"
events). These time intervals (which can be, and are, actually measured
experimentally by relevant observers) are different in another coordinate
system moving with respect to the first, unless the events, in addition to
being co-local, are also simultaneous. Similarly, length contraction relates to
our measured distances between separated but simultaneous events in a given
coordinate system of choice. If these events are not co-local, but are
separated by distance (space), they will not occur at the same spatial distance
from each other when seen from another moving coordinate system.
**** Lorentz transformation of velocities[edit] ****
See also: Velocity-addition_formula
Consider two frames S and Sâ² in standard configuration. A particle in S moves
in the x direction with velocity vector      u  .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {u}
.}  [{\mathbf  {u}}.] What is its velocity       u &#x2032;     {\displaystyle
\mathbf {u'} }  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {u'} }] in frame Sâ²?
We can write
      Eq. 7:          |  u  |   = u = d x  /  d t &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {|u|} =u=dx/dt\ .}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {|u|} =u=dx/dt\ .}]
      Eq. 8:          |   u &#x2032;   |   =  u &#x2032;  = d  x &#x2032;   /

      [{\displaystyle \mathbf {|u'|} =u'=dx'/dt'\ .}]
Substituting expressions for     d  x &#x2032;    {\displaystyle dx'}  [
{\displaystyle dx'}] and     d  t &#x2032;    {\displaystyle dt'}  [
{\displaystyle dt'}] from Equation 5 into Equation 8, followed by
straightforward mathematical manipulations and back-substitution from
Equation 7 yields the Lorentz transformation of the speed     u
{\displaystyle u}  [u] to      u &#x2032;    {\displaystyle u'}  [u']:
      Eq. 9:         u &#x2032;  =    d  x &#x2032;    d  t &#x2032;     =

      u'={\frac {dx'}{dt'}}={\frac {\gamma (dx-vdt)}{\gamma \left(dt-{\frac
      {vdx}{c^{2}}}\right)}}=}]           d x   d t    &#x2212; v   1 &#x2212;
      (   v  c  2     )   (    d x   d t    )     =    u &#x2212; v   1

      {1-\left({\frac {v}{c^{2}}}\right)\left({\frac {dx}{dt}}\right)}}={\frac
      {u-v}{1-uv/c^{2}}}.}]
The inverse relation is obtained by interchanging the primed and unprimed
symbols and replacing     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] with     &#x2212; v &#xA0;
.   {\displaystyle -v\ .}  [{\displaystyle -v\ .}]
      Eq. 10:        u =     u &#x2032;  + v   1 +  u &#x2032;  v  /   c  2

Equation 10 and Equation 14 can be interpreted as giving the resultant      u
{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }  [{\mathbf  {u}}] of the two velocities      v
{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }  [\mathbf {v} ] and       u &#x2032;   ,
{\displaystyle \mathbf {u'} ,}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {u'} ,}] and they
replace the formula      u =  u &#x2032;  + v    {\displaystyle \mathbf
{u=u'+v} }  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {u=u'+v} }] which is valid in Galilean
relativity. Interpreted in such a fashion, they are commonly referred to as the
relativistic velocity addition (or composition) formulas, valid for the three
axes of S and Sâ² being aligned with each other (although not necessarily in
standard configuration).[8]:47-49
We note the following points:
    * If an object (for example, a photon) were moving at the speed of light in
      one frame (i.e. u = Â±c or uâ² = Â±c), then it would also be moving at
      the speed of light in any other frame, moving at |v| < c.
    * The resultant speed of two velocities with magnitude less than c is
      always a velocity with magnitude less than c.
    * If both |u| and |v| (and then also |uâ²| and |vâ²|) are small with
      respect to the speed of light (that is, e.g., |u/c| âª 1), then the
      intuitive Galilean transformations are recovered from the transformation
      equations for special relativity
    * Attaching a frame to a photon (riding a light beam like Einstein
      considers) requires special treatment of the transformations.
There is nothing special about the x direction in the standard configuration.
The above formalism applies to any direction; and three orthogonal directions
allow dealing with all directions in space by decomposing the velocity vectors
to their components in these directions. See Velocity-addition_formula for
details.
**** Thomas rotation[edit] ****
See also: Thomas_rotation
Figure 4-2. Thomas-Wigner rotation
The composition of two non-collinear Lorentz boosts (i.e. two non-collinear
Lorentz transformations, neither of which involve rotation) results in a
Lorentz transformation that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a
boost and a rotation.
Thomas rotation results from the relativity of simultaneity. In Fig. 4‑2a, a
rod of length     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] in its rest frame (i.e. having a
proper_length of     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L]) rises vertically along the
y‑axis in the ground frame.
In Fig. 4‑2b, the same rod is observed from the frame of a rocket moving at
speed     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] to the right. If we imagine two clocks
situated at the left and right ends of the rod that are synchronized in the
frame of the rod, relativity of simultaneity causes the observer in the rocket
frame to observe (not see) the clock at the right end of the rod as being
advanced in time by     L v  /   c  2   ,   {\displaystyle Lv/c^{2},}  [
{\displaystyle Lv/c^{2},}] and the rod is correspondingly observed as tilted.
[25]:98â99
Unlike second-order relativistic effects such as length contraction or time
dilation, this effect becomes quite significant even at fairly low velocities.
For example, this can be seen in the spin_of_moving_particles, where Thomas
precession is a relativistic correction that applies to the spin of an
elementary particle or the rotation of a macroscopic gyroscope, relating the
angular_velocity of the spin of a particle following a curvilinear orbit to the
angular velocity of the orbital motion.[25]:169â174
Thomas rotation provides the resolution to the well-known "meter stick and hole
paradox".[p_15][25]:98â99
**** Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light[edit] ****
See also: Causality_(physics) and Tachyonic_antitelephone
Figure 4-3. Light cone
In Fig. 4‑3, the time interval between the events A (the "cause") and B (the
"effect") is 'time-like'; i.e., there is a frame of reference in which events A
and B occur at the same location in space, separated only by occurring at
different times. If A precedes B in that frame, then A precedes B in all frames
accessible by a Lorentz transformation. It is possible for matter (or
information) to travel (below light speed) from the location of A, starting at
the time of A, to the location of B, arriving at the time of B, so there can be
a causal relationship (with A the cause and B the effect).
The interval AC in the diagram is 'space-like'; i.e., there is a frame of
reference in which events A and C occur simultaneously, separated only in
space. There are also frames in which A precedes C (as shown) and frames in
which C precedes A. However, there are no frames accessible by a Lorentz
transformation, in which events A and C occur at the same location. If it were
possible for a cause-and-effect relationship to exist between events A and C,
then paradoxes of causality would result.
For example, if signals could be sent faster than light, then signals could be
sent into the sender's past (observer B in the diagrams).[28][p_16] A variety
of causal paradoxes could then be constructed.

Figure 4-4. Causality violation by the use of fictitious
"instantaneous communicators"
Consider the spacetime diagrams in Fig. 4‑4. A and B stand alongside a railroad
track, when a high speed train passes by, with C riding in the last car of the
train and D riding in the leading car. The world lines of A and B are vertical
(ct), distinguishing the stationary position of these observers on the ground,
while the world lines of C and D are tilted forwards (ctâ²), reflecting the
rapid motion of the observers C and D stationary in their train, as observed
from the ground.
   1. Fig. 4‑4a. The event of "B passing a message to D", as the leading car
      passes by, is at the origin of D's frame. D sends the message along the
      train to C in the rear car, using a fictitious "instantaneous
      communicator". The worldline of this message is the fat red arrow along
      the     &#x2212;  x &#x2032;    {\displaystyle -x'}  [-x'] axis, which is
      a line of simultaneity in the primed frames of C and D. In the (unprimed)
      ground frame the signal arrives earlier than it was sent.
   2. Fig. 4‑4b. The event of "C passing the message to A", who is standing by
      the railroad tracks, is at the origin of their frames. Now A sends the
      message along the tracks to B via an "instantaneous communicator". The
      worldline of this message is the blue fat arrow, along the     + x
      {\displaystyle +x}  [{\displaystyle +x}] axis, which is a line of
      simultaneity for the frames of A and B. As seen from the spacetime
      diagram, B will receive the message before having sent it out, a
      violation of causality.[29]
It is not necessary for signals to be instantaneous to violate causality. Even
if the signal from D to C were slightly shallower than the      x &#x2032;
{\displaystyle x'}  [x'] axis (and the signal from A to B slightly steeper than
the     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x] axis), it would still be possible for B to
receive his message before he had sent it. By increasing the speed of the train
to near light speeds, the     c  t &#x2032;    {\displaystyle ct'}  [
{\displaystyle ct'}] and      x &#x2032;    {\displaystyle x'}  [x'] axes can
be squeezed very close to the dashed line representing the speed of light. With
this modified setup, it can be demonstrated that even signals only slightly
faster than the speed of light will result in causality violation.[30]
Therefore, if causality is to be preserved, one of the consequences of special
relativity is that no information signal or material object can travel faster
than_light in vacuum.
This is not to say that all faster than light speeds are impossible. Various
trivial situations can be described where some "things" (not actual matter or
energy) move faster than light.[31] For example, the location where the beam of
a search light hits the bottom of a cloud can move faster than light when the
search light is turned rapidly (although we should be clear that this does not
violate causality or any other relativistic phenomenon).[32][33]
***** Optical effects[edit] *****
**** Dragging effects[edit] ****
Main article: Fizeau_experiment
Figure 5-1. Highly simplified diagram of Fizeau's 1851 experiment.
In 1850, Hippolyte_Fizeau and LÃ©on_Foucault independently established that
light travels more slowly in water than in air, thus validating a prediction of
Fresnel's wave_theory_of_light and invalidating the corresponding prediction of
Newton's corpuscular_theory.[34] The speed of light was measured in still
water. What would be the speed of light in flowing water?
In 1851, Fizeau conducted an experiment to answer this question, a simplified
representation of which is illustrated in Fig. 5‑1. A beam of light is divided
by a beam splitter, and the split beams are passed in opposite directions
through a tube of flowing water. They are recombined to form interference
fringes, indicating a difference in optical path length, that an observer can
view. The experiment demonstrated that dragging of the light by the flowing
water caused displacement of the fringes, showing that the motion of the water
had affected the speed of the light.
According to the theories prevailing at the time, light traveling through a
moving medium would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus the
speed of the medium. Contrary to expectation, Fizeau found that although light
appeared to be dragged by the water, the magnitude of the dragging was much
lower than expected. If      u &#x2032;  = c  /  n   {\displaystyle u'=c/n}  [
{\displaystyle u'=c/n}] is the speed of light in still water, and     v
{\displaystyle v}  [v] is the speed of the water, and      u  &#x00B1;
{\displaystyle u_{\pm }}  [{\displaystyle u_{\pm }}] is the water-bourne speed
of light in the lab frame with the flow of water adding to or subtracting from
the speed of light, then
          u  &#x00B1;   =   c n   &#x00B1; v  (  1 &#x2212;   1  n  2      )

      {n^{2}}}\right)\ .}  [{\displaystyle u_{\pm }={\frac {c}{n}}\pm v\left(1-
      {\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\right)\ .}]
Fizeau's results, although consistent with Fresnel's earlier hypothesis of
partial_aether_dragging, were extremely disconcerting to physicists of the
time. Among other things, the presence of an index of refraction term meant
that, since     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] depends on wavelength, the aether
must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.[note_8] A
variety of theoretical explanations were proposed to explain Fresnel's dragging
coefficient that were completely at odds with each other. Even before the
MichelsonâMorley_experiment, Fizeau's experimental results were among a
number of observations that created a critical situation in explaining the
optics of moving bodies.[35]
From the point of view of special relativity, Fizeau's result is nothing but an
approximation to Equation 10, the relativistic formula for composition of
velocities.[24]

**** Relativistic aberration of light[edit] ****
Main articles: Aberration_of_light and Light-time_correction
Figure 5-2. Illustration of stellar aberration
Because of the finite speed of light, if the relative motions of a source and
receiver include a transverse component, then the direction from which light
arrives at the receiver will be displaced from the geometric position in space
of the source relative to the receiver. The classical calculation of the
displacement takes two forms and makes different predictions depending on
whether the receiver, the source, or both are in motion with respect to the
medium. (1) If the receiver is in motion, the displacement would be the
consequence of the aberration_of_light. The incident angle of the beam relative
to the receiver would be calculable from the vector sum of the receiver's
motions and the velocity of the incident light.[36] (2) If the source is in
motion, the displacement would be the consequence of light-time_correction. The
displacement of the apparent position of the source from its geometric position
would be the result of the source's motion during the time that its light takes
to reach the receiver.[37]
The classical explanation failed experimental test. Since the aberration angle
depends on the relationship between the velocity of the receiver and the speed
of the incident light, passage of the incident light through a refractive
medium should change the aberration angle. In 1810, Arago used this expected
phenomenon in a failed attempt to measure the speed of light,[38] and in 1870,
George_Airy tested the hypothesis using a water-filled telescope, finding that,
against expectation, the measured aberration was identical to the aberration
measured with an air-filled telescope.[39] A "cumbrous" attempt to explain
these results used the hypothesis of partial aether-drag,[40] but was
incompatible with the results of the MichelsonâMorley_experiment, which
apparently demanded complete aether-drag.[41]
Assuming inertial frames, the relativistic expression for the aberration of
light is applicable to both the receiver moving and source moving cases. A
variety of trigonometrically equivalent formulas have been published. Expressed
in terms of the variables in Fig. 5‑2, these include[24]:57â60

**** Relativistic Doppler effect[edit] ****
Main article: Relativistic_Doppler_effect
*** Relativistic longitudinal Doppler effect[edit] ***
The classical Doppler effect depends on whether the source, receiver, or both
are in motion with respect to the medium. The relativistic Doppler effect is
independent of any medium. Nevertheless, relativistic Doppler shift for the
longitudinal case, with source and receiver moving directly towards or away
from each other, can be derived as if it were the classical phenomenon, but
modified by the addition of a time_dilation term, and that is the treatment
described here.[42][43]
Assume the receiver and the source are moving away from each other with a
relative speed     v    {\displaystyle v\,}  [v\,] as measured by an observer
on the receiver or the source (The sign convention adopted here is that     v
{\displaystyle v\,}  [v\,] is negative if the receiver and the source are
moving towards each other). Assume that the source is stationary in the medium.
Then
          f  r   = ( 1 &#x2212; v  /   c  s   )  f  s     {\displaystyle f_{r}=
      (1-v/c_{s})f_{s}}  [{\displaystyle f_{r}=(1-v/c_{s})f_{s}}]
where      c  s     {\displaystyle c_{s}}  [c_{s}] is the speed of sound.
For light, and with the receiver moving at relativistic speeds, clocks on the
receiver are time_dilated relative to clocks at the source. The receiver will
measure the received frequency to be
          f  r   = &#x03B3; ( 1 &#x2212; &#x03B2; )  f  s     {\displaystyle f_
      {r}=\gamma (1-\beta )f_{s}}  [{\displaystyle f_{r}=\gamma (1-\beta )f_
      {s}}]     =     1 &#x2212; &#x03B2;   1 + &#x03B2;       f  s   .
      {\displaystyle ={\sqrt {\frac {1-\beta }{1+\beta }}}\,f_{s}.}  [
      {\displaystyle ={\sqrt {\frac {1-\beta }{1+\beta }}}\,f_{s}.}]
where
         &#x03B2; = v  /  c   {\displaystyle \beta =v/c}  [{\displaystyle \beta
      =v/c}]    and
         &#x03B3; =   1  1 &#x2212;  &#x03B2;  2        {\displaystyle \gamma =
      {\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\beta ^{2}}}}}  [\gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\beta ^
      {2}}}}]    is the Lorentz_factor.
An identical expression for relativistic Doppler shift is obtained when
performing the analysis in the reference frame of the receiver with a moving
source.[44][15]
*** Transverse Doppler effect[edit] ***
Figure 5-3. Transverse Doppler effect for two scenarios: (a) receiver moving in
a circle around the source; (b) source moving in a circle around the receiver.
The transverse Doppler effect is one of the main novel predictions of the
special theory of relativity.
Classically, one might expect that if source and receiver are moving
transversely with respect to each other with no longitudinal component to their
relative motions, that there should be no Doppler shift in the light arriving
at the receiver.
Special relativity predicts otherwise. Fig. 5‑3 illustrates two common variants
of this scenario. Both variants can be analyzed using simple time dilation
arguments.[15] In Fig. 5‑3a, the receiver observes light from the source as
being blueshifted by a factor of     &#x03B3;   {\displaystyle \gamma }
[\gamma ]. In Fig. 5‑3b, the light is redshifted by the same factor.
**** Measurement versus visual appearance[edit] ****
Time dilation and length contraction are not optical illusions, but genuine
effects. Measurements of these effects are not an artifact of Doppler_shift,
nor are they the result of neglecting to take into account the time it takes
light to travel from an event to an observer. For example, considering time,
the elapsed time between two events, measured by identical clocks held by
different observers which are moving relative to one another (measured perhaps
in seconds), is different.
Scientists make a fundamental distinction between measurement or observation on
the one hand, versus visual appearance, or what one sees. The measured shape of
an object is a hypothetical snapshot of all of the object's points as they
exist at a single moment in time. The visual appearance of an object, however,
is affected by the varying lengths of time that light takes to travel from
different points on the object to one's eye.
Figure 5-4. Comparison of the measured length contraction of a cube versus its
visual appearance.
For many years, the distinction between the two had not been generally
appreciated, and it had generally been thought that a length contracted object
passing by an observer would in fact actually be seen as length contracted. In
1959, James Terrell and Roger_Penrose independently pointed out that
differential time lag effects in signals reaching the observer from the
different parts of a moving object result in a fast moving object's visual
appearance being quite different from its measured shape. For example, a
receding object would appear contracted, an approaching object would appear
elongated, and a passing object would have a skew appearance that has been
likened to a rotation.[p_19][p_20][45][46] A sphere in motion retains the
appearance of a sphere, although images on the surface of the sphere will
appear distorted.[47]
Figure 5-5. Galaxy M87 streams out a black-hole-powered jet of electrons and
other sub-atomic particles traveling at nearly the speed of light.
Fig. 5‑4 illustrates a cube viewed from a distance of four times the length of
its sides. At high speeds, the sides of the cube that are perpendicular to the
direction of motion appear hyperbolic in shape. The cube is actually not
rotated. Rather, light from the rear of the cube takes longer to reach one's
eyes compared with light from the front, during which time the cube has moved
to the right. This illusion has come to be known as Terrell_rotation or the
TerrellâPenrose effect.[note_9]
Another example where visual appearance is at odds with measurement comes from
the observation of apparent superluminal_motion in various radio_galaxies, BL
Lac_objects, quasars, and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-
speed_jets of matter at narrow angles with respect to the viewer. An apparent
optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel.[48]
[49][50] In Fig. 5‑5, galaxy M87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic
particles almost directly towards us, but PenroseâTerrell rotation causes the
jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of
the cube in Fig. 5‑4 has been stretched out.[51]
***** Dynamics[edit] *****
Section Consequences_derived_from_the_Lorentz_transformation dealt strictly
with kinematics, the study of the motion of points, bodies, and systems of
bodies without considering the forces that caused the motion. This section
discusses masses, forces, energy and so forth, and as such requires
consideration of physical effects beyond those encompassed by the Lorentz
transformation itself.
**** Equivalence of mass and energy[edit] ****
Main article: Massâenergy_equivalence
As an object's speed approaches the speed of light from an observer's point of
view, its relativistic_mass increases thereby making it more and more difficult
to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference.
The energy content of an object at rest with mass m equals mc2. Conservation of
energy implies that, in any reaction, a decrease of the sum of the masses of
particles must be accompanied by an increase in kinetic energies of the
particles after the reaction. Similarly, the mass of an object can be increased
by taking in kinetic energies.
In addition to the papers referenced aboveâwhich give derivations of the
Lorentz transformation and describe the foundations of special
relativityâEinstein also wrote at least four papers giving heuristic
arguments for the equivalence (and transmutability) of mass and energy, for E =
mc2.
Massâenergy equivalence is a consequence of special relativity. The energy
and momentum, which are separate in Newtonian mechanics, form a four-vector in
relativity, and this relates the time component (the energy) to the space
components (the momentum) in a non-trivial way. For an object at rest, the
energyâmomentum four-vector is (E/c, 0, 0, 0): it has a time component which
is the energy, and three space components which are zero. By changing frames
with a Lorentz transformation in the x direction with a small value of the
velocity v, the energy momentum four-vector becomes (E/c, Ev/c2, 0, 0). The
momentum is equal to the energy multiplied by the velocity divided by c2. As
such, the Newtonian mass of an object, which is the ratio of the momentum to
the velocity for slow velocities, is equal to E/c2.
The energy and momentum are properties of matter and radiation, and it is
impossible to deduce that they form a four-vector just from the two basic
postulates of special relativity by themselves, because these don't talk about
matter or radiation, they only talk about space and time. The derivation
therefore requires some additional physical reasoning. In his 1905 paper,
Einstein used the additional principles that Newtonian mechanics should hold
for slow velocities, so that there is one energy scalar and one three-vector
momentum at slow velocities, and that the conservation law for energy and
momentum is exactly true in relativity. Furthermore, he assumed that the energy
of light is transformed by the same Doppler-shift factor as its frequency,
which he had previously shown to be true based on Maxwell's equations.[p_1] The
first of Einstein's papers on this subject was "Does the Inertia of a Body
Depend upon its Energy Content?" in 1905.[p_21] Although Einstein's argument in
this paper is nearly universally accepted by physicists as correct, even self-
evident, many authors over the years have suggested that it is wrong.[52] Other
authors suggest that the argument was merely inconclusive because it relied on
some implicit assumptions.[53]
Einstein acknowledged the controversy over his derivation in his 1907 survey
paper on special relativity. There he notes that it is problematic to rely on
Maxwell's equations for the heuristic massâenergy argument. The argument in
his 1905 paper can be carried out with the emission of any massless particles,
but the Maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the
emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work. To emit
electromagnetic waves, all you have to do is shake a charged particle, and this
is clearly doing work, so that the emission is of energy.[p_22][note_10]
**** How far can one travel from the Earth?[edit] ****
See also: Space_travel_using_constant_acceleration
Since one can not travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can
never travel farther from Earth than 40 light years if the traveler is active
between the ages of 20 and 60. One would easily think that a traveler would
never be able to reach more than the very few solar systems which exist within
the limit of 20â40 light years from the earth. But that would be a mistaken
conclusion. Because of time dilation, a hypothetical spaceship can travel
thousands of light years during the pilot's 40 active years. If a spaceship
could be built that accelerates at a constant 1g, it will, after a little less
than a year, be travelling at almost the speed of light as seen from Earth.
This is described by:
         v ( t ) =    a t   1 +     a  2    t  2     c  2
      {\displaystyle v(t)={\frac {at}{\sqrt {1+{\frac {a^{2}t^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}
      [{\displaystyle v(t)={\frac {at}{\sqrt {1+{\frac {a^{2}t^{2}}{c^
      {2}}}}}}}]
where v(t) is the velocity at a time t, a is the acceleration of 1g and t is
the time as measured by people on Earth.[p_23] Therefore, after one year of
accelerating at 9.81 m/s2, the spaceship will be travelling at v = 0.77c
relative to Earth. Time dilation will increase the travellers life span as seen
from the reference frame of the Earth to 2.7 years, but his lifespan measured
by a clock travelling with him will not change. During his journey, people on
Earth will experience more time than he does. A 5-year round trip for him will
take 6.5 Earth years and cover a distance of over 6 light-years. A 20-year
round trip for him (5 years accelerating, 5 decelerating, twice each) will land
him back on Earth having travelled for 335 Earth years and a distance of 331
light years.[54] A full 40-year trip at 1g will appear on Earth to last 58,000
years and cover a distance of 55,000 light years. A 40-year trip at 1.1g will
take 148,000 Earth years and cover about 140,000 light years. A one-way 28 year
(14 years accelerating, 14 decelerating as measured with the astronaut's clock)
trip at 1g acceleration could reach 2,000,000 light-years to the Andromeda
Galaxy.[54] This same time dilation is why a muon travelling close to c is
observed to travel much farther than c times its half-life (when at rest).[55]
***** Relativity and unifying electromagnetism[edit] *****
Main articles: Classical_electromagnetism_and_special_relativity and Covariant
formulation_of_classical_electromagnetism
Theoretical investigation in classical_electromagnetism led to the discovery of
wave propagation. Equations generalizing the electromagnetic effects found that
finite propagation speed of the E and B fields required certain behaviors on
charged particles. The general study of moving charges forms the
LiÃ©nardâWiechert_potential, which is a step towards special relativity.
The Lorentz transformation of the electric_field of a moving charge into a non-
moving observer's reference frame results in the appearance of a mathematical
term commonly called the magnetic_field. Conversely, the magnetic field
generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely electrostatic
field in a comoving frame of reference. Maxwell's_equations are thus simply an
empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the
Universe. As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and
thus intertwined, one speaks of electromagnetic fields. Special relativity
provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one
inertial frame appears in another inertial frame.
Maxwell's_equations in the 3D form are already consistent with the physical
content of special relativity, although they are easier to manipulate in a
manifestly_covariant form, i.e. in the language of tensor calculus.[56]
***** Theories of relativity and quantum mechanics[edit] *****
Special relativity can be combined with quantum_mechanics to form relativistic
quantum_mechanics and quantum_electrodynamics. It is an unsolved_problem_in
physics how general_relativity and quantum mechanics can be unified; quantum
gravity and a "theory_of_everything", which require a unification including
general relativity too, are active and ongoing areas in theoretical research.
The early BohrâSommerfeld_atomic_model explained the fine_structure of alkali
metal atoms using both special relativity and the preliminary knowledge on
quantum_mechanics of the time.[57]
In 1928, Paul_Dirac constructed an influential relativistic_wave_equation, now
known as the Dirac_equation in his honour,[p_24] that is fully compatible both
with special relativity and with the final version of quantum theory existing
after 1926. This equation explained not only the intrinsic angular momentum of
the electrons called spin, it also led to the prediction of the antiparticle of
the electron (the positron),[p_24][p_25] and fine_structure could only be fully
explained with special relativity. It was the first foundation of relativistic
quantum_mechanics. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, spin is
phenomenological and cannot be explained.
On the other hand, the existence of antiparticles leads to the conclusion that
relativistic quantum mechanics is not enough for a more accurate and complete
theory of particle interactions. Instead, a theory of particles interpreted as
quantized fields, called quantum_field_theory, becomes necessary; in which
particles can be created_and_destroyed throughout space and time.
***** Status[edit] *****
Main articles: Tests_of_special_relativity and Criticism_of_relativity_theory
Special relativity in its Minkowski_spacetime is accurate only when the
absolute_value of the gravitational_potential is much less than c2 in the
region of interest.[58] In a strong gravitational field, one must use general
relativity. General relativity becomes special relativity at the limit of a
weak field. At very small scales, such as at the Planck_length and below,
quantum effects must be taken into consideration resulting in quantum_gravity.
However, at macroscopic scales and in the absence of strong gravitational
fields, special relativity is experimentally tested to extremely high degree of
accuracy (10â20)[59] and thus accepted by the physics community. Experimental
results which appear to contradict it are not reproducible and are thus widely
believed to be due to experimental errors.
Special relativity is mathematically self-consistent, and it is an organic part
of all modern physical theories, most notably quantum_field_theory, string
theory, and general relativity (in the limiting case of negligible
gravitational fields).
Newtonian mechanics mathematically follows from special relativity at small
velocities (compared to the speed of light) â thus Newtonian mechanics can be
considered as a special relativity of slow moving bodies. See classical
mechanics for a more detailed discussion.
Several experiments predating Einstein's 1905 paper are now interpreted as
evidence for relativity. Of these it is known Einstein was aware of the Fizeau
experiment before 1905,[60] and historians have concluded that Einstein was at
least aware of the MichelsonâMorley experiment as early as 1899 despite
claims he made in his later years that it played no role in his development of
the theory.[10]
    * The Fizeau_experiment (1851, repeated by Michelson and Morley in 1886)
      measured the speed of light in moving media, with results that are
      consistent with relativistic addition of colinear velocities.
    * The famous MichelsonâMorley_experiment (1881, 1887) gave further
      support to the postulate that detecting an absolute reference velocity
      was not achievable. It should be stated here that, contrary to many
      alternative claims, it said little about the invariance of the speed of
      light with respect to the source and observer's velocity, as both source
      and observer were travelling together at the same velocity at all times.
    * The TroutonâNoble_experiment (1903) showed that the torque on a
      capacitor is independent of position and inertial reference frame.
    * The Experiments_of_Rayleigh_and_Brace (1902, 1904) showed that length
      contraction doesn't lead to birefringence for a co-moving observer, in
      accordance with the relativity principle.
Particle_accelerators routinely accelerate and measure the properties of
particles moving at near the speed of light, where their behavior is completely
consistent with relativity theory and inconsistent with the earlier Newtonian
mechanics. These machines would simply not work if they were not engineered
according to relativistic principles. In addition, a considerable number of
modern experiments have been conducted to test special relativity. Some
examples:
    * Tests_of_relativistic_energy_and_momentum â testing the limiting speed
      of particles
    * IvesâStilwell_experiment â testing relativistic Doppler effect and
      time dilation
    * Experimental_testing_of_time_dilation â relativistic effects on a fast-
      moving particle's half-life
    * KennedyâThorndike_experiment â time dilation in accordance with
      Lorentz transformations
    * HughesâDrever_experiment â testing isotropy of space and mass
    * Modern_searches_for_Lorentz_violation â various modern tests
    * Experiments to test emission_theory demonstrated that the speed of light
      is independent of the speed of the emitter.
    * Experiments to test the aether_drag_hypothesis â no "aether flow
      obstruction".

*** Comparison between flat Euclidean space and Minkowski space[edit] ***

Special relativity uses a 'flat' 4-dimensional Minkowski space â an example
of a spacetime. Minkowski spacetime appears to be very similar to the standard
3-dimensional Euclidean_space, but there is a crucial difference with respect
to time.
In 3D space, the differential of distance (line element) ds is defined by
         d  s  2   = d  x  &#x22C5; d  x  = d  x  1   2   + d  x  2   2   + d
      x  3   2   ,   {\displaystyle ds^{2}=d\mathbf {x} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =dx_
      {1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}+dx_{3}^{2},}  [ ds^2 = d\mathbf{x} \cdot d\mathbf{x} =
      dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2, ]
where dx = (dx1, dx2, dx3) are the differentials of the three spatial
dimensions. In Minkowski geometry, there is an extra dimension with coordinate
X0 derived from time, such that the distance differential fulfills
         d  s  2   = &#x2212; d  X  0   2   + d  X  1   2   + d  X  2   2   + d
      X  3   2   ,   {\displaystyle ds^{2}=-dX_{0}^{2}+dX_{1}^{2}+dX_{2}^
      {2}+dX_{3}^{2},}  [ ds^2 = -dX_0^2 + dX_1^2 + dX_2^2 + dX_3^2, ]
where dX = (dX0, dX1, dX2, dX3) are the differentials of the four spacetime
dimensions. This suggests a deep theoretical insight: special relativity is
simply a rotational_symmetry of our spacetime, analogous to the rotational
symmetry of Euclidean space (see Fig. 10‑1).[62] Just as Euclidean space uses a
Euclidean_metric, so spacetime uses a Minkowski_metric. Basically, special
relativity can be stated as the invariance of any spacetime interval (that is
the 4D distance between any two events) when viewed from any inertial reference
frame. All equations and effects of special relativity can be derived from this
rotational symmetry (the PoincarÃ©_group) of Minkowski spacetime.
The actual form of ds above depends on the metric and on the choices for the X0
coordinate. To make the time coordinate look like the space coordinates, it can
be treated as imaginary: X0 = ict (this is called a Wick_rotation). According
to Misner,_Thorne_and_Wheeler (1971, Â§2.3), ultimately the deeper
understanding of both special and general relativity will come from the study
of the Minkowski metric (described below) and to take X0 = ct, rather than a
"disguised" Euclidean metric using ict as the time coordinate.
Some authors use X0 = t, with factors of c elsewhere to compensate; for
instance, spatial coordinates are divided by c or factors of cÂ±2 are included
in the metric tensor.[63] These numerous conventions can be superseded by using
natural_units where c = 1. Then space and time have equivalent units, and no
factors of c appear anywhere.
*** 3D spacetime[edit] ***
Figure 10-2. Three-dimensional dual-cone.
If we reduce the spatial dimensions to 2, so that we can represent the physics
in a 3D space
         d  s  2   = d  x  1   2   + d  x  2   2   &#x2212;  c  2   d  t  2   ,
      {\displaystyle ds^{2}=dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}-c^{2}dt^{2},}  [ ds^2 =
      dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 - c^2 dt^2, ]
we see that the null geodesics lie along a dual-cone (see Fig. 10‑2) defined by
the equation;
         d  s  2   = 0 = d  x  1   2   + d  x  2   2   &#x2212;  c  2   d  t  2
      {\displaystyle ds^{2}=0=dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}-c^{2}dt^{2}}  [ ds^2 = 0 =
      dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 - c^2 dt^2 ]
or simply
         d  x  1   2   + d  x  2   2   =  c  2   d  t  2   ,   {\displaystyle
      dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}=c^{2}dt^{2},}  [ dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 = c^2 dt^2, ]
âwhich is the equation of a circle of radius c dt.
*** 4D spacetime[edit] ***
If we extend this to three spatial dimensions, the null geodesics are the 4-
dimensional cone:
         d  s  2   = 0 = d  x  1   2   + d  x  2   2   + d  x  3   2   &#x2212;
      c  2   d  t  2     {\displaystyle ds^{2}=0=dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}+dx_{3}^
      {2}-c^{2}dt^{2}}  [ ds^2 = 0 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 - c^2 dt^2 ]
so
         d  x  1   2   + d  x  2   2   + d  x  3   2   =  c  2   d  t  2   .
      {\displaystyle dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}+dx_{3}^{2}=c^{2}dt^{2}.}  [ dx_1^2 +
      dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 = c^2 dt^2. ]
Figure 10-3. Concentric spheres, illustrating in 3-space the null geodesics of
a 4-dimensional cone in spacetime.
As illustrated in Fig. 10‑3, the null geodesics can be visualized as a set of
continuous concentric spheres with radii = c dt.
This null dual-cone represents the "line of sight" of a point in space. That
is, when we look at the stars and say "The light from that star which I am
receiving is X years old", we are looking down this line of sight: a null
geodesic. We are looking at an event a distance     d =    x  1   2   +  x  2
2   +  x  3   2       {\displaystyle d={\sqrt {x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}}}}
[d = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2} ] away and a time d/c in the past. For this
reason the null dual cone is also known as the 'light cone'. (The point in the
lower left of the Fig. 10‑2 represents the star, the origin represents the
observer, and the line represents the null geodesic "line of sight".)
The cone in the ât region is the information that the point is 'receiving',
while the cone in the +t section is the information that the point is
'sending'.
The geometry of Minkowski space can be depicted using Minkowski_diagrams, which
are useful also in understanding many of the thought-experiments in special
relativity.
Note that, in 4d spacetime, the concept of the center_of_mass becomes more
complicated, see center_of_mass_(relativistic).

*** Transformations of physical quantities between reference frames[edit] ***
Above, the Lorentz transformation for the time coordinate and three space
coordinates illustrates that they are intertwined. This is true more generally:
certain pairs of "timelike" and "spacelike" quantities naturally combine on
equal footing under the same Lorentz transformation.
The Lorentz transformation in standard configuration above, i.e. for a boost in

In Newtonian mechanics, quantities which have magnitude and direction are
mathematically described as 3d vectors in Euclidean space, and in general they
are parametrized by time. In special relativity, this notion is extended by
adding the appropriate timelike quantity to a spacelike vector quantity, and we
have 4d vectors, or "four_vectors", in Minkowski spacetime. The components of
vectors are written using tensor_index_notation, as this has numerous
advantages. The notation makes it clear the equations are manifestly_covariant
under the PoincarÃ©_group, thus bypassing the tedious calculations to check
this fact. In constructing such equations, we often find that equations
previously thought to be unrelated are, in fact, closely connected being part
of the same tensor equation. Recognizing other physical quantities as tensors
simplifies their transformation laws. Throughout, upper indices (superscripts)
are contravariant indices rather than exponents except when they indicate a
square (this should be clear from the context), and lower indices (subscripts)
are covariant indices. For simplicity and consistency with the earlier
equations, Cartesian coordinates will be used.
The simplest example of a four-vector is the position of an event in spacetime,
which constitutes a timelike component ct and spacelike component x = (x, y,
z), in a contravariant position four_vector with components:
          X  &#x03BD;   = (  X  0   ,  X  1   ,  X  2   ,  X  3   ) = ( c t , x
      , y , z ) = ( c t ,  x  ) .   {\displaystyle X^{\nu }=(X^{0},X^{1},X^
      {2},X^{3})=(ct,x,y,z)=(ct,\mathbf {x} ).}  [X^{\nu }=(X^{0},X^{1},X^
      {2},X^{3})=(ct,x,y,z)=(ct,{\mathbf  {x}}).]
where we define X0 = ct so that the time coordinate has the same dimension of
distance as the other spatial dimensions; so that space and time are treated
equally.[64][65][66] Now the transformation of the contravariant components of
the position 4-vector can be compactly written as:
          X   &#x03BC; &#x2032;    =  &#x039B;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;
      &#x03BD;    X  &#x03BD;     {\displaystyle X^{\mu '}=\Lambda ^{\mu '}{}_
      {\nu }X^{\nu }}  [X^{\mu'}=\Lambda^{\mu'}{}_\nu X^\nu]
where there is an implied_summation on     &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle \nu }
[\nu ] from 0 to 3, and      &#x039B;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;        &#x03BD;
{\displaystyle \Lambda ^{\mu '}{}_{\nu }}  [\Lambda^{\mu'}{}_{\nu}] is a
matrix.
More generally, all contravariant components of a four-vector      T  &#x03BD;
{\displaystyle T^{\nu }}  [T^\nu] transform from one frame to another frame by
a Lorentz_transformation:
          T   &#x03BC; &#x2032;    =  &#x039B;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;
      &#x03BD;    T  &#x03BD;     {\displaystyle T^{\mu '}=\Lambda ^{\mu '}{}_
      {\nu }T^{\nu }}  [T^{\mu'} = \Lambda^{\mu'}{}_{\nu} T^\nu]
Examples of other 4-vectors include the four-velocity      U  &#x03BC;   ,
{\displaystyle U^{\mu },}  [{\displaystyle U^{\mu },}] defined as the
derivative of the position 4-vector with respect to proper_time:
          U  &#x03BC;   =    d  X  &#x03BC;     d &#x03C4;    = &#x03B3; ( v )
      ( c ,  v  x   ,  v  y   ,  v  z   ) = &#x03B3; ( v ) ( c ,  v  ) .
      {\displaystyle U^{\mu }={\frac {dX^{\mu }}{d\tau }}=\gamma (v)(c,v_{x},v_
      {y},v_{z})=\gamma (v)(c,\mathbf {v} ).}  [U^{\mu }={\frac  {dX^{\mu }}
      {d\tau }}=\gamma (v)(c,v_{x},v_{y},v_{z})=\gamma (v)(c,{\mathbf  {v}}).]
where the Lorentz factor is:
         &#x03B3; ( v ) =   1  1 &#x2212;   (   v c   )   2        v  2   =  v
      x   2   +  v  y   2   +  v  z   2   .   {\displaystyle \gamma (v)={\frac
      {1}{\sqrt {1-\left({\frac {v}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}\qquad v^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_
      {y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle \gamma (v)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\left
      ({\frac {v}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}\qquad v^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^
      {2}.}]
The relativistic_energy     E = &#x03B3; ( v ) m  c  2     {\displaystyle
E=\gamma (v)mc^{2}}  [E = \gamma(v)mc^2] and relativistic_momentum      p  =
&#x03B3; ( v ) m  v    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =\gamma (v)m\mathbf {v} }
[\mathbf{p} = \gamma(v)m \mathbf{v}] of an object are respectively the timelike
and spacelike components of a contravariant four_momentum vector:
          P  &#x03BC;   = m  U  &#x03BC;   = m &#x03B3; ( v ) ( c ,  v  x   ,
      v  y   ,  v  z   ) =  (    E c   ,  p  x   ,  p  y   ,  p  z    )  =
      (    E c   ,  p   )  .   {\displaystyle P^{\mu }=mU^{\mu }=m\gamma (v)
      (c,v_{x},v_{y},v_{z})=\left({\frac {E}{c}},p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\right)=\left
      ({\frac {E}{c}},\mathbf {p} \right).}  [{\displaystyle P^{\mu }=mU^{\mu
      }=m\gamma (v)(c,v_{x},v_{y},v_{z})=\left({\frac {E}{c}},p_{x},p_{y},p_
      {z}\right)=\left({\frac {E}{c}},\mathbf {p} \right).}]
where m is the invariant_mass.
The four-acceleration is the proper time derivative of 4-velocity:
          A  &#x03BC;   =    d  U  &#x03BC;     d &#x03C4;    .
      {\displaystyle A^{\mu }={\frac {dU^{\mu }}{d\tau }}.}  [{\displaystyle A^
      {\mu }={\frac {dU^{\mu }}{d\tau }}.}]
The transformation rules for three-dimensional velocities and accelerations are
very awkward; even above in standard configuration the velocity equations are
quite complicated owing to their non-linearity. On the other hand, the
transformation of four-velocity and four-acceleration are simpler by means of
the Lorentz transformation matrix.
The four-gradient of a scalar_field Ï transforms covariantly rather than
contravariantly:
           (      1 c      &#x2202; &#x03D5;   &#x2202;  t &#x2032;

      0     0   0   0   1    )   .   {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}{\frac {1}
      {c}}{\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t'}}&{\frac {\partial \phi }

      {pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\gamma &+\beta \gamma &0&0\\+\beta \gamma
      &\gamma &0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}.}  [{\displaystyle {\begin

      &0&0\\+\beta \gamma &\gamma &0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}.}]
which is the transpose of:
         (  &#x2202;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;    &#x03D5; ) =  &#x039B;   &#x03BC;
      &#x2032;        &#x03BD;   (  &#x2202;  &#x03BD;   &#x03D5; )   &#x2202;
      &#x03BC;   &#x2261;   &#x2202;  &#x2202;  x  &#x03BC;      .
      {\displaystyle (\partial _{\mu '}\phi )=\Lambda _{\mu '}{}^{\nu }
      (\partial _{\nu }\phi )\qquad \partial _{\mu }\equiv {\frac {\partial }

      _{\mu '}{}^{\nu }(\partial _{\nu }\phi )\qquad \partial _{\mu }\equiv
      {\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{\mu }}}.}]
only in Cartesian coordinates. It's the covariant_derivative which transforms
in manifest covariance, in Cartesian coordinates this happens to reduce to the
partial derivatives, but not in other coordinates.
More generally, the covariant components of a 4-vector transform according to
the inverse Lorentz transformation:
          T   &#x03BC; &#x2032;    =  &#x039B;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;
      &#x03BD;    T  &#x03BD;   ,   {\displaystyle T_{\mu '}=\Lambda _{\mu '}
      {}^{\nu }T_{\nu },}  [{\displaystyle T_{\mu '}=\Lambda _{\mu '}{}^{\nu
      }T_{\nu },}]
where      &#x039B;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;        &#x03BD;     {\displaystyle
\Lambda _{\mu '}{}^{\nu }}  [{\displaystyle \Lambda _{\mu '}{}^{\nu }}] is the
reciprocal matrix of      &#x039B;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;        &#x03BD;
{\displaystyle \Lambda ^{\mu '}{}_{\nu }}  [\Lambda^{\mu'}{}_{\nu}].
The postulates of special relativity constrain the exact form the Lorentz
transformation matrices take.
More generally, most physical quantities are best described as (components of)
tensors. So to transform from one frame to another, we use the well-known
tensor_transformation_law[67]
          T   &#x03B8; &#x2032;   &#x03B9; &#x2032;  &#x22EF;  &#x03BA;

by this rule.
An example of a four dimensional second order antisymmetric_tensor is the
relativistic_angular_momentum, which has six components: three are the
classical angular_momentum, and the other three are related to the boost of the
center of mass of the system. The derivative of the relativistic angular
momentum with respect to proper time is the relativistic torque, also second
order antisymmetric_tensor.
The electromagnetic_field_tensor is another second order antisymmetric tensor
field, with six components: three for the electric_field and another three for
the magnetic_field. There is also the stressâenergy_tensor for the
electromagnetic field, namely the electromagnetic_stressâenergy_tensor.
*** Metric[edit] ***
The metric_tensor allows one to define the inner_product of two vectors, which
in turn allows one to assign a magnitude to the vector. Given the four-
dimensional nature of spacetime the Minkowski_metric Î· has components (valid
in any inertial_reference_frame) which can be arranged in a 4 Ã 4 matrix:
          &#x03B7;  &#x03B1; &#x03B2;   =   (    &#x2212; 1   0   0   0     0
      1   0   0     0   0   1   0     0   0   0   1    )     {\displaystyle
      \eta _{\alpha \beta }={\begin{pmatrix}-
      1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}}  [\eta_{\alpha\beta} =
      \begin{pmatrix}
      -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
      0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 1
      \end{pmatrix}]
which is equal to its reciprocal,      &#x03B7;  &#x03B1; &#x03B2;
{\displaystyle \eta ^{\alpha \beta }}  [\eta^{\alpha\beta}], in those frames.
Throughout we use the signs as above, different authors use different
conventions â see Minkowski_metric alternative signs.
The PoincarÃ©_group is the most general group of transformations which
preserves the Minkowski metric:
          &#x03B7;  &#x03B1; &#x03B2;   =  &#x03B7;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;
      &#x03BD; &#x2032;     &#x039B;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;        &#x03B1;
      &#x039B;   &#x03BD; &#x2032;        &#x03B2;     {\displaystyle \eta _
      {\alpha \beta }=\eta _{\mu '\nu '}\Lambda ^{\mu '}{}_{\alpha }\Lambda ^
      {\nu '}{}_{\beta }}  [{\displaystyle \eta _{\alpha \beta }=\eta _{\mu
      '\nu '}\Lambda ^{\mu '}{}_{\alpha }\Lambda ^{\nu '}{}_{\beta }}]
and this is the physical symmetry underlying special relativity.
The metric can be used for raising_and_lowering_indices on vectors and tensors.
Invariants can be constructed using the metric, the inner product of a 4-vector
T with another 4-vector S is:
          T  &#x03B1;    S  &#x03B1;   =  T  &#x03B1;    &#x03B7;  &#x03B1;
      &#x03B2;    S  &#x03B2;   =  T  &#x03B1;    &#x03B7;  &#x03B1; &#x03B2;
      S  &#x03B2;   =  invariant scalar    {\displaystyle T^{\alpha }S_{\alpha
      }=T^{\alpha }\eta _{\alpha \beta }S^{\beta }=T_{\alpha }\eta ^{\alpha
      \beta }S_{\beta }={\text{invariant scalar}}}  [T^{\alpha}S_{\alpha}=T^
      {\alpha}\eta_{\alpha\beta}S^{\beta} = T_{\alpha}\eta^{\alpha\beta}S_
      {\beta} = \text{invariant scalar}]
Invariant means that it takes the same value in all inertial frames, because it
is a scalar (0 rank tensor), and so no Î appears in its trivial
transformation. The magnitude of the 4-vector T is the positive square root of
the inner product with itself:
          |   T   |  =    T  &#x03B1;    T  &#x03B1;       {\displaystyle
      |\mathbf {T} |={\sqrt {T^{\alpha }T_{\alpha }}}}  [|\mathbf{T}| = \sqrt
      {T^{\alpha}T_{\alpha}}]
One can extend this idea to tensors of higher order, for a second order tensor
we can form the invariants:
          T  &#x03B1;       &#x03B1;   ,  T  &#x03B1;       &#x03B2;    T
      &#x03B2;       &#x03B1;   ,  T  &#x03B1;       &#x03B2;    T  &#x03B2;
      &#x03B3;    T  &#x03B3;       &#x03B1;   =  invariant scalars  ,
      {\displaystyle T^{\alpha }{}_{\alpha },T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }T^{\beta }
      {}_{\alpha },T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }T^{\beta }{}_{\gamma }T^{\gamma }{}_
      {\alpha }={\text{invariant scalars}},}  [{\displaystyle T^{\alpha }{}_
      {\alpha },T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }T^{\beta }{}_{\alpha },T^{\alpha }{}_
      {\beta }T^{\beta }{}_{\gamma }T^{\gamma }{}_{\alpha }={\text{invariant
      scalars}},}]
similarly for higher order tensors. Invariant expressions, particularly inner
products of 4-vectors with themselves, provide equations that are useful for
calculations, because one doesn't need to perform Lorentz transformations to
determine the invariants.
*** Relativistic kinematics and invariance[edit] ***
The coordinate differentials transform also contravariantly:
         d  X   &#x03BC; &#x2032;    =  &#x039B;   &#x03BC; &#x2032;
      &#x03BD;   d  X  &#x03BD;     {\displaystyle dX^{\mu '}=\Lambda ^{\mu '}
      {}_{\nu }dX^{\nu }}  [dX^{\mu'}=\Lambda^{\mu'}{}_\nu dX^\nu]
so the squared length of the differential of the position four-vector dXÎ¼
constructed using
         d   X   2   = d  X  &#x03BC;    d  X  &#x03BC;   =  &#x03B7;  &#x03BC;
      &#x03BD;    d  X  &#x03BC;    d  X  &#x03BD;   = &#x2212; ( c d t  )  2
      + ( d x  )  2   + ( d y  )  2   + ( d z  )  2      {\displaystyle
      d\mathbf {X} ^{2}=dX^{\mu }\,dX_{\mu }=\eta _{\mu \nu }\,dX^{\mu }\,dX^
      {\nu }=-(cdt)^{2}+(dx)^{2}+(dy)^{2}+(dz)^{2}\,}  [d\mathbf{X}^2 = dX^\mu
      \,dX_\mu = \eta_{\mu\nu}\,dX^\mu \,dX^\nu = -(c dt)^2+(dx)^2+(dy)^2+
      (dz)^2\,]
is an invariant. Notice that when the line_element dX2 is negative that √âdX2
is the differential of proper_time, while when dX2 is positive, √dX2 is
differential of the proper_distance.
The 4-velocity UÎ¼ has an invariant form:
            U    2   =  &#x03B7;  &#x03BD; &#x03BC;    U  &#x03BD;    U
      &#x03BC;   = &#x2212;  c  2    ,   {\displaystyle {\mathbf {U} }^{2}=\eta
      _{\nu \mu }U^{\nu }U^{\mu }=-c^{2}\,,}  [{\mathbf U}^2 = \eta_{\nu\mu}
      U^\nu U^\mu = -c^2 \,,]
which means all velocity four-vectors have a magnitude of c. This is an
expression of the fact that there is no such thing as being at coordinate rest
in relativity: at the least, you are always moving forward through time.
Differentiating the above equation by Ï produces:
         2  &#x03B7;  &#x03BC; &#x03BD;    A  &#x03BC;    U  &#x03BD;   = 0.
      {\displaystyle 2\eta _{\mu \nu }A^{\mu }U^{\nu }=0.}  [2\eta_
      {\mu\nu}A^\mu U^\nu = 0.]
So in special relativity, the acceleration four-vector and the velocity four-
vector are orthogonal.
*** Relativistic dynamics and invariance[edit] ***
The invariant magnitude of the momentum_4-vector generates the
energyâmomentum_relation:
           P   2   =  &#x03B7;  &#x03BC; &#x03BD;    P  &#x03BC;    P  &#x03BD;
      = &#x2212;   (   E c   )   2   +  p  2   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^
      {2}=\eta ^{\mu \nu }P_{\mu }P_{\nu }=-\left({\frac {E}{c}}\right)^{2}+p^
      {2}.}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{2}=\eta ^{\mu \nu }P_{\mu }P_{\nu
      }=-\left({\frac {E}{c}}\right)^{2}+p^{2}.}]
We can work out what this invariant is by first arguing that, since it is a
scalar, it doesn't matter in which reference frame we calculate it, and then by
transforming to a frame where the total momentum is zero.
           P   2   = &#x2212;   (    E   r e s t    c   )   2   = &#x2212; ( m
      c  )  2   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{2}=-\left({\frac {E_{\mathrm
      {rest} }}{c}}\right)^{2}=-(mc)^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{2}=-
      \left({\frac {E_{\mathrm {rest} }}{c}}\right)^{2}=-(mc)^{2}.}]
We see that the rest energy is an independent invariant. A rest energy can be
calculated even for particles and systems in motion, by translating to a frame
in which momentum is zero.
The rest energy is related to the mass according to the celebrated equation
discussed above:
          E   r e s t    = m  c  2   .   {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {rest} }=mc^
      {2}.}  [E_\mathrm{rest} = m c^2.]
Note that the mass of systems measured in their center of momentum frame (where
total momentum is zero) is given by the total energy of the system in this
frame. It may not be equal to the sum of individual system masses measured in
other frames.
To use Newton's_third_law_of_motion, both forces must be defined as the rate of
change of momentum with respect to the same time coordinate. That is, it
requires the 3D force defined above. Unfortunately, there is no tensor in 4D
which contains the components of the 3D force vector among its components.
If a particle is not traveling at c, one can transform the 3D force from the
particle's co-moving reference frame into the observer's reference frame. This
yields a 4-vector called the four-force. It is the rate of change of the above
energy momentum four-vector with respect to proper time. The covariant version
of the four-force is:
          F  &#x03BD;   =    d  P  &#x03BD;     d &#x03C4;    = m  A  &#x03BD;
      {\displaystyle F_{\nu }={\frac {dP_{\nu }}{d\tau }}=mA_{\nu }}  [F_\nu =
      \frac{d P_{\nu}}{d \tau} = m A_\nu ]
In the rest frame of the object, the time component of the four force is zero
unless the "invariant_mass" of the object is changing (this requires a non-
closed system in which energy/mass is being directly added or removed from the
object) in which case it is the negative of that rate of change of mass, times
c. In general, though, the components of the four force are not equal to the
components of the three-force, because the three force is defined by the rate
of change of momentum with respect to coordinate time, i.e. dp/dt while the
four force is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to proper
time, i.e. dp/dÏ.
In a continuous medium, the 3D density of force combines with the density of
power to form a covariant 4-vector. The spatial part is the result of dividing
the force on a small cell (in 3-space) by the volume of that cell. The time
component is â1/c times the power transferred to that cell divided by the
volume of the cell. This will be used below in the section on electromagnetism.

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ Einstein himself, in The Foundations of the General Theory of
      Relativity, Ann. Phys. 49 (1916), writes "The word "special" is meant to
      intimate that the principle is restricted to the case...". See p. 111 of
      The Principle of Relativity, A. Einstein, H. A. Lorentz, H. Weyl, H.
      Minkowski, Dover reprint of 1923 translation by Methuen and Company.]
   2. ^ Wald, General Relativity, p. 60: "...the special theory of relativity
      asserts that spacetime is the manifold â4 with a flat metric of Lorentz
      signature defined on it. Conversely, the entire content of special
      relativity ... is contained in this statement ..."
   3. ^ In a spacetime setting, the length of a rigid object is the spatial
      distance between the ends of the object measured at the same time.
   4. ^ The results of the MichelsonâMorley_experiment led George_Francis
      FitzGerald and Hendrik_Lorentz independently to propose the phenomenon of
      length_contraction. Lorentz believed that length contraction represented
      a physical contraction of the atoms making up an object. He envisioned no
      fundamental change in the nature of space and time.[21]:62â68
           Lorentz expected that length contraction would result in compressive
      strains in an object that should result in measurable effects. Such
      effects would include optical effects in transparent media, such as
      optical rotation[p_11] and induction of double refraction,[p_12] and the
      induction of torques on charged condensers moving at an angle with
      respect to the aether.[p_12] Lorentz was perplexed by experiments such as
      the TroutonâNoble_experiment and the experiments_of_Rayleigh_and_Brace
      which failed to validate his theoretical expectations.[21]
   5. ^ For mathematical consistency, Lorentz proposed a new time variable, the
      "local time", called that because it depended on the position of a moving
      body, following the relation      t &#x2032;  = t &#x2212; v x  /   c  2
      {\displaystyle t'=t-vx/c^{2}}  [{\displaystyle t'=t-vx/c^{2}}].[p_13]
      Lorentz considered local time not to be "real"; rather, it represented an
      ad hoc change of variable.[22]:51,80
           Impressed by Lorentz's "most ingenious idea", PoincarÃ© saw more in
      local time than a mere mathematical trick. It represented the actual time
      that would be shown on a moving observer's clocks. On the other hand,
      PoincarÃ© did not consider this measured time to be the "true time" that
      would be exhibited by clocks at rest in the aether. PoincarÃ© made no
      attempt to redefine the concepts of space and time. To PoincarÃ©, Lorentz
      transformation described the apparent states of the field for a moving
      observer. True states remained those defined with respect to the ether.
      [23]
   6. ^ This concept is counterintuitive at least for the fact that, in
      contrast to usual concepts of distance, it may assume negative values (is
      not positive_definite for non-coinciding events), and that the square-
      denotation is misleading. This negative square lead to, now not broadly
      used, concepts of imaginary_time. It is immediate that the negative of
      &#x0394;  s  2     {\displaystyle \Delta s^{2}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
      s^{2}}] is also an invariant, generated by a variant of the metric
      signature of spacetime.
   7. ^ The invariance of Îs2 under standard Lorentz transformation in
      analogous to the invariance of squared distances Îr2 under rotations in
      Euclidean space. Although space and time have an equal footing in
      relativity, the minus sign in front of the spatial terms marks space and
      time as being of essentially different character. They are not the same.
      Because it treats time differently than it treats the 3 spatial
      dimensions, Minkowski_space differs from four-dimensional_Euclidean
      space.
   8. ^ The refractive index dependence of the presumed partial aether-drag was
      eventually confirmed by Pieter_Zeeman in 1914â1915, long after special
      relativity had been accepted by the mainstream. Using a scaled-up version
      of Michelson's apparatus connected directly to Amsterdam's main water
      conduit, Zeeman was able to perform extended measurements using
      monochromatic light ranging from violet (4358 Ã) through red (6870 Ã).
      [p_17][p_18]
   9. ^ Even though it has been many decades since Terrell and Penrose
      published their observations, popular writings continue to conflate
      measurement versus appearance. For example, Michio Kaku wrote in
      Einstein's Cosmos (W. W. Norton & Company, 2004. p. 65): "... imagine
      that the speed of light is only 20 miles per hour. If a car were to go
      down the street, it might look compressed in the direction of motion,
      being squeezed like an accordion down to perhaps 1 inch in length."
  10. ^ In a letter to Carl Seelig in 1955, Einstein wrote "I had already
      previously found that Maxwell's theory did not account for the micro-
      structure of radiation and could therefore have no general validity.",
      Einstein letter to Carl Seelig, 1955.
