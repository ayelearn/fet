Quantum particle having no known substructure

Elementary particles included in the Standard_Model
In particle_physics, an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a
subatomic_particle with no sub structure, thus not composed of other particles.
[1] Particles currently thought to be elementary include the fundamental
fermions (quarks, leptons, antiquarks, and antileptons), which generally are
"matter particles" and "antimatter particles", as well as the fundamental
bosons (gauge_bosons and the Higgs_boson), which generally are "force
particles" that mediate interactions among fermions.[1] A particle containing
two or more elementary particles is a composite_particle.
Everyday_matter is composed of atoms, once presumed to be matter's elementary
particlesÃ¢Â€Â”atom meaning "unable to cut" in GreekÃ¢Â€Â”although the atom's
existence remained controversial until about 1910, as some leading physicists
regarded molecules as mathematical illusions, and matter as ultimately composed
of energy.[1][2] Soon, subatomic constituents of the atom were identified. As
the 1930s opened, the electron and the proton had been discovered, along with
the photon, the particle of electromagnetic_radiation.[1] At that time, the
recent advent of quantum_mechanics was radically altering the conception of
particles, as a single particle could seemingly span a field as_would_a_wave, a
paradox still eluding satisfactory explanation.[3][4]
Via quantum theory, protons and neutrons were found to contain quarksÃ¢Â€Â”up
quarks and down_quarksÃ¢Â€Â”now considered elementary particles.[1] And within a
molecule, the electron's three degrees_of_freedom (charge, spin, orbital) can
separate via the wavefunction into three quasiparticles (holon, spinon,
orbiton).[5] Yet a free electronÃ¢Â€Â”which is not orbiting an atomic_nucleus and
lacks orbital_motionÃ¢Â€Â”appears unsplittable and remains regarded as an
elementary particle.[5]
Around 1980, an elementary particle's status as indeed elementaryÃ¢Â€Â”an ultimate
constituent of substanceÃ¢Â€Â”was mostly discarded for a more practical outlook,
[1] embodied in particle physics' Standard_Model, what's known as science's
most experimentally successful theory.[4][6] Many elaborations upon and
theories beyond_the_Standard_Model, including the popular supersymmetry, double
the number of elementary particles by hypothesizing that each known particle
associates with a "shadow" partner far more massive,[7][8] although all such
superpartners remain undiscovered.[6][9] Meanwhile, an elementary boson
mediating gravitationÃ¢Â€Â”the gravitonÃ¢Â€Â”remains hypothetical.[1]

All elementary particles are either bosons or fermions. These classes are
distinguished by their quantum_statistics: fermions obey FermiÃ¢Â€Â“Dirac
statistics and bosons obey BoseÃ¢Â€Â“Einstein_statistics.[1] Their spin is
differentiated via the spinÃ¢Â€Â“statistics_theorem: it is half-integer for
fermions, and integer for bosons.

Notes:
1. The antielectron (
e+
) is traditionally called positron.
2. The known force carrier bosons all have spin = 1 and are therefore vector
bosons. The hypothetical graviton has spin = 2 and is a tensor boson; whether
it is a gauge boson as well, is unknown.
In the Standard_Model, elementary particles are represented for predictive
utility as point_particles. Though extremely successful, the Standard Model is
limited to the microcosm by its omission of gravitation and has some parameters
arbitrarily added but unexplained.[10]
***** Common elementary particles[edit] *****
Main article: Cosmic_abundance_of_elements
According to the current models of big_bang_nucleosynthesis, the primordial
composition of visible matter of the universe should be about 75% hydrogen and
25% helium-4 (in mass). Neutrons are made up of one up and two down quarks,
while protons are made of two up and one down quark. Since the other common
elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so
light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass
contribution to the observable universe's total mass. Therefore, one can
conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and
neutrons, which, like all baryons, in turn consist of up quarks and down
quarks.
Some estimates imply that there are roughly 1080 baryons (almost entirely
protons and neutrons) in the observable universe.[11][12][13]
The number of protons in the observable universe is called the Eddington
number.
In terms of number of particles, some estimates imply that nearly all the
matter, excluding dark_matter, occurs in neutrinos, which constitute the
majority of the roughly 1086 elementary particles of matter that exist in the
visible universe.[13] Other estimates imply that roughly 1097 elementary
particles exist in the visible universe (not including dark_matter), mostly
photons and other massless force carriers.[13]
***** Standard Model[edit] *****
Main article: Standard_Model
The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary
fermions, plus their corresponding antiparticles, as well as elementary bosons
that mediate the forces and the Higgs_boson, which was reported on July 4,
2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the Large
Hadron_Collider (ATLAS and CMS). However, the Standard Model is widely
considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one,
since it is not known if it is compatible with Einstein's general_relativity.
There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard
Model, such as the graviton, the particle that would carry the gravitational
force, and sparticles, supersymmetric partners of the ordinary particles.
**** Fundamental fermions[edit] ****
Main article: Fermion
The 12Â fundamental fermions are divided into 3Â generations of 4Â particles each.
Half of the fermions are leptons, three of which have an electric charge of âˆ’1,
called the electron (
eâˆ’
), the muon (
Î¼âˆ’
), and the tau (
Ï„âˆ’
), the other three leptons are neutrinos (
Î½
e,
Î½
Î¼,
Î½
Ï„), which are the only elementary fermions with no electric or color charge.
The remaining six particles are quarks (discussed below).

The following table lists current measured masses and mass estimates for all
the fermions, using the same scale of measure: millions_of_electron-volts
relative to square of light speed (MeV/cÃ‚Â²). For example, the most accurately
known quark mass is of the top quark (

Estimates of the values of quark masses depend on the version of quantum
chromodynamics used to describe quark interactions. Quarks are always confined
in an envelope of gluons which confer vastly greater mass to the mesons and
baryons where quarks occur, so values for quark masses cannot be measured
directly. Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the
surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large
differences in the masses.
*** Antiparticles[edit] ***
Main article: Antimatter
There are also 12Â fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond to these
12Â particles. For example, the antielectron (positron)

e+
 is the electron's antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1.

*** Quarks[edit] ***
Main article: Quark
Isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by
confinement. Every quark carries one of three color_charges of the strong
interaction; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles
interact via gluon exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via
photon exchange. However, gluons are themselves color-charged, resulting in an
amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated.
Unlike the electromagnetic_force, which diminishes as charged particles
separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.
However, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral composite
particles called hadrons. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has
a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and
anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral meson. Alternatively, three
quarks can exist together, one quark being "red", another "blue", another
"green". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral baryon.
Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors "antired", "antiblue" and
"antigreen" can form a color-neutral antibaryon.
Quarks also carry fractional electric_charges, but, since they are confined
within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never
been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either +&#x200b;2â„3 or
Ã¢ÂˆÂ’&#x200b;1â„3, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of
either Ã¢ÂˆÂ’&#x200b;2â„3 or +&#x200b;1â„3.
Evidence for the existence of quarks comes from deep_inelastic_scattering:
firing electrons at nuclei to determine the distribution of charge within
nucleons (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the electric_field
around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter
elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a
particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The
recoiling electron has much less energy and a jet_of_particles is emitted. This
inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but
split among smaller charged particles: quarks.
**** Fundamental bosons[edit] ****
Main article: Boson
In the Standard Model, vector (spin-1) bosons (gluons, photons, and the W_and_Z
bosons) mediate forces, whereas the Higgs_boson (spin-0) is responsible for the
intrinsic mass of particles. Bosons differ from fermions in the fact that
multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state (Pauli_exclusion_principle).
Also, bosons can be either elementary, like photons, or a combination, like
mesons. The spin of bosons are integers instead of half integers.
*** Gluons[edit] ***
Main article: Gluon
Gluons mediate the strong_interaction, which join quarks and thereby form
hadrons, which are either baryons (three quarks) or mesons (one quark and one
antiquark). Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the
atomic_nucleus. Like quarks, gluons exhibit color and anticolorÃ¢Â€Â”unrelated to
the concept of visual colorÃ¢Â€Â”sometimes in combinations, altogether eight
variations of gluons.
*** Electroweak bosons[edit] ***
Main articles: W_and_Z_bosons and Photon
There are three weak_gauge_bosons: W+, WÃ¢ÂˆÂ’, and Z0; these mediate the weak
interaction. The W bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay. The
WÃ¢ÂˆÂ’ converts a neutron into a proton then decay into an electron and electron
antineutrino pair. The Z0 does not convert charge but rather changes momentum
and is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge
bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-
Z exchange. The massless photon mediates the electromagnetic_interaction. These
four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles.
*** Higgs boson[edit] ***
Main article: Higgs_boson
Although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at
everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to unify as a single
electroweak_force at high energies. This prediction was clearly confirmed by
measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at
the HERA collider at DESY. The differences at low energies is a consequence of
the high masses of the W and Z bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the
Higgs_mechanism. Through the process of spontaneous_symmetry_breaking, the
Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three
electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain
with an undefined rest mass as it is always in motion (the photon). On 4 July
2012, after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its
existence, the Higgs_boson was announced to have been observed at CERN's Large
Hadron Collider. Peter_Higgs who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson
was present at the announcement.[14] The Higgs boson is believed to have a mass
of approximately 125 GeV.[15] The statistical_significance of this discovery
was reported as 5-sigma, which implies a certainty of roughly 99.99994%. In
particle physics, this is the level of significance required to officially
label experimental observations as a discovery. Research into the properties of
the newly discovered particle continues.
*** Graviton[edit] ***
Main article: Graviton
The graviton is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate
gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to the_difficulty_inherent_in
its_detection, it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles.[1]
The conventional graviton is massless, although there exist models containing
massive KaluzaÃ¢Â€Â“Klein gravitons.[16]
***** Beyond the Standard Model[edit] *****
Although experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived
from the Standard_Model, some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not
determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysterious, for instance
the hierarchy_problem. Theories beyond_the_Standard_Model attempt to resolve
these shortcomings.
**** Grand unification[edit] ****
Main article: Grand_Unified_Theory
One extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the electroweak
interaction with the strong_interaction into a single 'grand unified theory'
(GUT). Such a force would be spontaneously_broken into the three forces by a
Higgs-like_mechanism. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the
existence of X_and_Y_bosons, which cause proton_decay. However, the non-
observation of proton decay at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory rules
out the simplest GUTs, including SU(5) and SO(10).
**** Supersymmetry[edit] ****
Main article: Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries
to the Lagrangian. These symmetries exchange fermionic particles with bosonic
ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of supersymmetric_particles,
abbreviated as sparticles, which include the sleptons, squarks, neutralinos,
and charginos. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner
whose spin differs by &#x200b;1â„2 from the ordinary particle. Due to the
breaking_of_supersymmetry, the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary
counterparts; they are so heavy that existing particle_colliders would not be
powerful enough to produce them. However, some physicists believe that
sparticles will be detected by the Large_Hadron_Collider at CERN.
**** String theory[edit] ****
Main article: String_theory
String theory is a model of physics where all "particles" that make up matter
are composed of strings (measuring at the Planck length) that exist in an 11-
dimensional (according to M-theory, the leading version) or 12-dimensional
(according to F-theory[17]) universe. These strings vibrate at different
frequencies that determine mass, electric charge, color charge, and spin. A
string can be open (a line) or closed in a loop (a one-dimensional sphere, like
a circle). As a string moves through space it sweeps out something called a
world_sheet. String theory predicts 1- to 10-branes (a 1-brane being a string
and a 10-brane being a 10-dimensional object) that prevent tears in the
"fabric" of space using the uncertainty_principle (e.g., the electron orbiting
a hydrogen atom has the probability, albeit small, that it could be anywhere
else in the universe at any given moment).
String theory proposes that our universe is merely a 4-brane, inside which
exist the 3 space dimensions and the 1 time dimension that we observe. The
remaining 7 theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled up (and too
small to be macroscopically accessible) or simply do not/cannot exist in our
universe (because they exist in a grander scheme called the "multiverse"
outside our known universe).
Some predictions of the string theory include existence of extremely massive
counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the
fundamental string and existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like
the graviton.
**** Technicolor[edit] ****
Main article: Technicolor_(physics)
Technicolor theories try to modify the Standard Model in a minimal way by
introducing a new QCD-like interaction. This means one adds a new theory of so-
called Techniquarks, interacting via so called Technigluons. The main idea is
that the Higgs-Boson is not an elementary particle but a bound state of these
objects.
**** Preon theory[edit] ****
Main article: Preon
According to preon theory there are one or more orders of particles more
fundamental than those (or most of those) found in the Standard Model. The most
fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from "pre-
quarks". In essence, preon theory tries to do for the Standard Model what the
Standard Model did for the particle_zoo that came before it. Most models assume
that almost everything in the Standard Model can be explained in terms of three
to half a dozen more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their
interactions. Interest in preons has waned since the simplest models were
experimentally ruled out in the 1980s.
**** Acceleron theory[edit] ****
Accelerons are the hypothetical subatomic_particles that integrally link the
newfound mass of the neutrino to the dark_energy conjectured to be accelerating
the expansion_of_the_universe.[18]
In theory, neutrinos are influenced by a new force resulting from their
interactions with accelerons. Dark energy results as the universe tries to pull
neutrinos apart.[18]
