From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
circuit component that outputs the integral of its input over time
      An integrator may also be a systems_integrator.
An integrator in measurement and control applications is an element whose
output signal is the time integral of its input signal. It accumulates the
input quantity over a defined time to produce a representative output.
Integration is an important part of many engineering and scientific
applications. Mechanical integrators are the oldest application, and are still
used in such as metering of water flow or electric power. Electronic analogue
integrators are the basis of analog_computers and charge amplifiers.
Integration is also performed by digital computing algorithms.

***** In signal processing circuits[edit] *****
A circuit diagram of an integrating amplifier made using an operational
amplifier.

An electronic integrator is a form of first-order low-pass_filter, which can be
performed in the continuous-time (analog) domain or approximated (simulated) in
the discrete-time (digital) domain. An integrator will have a low pass
filtering effect but when given an offset it will accumulate a value building
it until it reaches a limit of the system or overflows.
A voltage integrator is an electronic device performing a time integration of
an electric voltage, thus measuring the total volt-second product.
A current integrator is an electronic device performing a time integration of
an electric_current, thus measuring a total electric_charge. A charge_amplifier
is an example of current integrator. A current integrator is also used to
measure the electric charge on a Faraday_cup in a residual_gas_analyzer to
measure partial pressures of gasses in a vacuum. Another application of current
integration is in ion_beam_deposition, where the measured charge directly
corresponds to the number of ions deposited on a substrate, assuming the charge
state of the ions is known. The two current-carrying electrical leads must to
be connected to the ion_source and the substrate, closing the electric_circuit
which in part is given by the ion beam.
***** In software[edit] *****
Main article: Numerical_integration
    * Integrators may also be software components.
    * In some computational_physics computer_simulations, such as numerical
      weather_prediction, molecular_dynamics, flight_simulators, reservoir
      simulation, noise_barrier design, architectural_acoustics, and electronic
      circuit_simulation, an integrator is a numerical method for integrating
      trajectories from forces (and thereby accelerations) that are only
      calculated at discrete time steps.
***** Mechanical integrators[edit] *****
Main article: Differential_analyser
Mechanical integrators were key elements in the mechanical differential
analyser, used to solve practical physical problems. Mechanical integration
mechanisms were also used in control systems such as regulating flows or
temperature in industrial processes. Mechanisms such as the ball-and-disk
integrator were used both for computation in differential analysers and as
components of instruments such as naval_gun_directors, flow totalizers and
others. A planimeter is a mechanical device used for calculating the definite
integral of a curve given in graphical form, or more generally finding the area
of a closed curve. An integraph is used to plot the indefinite integral of a
function given in graphical form.
***** Drawbacks of ideal integrator[edit] *****
    * Bandwidth is very small and used for only small range of input
      frequencies.
    * For dc input (f = 0), the reactance of the capacitance, Xc, is infinite.
      Because of this op-amp goes into open loop configuration.In open loop
      configuration the gain is infinite and hence the small input offset
      voltages are also amplified and appears at output as error. This is
      referred as false triggering and must be avoided. Due to all such
      limitations, an ideal integrator needs to be modified. Some additional
      components are used along with ideal integrator circuit to reduce the
      effect of an error voltage in practice. This modified integrator is
      referred as practical integrator.
***** Practical integrator (lossy integrator)[edit] *****
Frequency response of ideal and practical integrator
The gain of an integrator at low frequency can be limited to avoid the
saturation problem if the feedback capacitor is shunted by a resistor Rf. The
parallel combination of Rf and C behaves like a practical capacitor which
dissipates power, unlike an ideal capacitor. For this reason this circuit is
also called a lossy integrator. The resistor Rf limits the low frequency gain
to (-Rf/R), generally [Rf=10*R1] and thus provides DC stabilisation.
***** Applications[edit] *****
    * Op-amp integrating amplifiers are used to perform calculus operations in
      analogue computers.
    * Integrating circuits are most commonly used in analogue-to-digital
      converters, ramp generators and also in wave shaping applications.
    * Another application would be to integrate a signal representing water
      flow, producing a signal representing the total quantity of water that
      has passed by the flow meter. This application of an integrator is
      sometimes called a totalizer in the industrial instrumentation trade.
