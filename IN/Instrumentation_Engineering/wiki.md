For other uses, see Instrumentation_(disambiguation).
Instrumentation is a collective term for measuring_instruments that are used
for indicating, measuring and recording physical quantities such as flow,
temperature, level, distance, angle, or pressure. The term has its origins in
the art and science of scientific_instrument-making.
Instrumentation can refer to devices as simple as direct-reading thermometers,
or as complex as multi-sensor components of industrial_control_systems. Today,
instruments can be found in laboratories, refineries, factories and vehicles,
as well as in everyday household use (e.g., smoke_detectors and thermostats)

***** History and development[edit] *****

The history of instrumentation can be divide into several phases.
**** Pre-industrial[edit] ****
Elements of industrial instrumentation have long histories. Scales for
comparing weights and simple pointers to indicate position are ancient
technologies. Some of the earliest measurements were of time. One of the oldest
water_clocks was found in the tomb of the ancient_Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep_I,
buried around 1500 BCE.[1] Improvements were incorporated in the clocks. By 270
BCE they had the rudiments of an automatic control system device.[2]
In 1663 Christopher_Wren presented the Royal Society with a design for a
"weather clock". A drawing shows meteorological sensors moving pens over paper
driven by clockwork. Such devices did not become standard in meteorology for
two centuries.[3] The concept has remained virtually unchanged as evidenced by
pneumatic chart recorders, where a pressurized bellows displaces a pen.
Integrating sensors, displays, recorders and controls was uncommon until the
industrial revolution, limited by both need and practicality.
**** Early industrial[edit] ****
The evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic era to the
electronic era
Early systems used direct process connections to local control panels for
control and indication, which from the early 1930s saw the introduction of
pneumatic transmitters and automatic 3-term (PID) controllers.
The ranges of pneumatic transmitters were defined by the need to control valves
and actuators in the field. Typically a signal ranged from 3 to 15 psi (20 to
100kPa or 0.2 to 1.0 kg/cm2) as a standard, was standardized with 6 to 30 psi
occasionally being used for larger valves. Transistor electronics enabled
wiring to replace pipes, initially with a range of 20 to 100mA at up to 90V for
loop powered devices, reducing to 4 to 20mA at 12 to 24V in more modern
systems. A transmitter is a device that produces an output signal, often in the
form of a 4–20 mA electrical current signal, although many other options using
voltage, frequency, pressure, or ethernet are possible. The transistor was
commercialized by the mid-1950s.[4]
Instruments attached to a control system provided signals used to operate
solenoids, valves, regulators, circuit_breakers, relays and other devices. Such
devices could control a desired output variable, and provide either remote or
automated control capabilities.
Each instrument company introduced their own standard instrumentation signal,
causing confusion until the 4-20 mA range was used as the standard electronic
instrument signal for transmitters and valves. This signal was eventually
standardized as ANSI/ISA S50, âCompatibility of Analog Signals for Electronic
Industrial Process Instruments", in the 1970s. The transformation of
instrumentation from mechanical pneumatic transmitters, controllers, and valves
to electronic instruments reduced maintenance costs as electronic instruments
were more dependable than mechanical instruments. This also increased
efficiency and production due to their increase in accuracy. Pneumatics enjoyed
some advantages, being favored in corrosive and explosive atmospheres.[5]
**** Automatic process control[edit] ****
Example of a single industrial control loop, showing continuously modulated
control of process flow
In the early years of process_control, process indicators and control elements
such as valves were monitored by an operator that walked around the unit
adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures, pressures, and flows.
As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the
field that monitored the process and controlled the valves. This reduced the
amount of time process operators were needed to monitor the process. Later
years the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent
into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to
the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed.
These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board.
The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring
the process indicators. This again reduced the number and amount of time
process operators were needed to walk around the units. The most standard
pneumatic signal level used during these years was 3-15 psig.[6]
**** Large integrated computer-based systems[edit] ****
Pneumatic "three term" pneumatic PID_controller, widely used before electronics
became reliable and cheaper and safe to use in hazardous areas (Siemens
Telepneu Example)
A pre-DCS/SCADA era central control room. Whilst the controls are centralised
in one place, they are still discrete and not integrated into one system.
A DCS control room where plant information and controls are displayed on
computer graphics screens. The operators are seated and can view and control
any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages.
Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However
this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels,
and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was
the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central
control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised
panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the
process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all
automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant.
However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was
inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual
operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts
of the process. With coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it
became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based
algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control
processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the
graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control concept
was born.
The introduction of DCSs and SCADA allowed easy interconnection and re-
configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy
interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated
alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for
physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be
networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and
provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.
***** Applications[edit] *****
In some cases the sensor is a very minor element of the mechanism. Digital
cameras and wristwatches might technically meet the loose definition of
instrumentation because they record and/or display sensed information. Under
most circumstances neither would be called instrumentation, but when used to
measure the elapsed time of a race and to document the winner at the finish
line, both would be called instrumentation.
**** Household[edit] ****
A very simple example of an instrumentation system is a mechanical thermostat,
used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A
typical unit senses temperature with a bi-metallic_strip. It displays
temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace
by a mercury_switch. As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes
physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.
Another example of an instrumentation system is a home_security_system. Such a
system consists of sensors (motion detection, switches to detect door
openings), simple algorithms to detect intrusion, local control (arm/disarm)
and remote monitoring of the system so that the police can be summoned.
Communication is an inherent part of the design.
Kitchen appliances use sensors for control.
    * A refrigerator maintains a constant temperature by measuring the internal
      temperature.
    * A microwave oven sometimes cooks via a heat-sense-heat-sense cycle until
      sensing done.
    * An automatic ice machine makes ice until a limit_switch is thrown.
    * Pop-up bread toasters can operate by time or by heat measurements.
    * Some ovens use a temperature probe to cook until a target internal food
      temperature is reached.
    * A common toilet refills the water tank until a float closes the valve.
      The float is acting as a water level sensor.
**** Automotive[edit] ****
Modern automobiles have complex instrumentation. In addition to displays of
engine rotational speed and vehicle linear speed, there are also displays of
battery voltage and current, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, distance
traveled and feedbacks of various controls (turn signals, parking brake,
headlights, transmission position). Cautions may be displayed for special
problems (fuel low, check engine, tire pressure low, door ajar, seat belt
unfastened). Problems are recorded so they can be reported to diagnostic
equipment. Navigation systems can provide voice commands to reach a
destination. Automotive instrumentation must be cheap and reliable over long
periods in harsh environments. There may be independent airbag systems which
contain sensors, logic and actuators. Anti-skid braking systems use sensors to
control the brakes, while cruise_control affects throttle position. A wide
variety of services can be provided via communication links as the OnStar
system. Autonomous_cars (with exotic instrumentation) have been demonstrated.
**** Aircraft[edit] ****
Early aircraft had a few sensors.[7] "Steam gauges" converted air pressures
into needle deflections that could be interpreted as altitude and airspeed. A
magnetic compass provided a sense of direction. The displays to the pilot were
as critical as the measurements.
A modern aircraft has a far more sophisticated suite of sensors and displays,
which are embedded into avionics systems. The aircraft may contain inertial
navigation_systems, global_positioning_systems, weather_radar, autopilots, and
aircraft stabilization systems. Redundant sensors are used for reliability. A
subset of the information may be transferred to a crash_recorder to aid mishap
investigations. Modern pilot displays now include computer displays including
head-up_displays.
Air_traffic_control_radar is distributed instrumentation system. The ground
portion transmits an electromagnetic pulse and receives an echo (at least).
Aircraft carry transponders that transmit codes on reception of the pulse. The
system displays aircraft map location, an identifier and optionally altitude.
The map location is based on sensed antenna direction and sensed time delay.
The other information is embedded in the transponder transmission.
**** Laboratory instrumentation[edit] ****
Among the possible uses of the term is a collection of laboratory test
equipment controlled by a computer through an IEEE-488 bus (also known as GPIB
for General Purpose Instrument Bus or HPIB for Hewlitt Packard Instrument Bus).
Laboratory equipment is available to measure many electrical and chemical
quantities. Such a collection of equipment might be used to automate the
testing of drinking water for pollutants.
***** Measurement parameters[edit] *****
Instrumentation is used to measure many parameters (physical values). These
parameters include:
    * Pressure, either                                       * Chemical
      differential or      * Viscosity                         composition
      static               * ionising      * Voltage         * Chemical
    * Flow                   radiation     * Inductance        properties
    * Temperature          * Frequency     * Capacitance     * Position
    * Levels of            * Current       * Resistivity     * Vibration
      liquids, etc.                                          * Weight
    * Density

***** Instrumentation engineering[edit] *****
The instrumentation part of a piping_and_instrumentation_diagram will be
developed by an instrumentation engineer.
Instrumentation engineering is the engineering specialization focused on the
principle and operation of measuring instruments that are used in design and
configuration of automated systems in electrical, pneumatic domains etc and the
control of quantities being measured. They typically work for industries with
automated processes, such as chemical or manufacturing plants, with the goal of
improving system productivity, reliability, safety, optimization and stability.
To control the parameters in a process or in a particular system, devices such
as microprocessors, microcontrollers or PLCs are used, but their ultimate aim
is to control the parameters of a system.
Instrumentation engineering is loosely defined because the required tasks are
very domain dependent. An expert in the biomedical instrumentation of
laboratory rats has very different concerns than the expert in rocket
instrumentation. Common concerns of both are the selection of appropriate
sensors based on size, weight, cost, reliability, accuracy, longevity,
environmental robustness and frequency response. Some sensors are literally
fired in artillery shells. Others sense thermonuclear explosions until
destroyed. Invariably sensor data must be recorded, transmitted or displayed.
Recording rates and capacities vary enormously. Transmission can be trivial or
can be clandestine, encrypted and low-power in the presence of jamming.
Displays can be trivially simple or can require consultation with human_factors
experts. Control system design varies from trivial to a separate specialty.
Instrumentation engineers are responsible for integrating the sensors with the
recorders, transmitters, displays or control systems, and producing the Piping
and_instrumentation_diagram for the process. They may design or specify
installation, wiring and signal conditioning. They may be responsible for
calibration, testing and maintenance of the system.
In a research environment it is common for subject matter experts to have
substantial instrumentation system expertise. An astronomer knows the structure
of the universe and a great deal about telescopes - optics, pointing and
cameras (or other sensing elements). That often includes the hard-won knowledge
of the operational procedures that provide the best results. For example, an
astronomer is often knowledgeable of techniques to minimize temperature
gradients that cause air turbulence within the telescope.
Instrumentation technologists, technicians and mechanics specialize in
troubleshooting, repairing and maintaining instruments and instrumentation
systems.
**** Typical industrial transmitter signal types[edit] ****
    * Current_loop_(4-20mA) - Electrical
    * HART - Data signalling, often overlaid on a current loop
    * Foundation_Fieldbus - Data signalling
    * Profibus - Data signalling
***** Impact of modern development[edit] *****
Ralph MÃ¼ller (1940) stated, "That the history of physical science is largely
the history of instruments and their intelligent use is well known. The broad
generalizations and theories which have arisen from time to time have stood or
fallen on the basis of accurate measurement, and in several instances new
instruments have had to be devised for the purpose. There is little evidence to
show that the mind of modern man is superior to that of the ancients. His tools
are incomparably better."[8][9]:290
Davis Baird has argued that the major change associated with Floris_Cohen's
identification of a "fourth big scientific revolution" after World_War_II is
the development of scientific instrumentation, not only in chemistry but across
the sciences.[9][10] In chemistry, the introduction of new instrumentation in
the 1940s was "nothing less than a scientific and technological revolution"
[11]:28â29 in which classical wet-and-dry methods of structural organic
chemistry were discarded, and new areas of research opened up.[11]:38
As early as 1954, W. A. Wildhack discussed both the productive and destructive
potential inherent in process control.[12] The ability to make precise,
verifiable and reproducible measurements of the natural world, at levels that
were not previously observable, using scientific instrumentation, has "provided
a different texture of the world".[13] This instrumentation revolution
fundamentally changes human abilities to monitor and respond, as is illustrated
in the examples of DDT monitoring and the use of UV_spectrophotometry and gas
chromatography to monitor water_pollutants.[10][13]
