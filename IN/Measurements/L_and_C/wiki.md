Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is an American television series
based on the DC Comics character Superman created by Jerry_Siegel and Joe
Shuster. It stars Dean_Cain as Clark_Kent/Superman and Teri_Hatcher as Lois
Lane. The series aired on ABC from September 12, 1993 to June 14, 1997.[1]
Developed for television by Deborah_Joy_LeVine,[2] the series loosely followed
the modern_origin of Superman, established by writer John_Byrne, where Clark
Kent is the true personality and Superman a disguise. The series focuses on the
relationship and romance between Lois and Clark as much as the adventures of
Clark's alter-ego, Superman.[3]

***** Overview[edit] *****
On May 17, 1966, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Eddie_Jones and K._Callan) witness
the crash-landing of a small spaceship in Shuster's Field outside of
Smallville, Kansas. When they investigate, they discover the baby Kal-El and
decide to raise him as their own naming him, Clark Jerome Kent (Dean_Cain).
Throughout the series, Clark proudly states his mother made his Superman
costume for him. Clark often consults his parents either by telephone or in
person, after impromptu Superman flights to Smallville, about personal and
moral concerns and dilemmas.
The series opens twenty-seven years later, on the day Clark moves to Metropolis
after leaving his position as a newspaper editor of Smallville Press and
interviews for a job at the Daily_Planet under editor Perry White (Lane_Smith).
Clark becomes acquainted with photographer Jimmy Olsen (Michael_Landes in
season 1, Justin_Whalin thereafter) and gossip columnist Cat Grant (Tracy
Scoggins). Soon after being hired, Clark is partnered with star reporter Lois
Lane (Teri_Hatcher). Clark falls in love with Lois at first sight. When
Superman saves Lois from a space shuttle disaster, she instantly becomes
infatuated with Clark's alter-ego and named him Superman.
Superman's first mission interferes with the illegal dealings of Lex Luthor
(John_Shea), a Metropolis business giant and benefactor. After Luthor's plot
was stopped, Superman let Luthor know he is watching him and the two become
arch-enemies. However, Clark respects Luthor's life, even surreptitiously using
his superpowers to save Lex from bleeding to death. Luthor sees Superman as a
worthy opponent; he ultimately discovers his weakness to kryptonite and
realizes he has a secret identity, vowing to learn it in hopes of making the
hero's life difficult.
***** Production[edit] *****
Teri_Hatcher and Dean_Cain
DC Comics president Jenette_Kahn had been working for several years to sell the
concept of a Superman television series. The series would be different. In 1991
Leslie_Moonves and Deborah_Joy_LeVine helped sell the series to ABC television
network with a new title, Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.[4]
The series mirrored John_Byrne's reboot of Superman, making Clark Kent more
assertive and less clumsy. A few episodes directly emphasized that Clark was
the unequivocal dominant personality, not Superman. Following this theme, an
innovation unique to the series was the depiction of Clark Kent and Superman's
traditional hairstyles being reversedâhere it is Superman whose hair is
slicked-back, and Clark whose fringe falls more naturally. An additional
element that reflected the post-Byrne comics was the portrayal of Lex Luthor
(at least initially) as a corrupt corporate tycoon, rather than the traditional
mad scientist.
Many of the stories in season one involved normal human criminals using
advanced and powerful technology or involved in large and dangerous
conspiraciesâmost, if not all, of the Lex Luthor stories of season one. After
season one, series creator Deborah Joy LeVine left the show as a producer, and
a new production team took over the series. Episode plots gradually shifted
from those in which Lois, Clark, and Superman only became involved with
criminal elements or dangerous situations through their own initiative to more
fantastic plots. The show often centered on comic-style villains who
specifically targeted Lois, Superman, or Clark from the beginning, rather than
endangering the protagonists as a reactionary measure when they became threats
to other criminal plans. Later plots frequently revolved around villains with
special superhuman powers and abilities.
A fifth season of the series was initially announced by ABC. When the network
unexpectedly canceled plans for season five, the producers and writers of the
show were unprepared. The series ended on a cliffhanger where Clark and Lois
find an infant in their home with a note saying the child belongs to them. This
mystery was never solved on the series.

**** Season one[edit] ****
John_Shea as Lex_Luthor
Teri_Hatcher and Dean_Cain received critical praise for their performances.[5]
[6] Lane_Smith breathed life and humor into the Daily Planet editor-in-chief
Perry White and John Shea received positive reviews for his portrayal of Lex
Luthor. Michael Landes portrayed a modern-day Jimmy Olsen and Tracy Scoggins a
comedic portrayal of Cat Grant. Lex Luthor's death in the season finale
occurred after disagreements between Shea and the producers over the actor's
strenuous commute between New York and Los Angeles. No longer a regular cast
member, he reappeared once in season two, twice in season three, and once in
season four.[7]
Luthor develops an interest in Lois Lane and through most of the first season
tries to woo her; although Lois is receptive to his romantic advances, she
remains infatuated with Superman. Lois also develops feelings for Clark, but
represses or denies them. Luthor eventually proposes marriage to Lois. Clark,
seeing he may lose Lois, attempts to convince her of Luthor's true nature, but
fails. In a last-ditch attempt, Clark tells Lois that he is in love with her;
she replies that she does not return his feelings but cares for him deeply as a
friend. Later, Lois asks Superman if there is any chance of a romance between
the two of them. Superman turns her down and Lois accepts Luthor's proposal.
Luthor decides to coincide his nuptials with the death of Superman, whom he
traps in a kryptonite cage in the wine cellar of Luthor Tower, which also
contains the chapel where the wedding will occur. As the wedding approaches,
Lois realizes she loves Clark and says no to Lex at the altar.
Clark had been working with Perry and Jimmy to expose Lex and they have enough
evidence for the police to interrupt the wedding. Lex eludes the police and
jumps from his penthouse office to his apparent death. Superman has escaped the
cage and, as Clark, rejoins Lois. However, his powers have been diminished by
kryptonite and he cannot stop the villain from falling to the pavement.
Newspapers report that Lex's body has been stolen from the morgue and hint he
may not be dead. Clark, fearing his unrequited love for Lois may damage their
relationship, tells her his profession of love was only out of a desire to
protect her from Lex. Lois, who was about to tell Clark that she loves him too,
instead keeps it to herself and their relationship remains a friendship.
**** Season two[edit] ****
In season two, the character of Cat Grant was dropped, and Michael Landes was
replaced with Justin Whalin as Jimmy Olsen. The official reason, according to
Landes, was that he looked too similar to Dean Cain.[8] On the show, the
explanation is that he has changed with age. Series creator Deborah_Joy_LeVine
and the entire first-season writing team were also dismissed. The new producer,
Robert Singer, planned a stronger focus on action;[9] the show also shifted its
focus onto the budding romance between Lois and Clark.
Lex Luthor returned in one episode and other villains from the comics, such as
The_Prankster, Metallo, the_Toyman and the criminal group known as Intergang,
began to appear. This season also featured the debut of fan-favorite villain
Tempus (Lane_Davies) and H._G._Wells appeared as a time-traveler. Wells'
younger self was played by Terry_Kiser, and the older Wells was played by
Hamilton_Camp.
During the season, Clark and Lois begin to consider dating but are interrupted
by Mayson Drake (Farrah_Forke), a district_attorney who takes a romantic
interest in Clark but has a total lack of regard for Superman. Mayson dies as
Lois and Clark have their first date. In the next episode, a federal agent
named Dan Scardino (Jim Pirri) becomes a rival to Clark for Lois' affections.
After initially spurning Dan, Lois decides to date Dan when Clark frequently
has to suddenly leave their talks or get-togethers to save other people (as
Superman) but offers ridiculous reasons for why he had to suddenly depart. Lois
eventually decides she has more feelings for Clark than for Dan, and they begin
dating more seriously. In the season finale, Clark comes close to telling Lois
his secret but does not, first because of his uncertainty about her reaction,
and then interruptions by people plotting to expose his identity to the world.
At the end of the final episode, Clark proposes to Lois but Lois' response is
left as a cliffhanger for the next season. Season two became a success and
garnered higher ratings in its initial airings, ending the season in 58th
place.
**** Season three[edit] ****
Season three averaged around 15 million viewers per episode and ranked 44th for
the season. In the premiere episode, in responding to Clark's marriage
proposal, Lois reveals that she knows Clark's secret identity and expresses
concern about how she can trust him when he has kept that secret from her for
so long. They spend more time together and after having a few disagreements
which then get resolved with them being even closer, she accepts Clark's
proposal in the seventh episode, "Ultra Woman." ABC announced that the wedding
would occur on Valentine's Day weekend; with ABC sending heart-shaped "wedding
invitations" to ABC News staff. A controversy erupted, when ABC presents the
viewers with a bogus wedding, with Clark unwittingly married to a clone of
Lois.[10] This was the start of a five-part story, in which Lois is kidnapped
by Lex Luthor, replaced by a clone, the real Lois suffering from amnesia, and
Clark trying to find the real Lois Lane.
In the third season premiere, Lois has discovered Superman's secret identity.
Initially, she resents Clark not telling her. After they separate for a time,
Lois dates Patrick Sullivan, an antique dealer who is plotting to kill her in a
sacrificial druid ritual, and she and Clark carry out assignments where they
either pose as a married couple or are alone together for an entire weekend.
Lois finally accepts Clark's engagement ring after acquiring his powers and
temporarily becoming a superhero named Ultra Woman. Lois suffers a bout of
amnesia and hallucinates their wedding. Once she recovers, Lois and Clark are
still engaged when two other Kryptonians come to Earth, one of whom is Clark's
wife. They insist Clark go with them to save their world, New Krypton, from
domination by an evil tyrant named Lord Nor; Clark leaves Lois, taking her
wedding ring to remember her and as a promise to return as quickly as possible.
While committed to each other, they both doubt he will ever return.
**** Season four[edit] ****
Lane_Smith as Perry_White
The final season had several two-part episodes. It began with the resolution of
a cliffhanger involving a previously unknown colony of Kryptonians. Lois and
Clark finally wed in the third episode of the season entitled "Swear To God,
This Time We're Not Kidding". The same week, DC_Comics released Superman:_The
Wedding_Album, featuring the long-awaited marriage of Lois and Clark. The
series ended on a cliffhanger in which Lois and Clark find an infant in Clark's
old bassinet, along with a note that claimed the child belonged to them. This
mystery was never resolved in the television series; however Brad Buckner,
executive producer, and writer for the third and fourth seasons, later said
that the infant was Kryptonian royalty hidden with Lois and Clark so they could
protect him from assassins.[11]
During the fourth season, ABC had announced a fifth season of the show; its
producers and writers were unprepared when ABC later decided that no new
episodes would be produced. The series had weakened in its Sunday 8:00 pm
timeslot and had been shifted to 7:00 pm in January, and was moved to Saturdays
in the spring.[12] The ratings dropped even further, and the show finished its
last season in 104th place. It was removed from the schedule in May 1997.[12]
ABC made up for its commitment to Warner_Bros. by ordering thirteen episodes of
a Debra_Messing drama, Prey.
The fourth season starts with Clark heading toward New Krypton, while the evil
tyrant Nor has instead invaded Earth, so Clark returns just as Nor takes over
Smallville. He and Lois defeat the tyrant and persuade the New Kryptonians to
allow Clark to stay on Earth. After another failed wedding ceremony, Lois and
Clark get married. Evil forces continue to assault them, delaying their
honeymoon, but eventually, the couple moves into a new home. Throughout the
season they strengthen their bond, despite some disagreements and villains
trying to destroy them. The newlywed reporters discover that Clark cannot
father a child with Lois, but at the end of the last episode, a child
mysteriously appears. In an interview, series writer and executive producer
Brad Buckner said the planned story was that the child "was Kryptonian royalty,
stashed by his mother to keep him safe from assassins."[13]
