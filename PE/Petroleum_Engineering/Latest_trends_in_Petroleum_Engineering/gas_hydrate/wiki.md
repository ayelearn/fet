****** Clathrate hydrate ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Clathrate hydrates, or gas clathrates, gas hydrates, clathrates, hydrates,
etc., are crystalline water-based solids physically resembling ice, in which
small non-polar molecules (typically gases) or polar molecules with large
hydrophobic moieties are trapped inside "cages" of hydrogen_bonded, frozen
water_molecules. In other words, clathrate hydrates are clathrate_compounds in
which the host molecule is water and the guest molecule is typically a gas or
liquid. Without the support of the trapped molecules, the lattice structure of
hydrate clathrates would collapse into conventional ice crystal structure or
liquid water. Most low molecular weight gases, including O2, H2, N2, CO2, CH4,
H2S, Ar, Kr, and Xe, as well as some higher hydrocarbons and freons, will form
hydrates at suitable temperatures and pressures. Clathrate hydrates are not
officially chemical compounds, as the sequestered molecules are never bonded to
the lattice. The formation and decomposition of clathrate hydrates are first
order_phase_transitions, not chemical reactions. Their detailed formation and
decomposition mechanisms on a molecular level are still not well understood.[1]
[2] Clathrate hydrates were first documented in 1810 by Sir Humphry_Davy who
found that water was a primary component of what was earlier thought to be
solidified chlorine.[3][4]
Clathrates have been found to occur naturally in large quantities. Around 6.4
trillion (6.4Ã1012) tonnes of methane is trapped in deposits of methane
clathrate on the deep ocean_floor.[5] Such deposits can be found on the
Norwegian_continental_shelf in the northern headwall flank of the Storegga
Slide. Clathrates can also exist as permafrost, as at the Mallik_gas_hydrate
site in the Mackenzie_Delta of northwestern Canadian_Arctic. These natural gas
hydrates are seen as a potentially vast energy resource, but an economical
extraction method has so far proven elusive. Hydrocarbon clathrates cause
problems for the petroleum industry, because they can form inside gas
pipelines, often resulting in obstructions. Deep sea deposition of carbon
dioxide_clathrate has been proposed as a method to remove this greenhouse_gas
from the atmosphere and control climate_change.
Clathrates are suspected to occur in large quantities on some outer planets,
moons and trans-Neptunian_objects, binding gas at fairly high temperatures.[6]

***** Structure[edit] *****
Cages building the different gas hydrate structures.
Gas hydrates usually form two crystallographic cubic structures: structure
(Type) I (named sI) and structure (Type) II (named sII)[7] of space groups
P m   3 &#x00AF;   n   {\displaystyle Pm{\overline {3}}n}  [Pm{\overline {3}}n]
and     F d   3 &#x00AF;   m   {\displaystyle Fd{\overline {3}}m}  [Fd
{\overline {3}}m] respectively. Seldom, a third hexagonal structure of space
group     P 6  /  m m m   {\displaystyle P6/mmm}  [P6/mmm] may be observed
(Type H).[8]
The unit cell of Type I consists of 46 water molecules, forming two types of
cages â small and large. The unit cell contains two small cages and six large
ones. The small cage has the shape of a pentagonal dodecahedron (512) (which is
not a regular dodecahedron) and the large one that of a tetradecahedron,
specifically a hexagonal_truncated_trapezohedron (51262). Together, they form a
version of the WeaireâPhelan_structure. Typical guests forming Type I
hydrates are CO2 in carbon_dioxide_clathrate and CH4 in methane_clathrate.
The unit cell of Type II consists of 136 water molecules, again forming two
types of cages â small and large. In this case there are sixteen small cages
and eight large ones in the unit cell. The small cage again has the shape of a
pentagonal dodecahedron (512), but the large one is a hexadecahedron (51264).
Type II hydrates are formed by gases like O2 and N2.
The unit cell of Type H consists of 34 water molecules, forming three types of
cages â two small ones of different types, and one "huge". In this case, the
unit cell consists of three small cages of type 512, two small ones of type
435663 and one huge of type 51268. The formation of Type H requires the
cooperation of two guest gases (large and small) to be stable. It is the large
cavity that allows structure H hydrates to fit in large molecules (e.g. butane,
hydrocarbons), given the presence of other smaller help gases to fill and
support the remaining cavities. Structure H hydrates were suggested to exist in
the Gulf of Mexico. Thermogenically-produced supplies of heavy hydrocarbons are
common there.
***** Hydrates in the universe[edit] *****
Iro et al.,[9] trying to interpret the nitrogen deficiency in comets, stated
most of the conditions for hydrate formation in the protoplanetary_nebulae,
surrounding the pre-main_and_main_sequence stars were fulfilled, despite the
rapid grain growth to meter scale. The key was to provide enough microscopic
ice particles exposed to a gaseous environment. Observations of the radiometric
continuum of circumstellar_discs around     &#x03C4;   {\displaystyle \tau }
[\tau ]-Tauri and Herbig_Ae/Be_stars suggest massive dust disks consisting of
millimeter-sized grains, which disappear after several million years (e.g.,[10]
[11]). A lot of work on detecting water ices in the Universe was done on the
Infrared_Space_Observatory (ISO). For instance, broad emission_bands of water
ice at 43 and 60 Î¼m were found in the disk of the isolated Herbig_Ae/Be_star
HD 100546 in Musca. The one at 43 Î¼m is much weaker than the one at 60 Î¼m,
which means the water ice, is located in the outer parts of the disk at
temperatures below 50 K.[12] There is also another broad ice feature between 87
and 90 Î¼m, which is very similar to the one in NGC_6302 [13] (the Bug or
Butterfly nebula in Scorpius). Crystalline ices were also detected in the
proto-planetary disks of Îµ-Eridani and the isolated Fe star HD 142527[14][15]
in Lupus. 90% of the ice in the latter was found crystalline at temperature
around 50 K. HST demonstrated that relatively old circumstellar_disks, as the
one around the 5-million-year-old B9.5Ve[16] Herbig_Ae/Be_star HD 141569A, are
dusty.[17] Li & Lunine[18] found water ice there. Knowing the ices usually
exist at the outer parts of the proto-planetary_nebulae, Hersant et al.[19]
proposed an interpretation of the volatile enrichment, observed in the four
giant_planets of the Solar_System, with respect to the Solar abundances. They
assumed the volatiles had been trapped in the form of hydrates and incorporated
in the planetesimals flying in the protoplanetsâ feeding zones.
Kieffer et al. (2006) hypothesized that the geyser activity in the south polar
region of Saturn's moon Enceladus originates from clathrate hydrates, where
carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen are released when exposed to the vacuum
of space through the "Tiger_Stripe" fractures found in that area.[20] However,
subsequent analysis of plume material makes it more likely that the geysers on
Enceladus derive from a salty subsurface ocean.[21]
Carbon_dioxide_clathrate is believed to play a major role in different
processes on Mars. Hydrogen_clathrate is likely to form in condensation nebulae
for gas giants.
***** Hydrates on Earth[edit] *****
**** Natural gas hydrates[edit] ****
Main article: Methane_clathrate
Naturally on Earth gas hydrates can be found on the seabed, in ocean sediments,
[22] in deep lake sediments (e.g. Lake_Baikal), as well as in the permafrost
regions. The amount of methane potentially trapped in natural methane_hydrate
deposits may be significant (1015 to 1017 cubic metres),[23] which makes them
of major interest as a potential energy resource. Catastrophic release of
methane from the decomposition of such deposits may lead to a global climate
change, because CH4 is more of an efficient greenhouse gas than CO2 (see
Atmospheric_methane). The fast decomposition of such deposits is considered a
geohazard, due to its potential to trigger landslides, earthquakes and
tsunamis. However, natural gas hydrates do not contain only methane but also
other hydrocarbon gases, as well as H2S and CO2. Air_hydrates are frequently
observed in polar ice samples.
Pingos are common structures in permafrost regions.[24] Similar structures are
found in deep water related to methane leakages. Significantly, gas hydrates
can even be formed in the absence of a liquid phase. Under that situation,
water is dissolved in gas or in liquid hydrocarbon phase.[25]
In 2017, both Japan and China announced that attempts at large-scale resource
extraction of methane hydrates from under the seafloor were successful.
However, commercial-scale production remains years away.[26]
**** Gas hydrates in pipelines[edit] ****
Thermodynamic conditions favouring hydrate formation are often found in
pipelines. This is highly undesirable, because the clathrate crystals might
agglomerate and plug the line[27] and cause flow_assurance failure and damage
valves and instrumentation. The results can range from flow reduction to
equipment damage.
*** Hydrate formation, prevention and mitigation philosophy[edit] ***
Hydrates have a strong tendency to agglomerate and to adhere to the pipe wall
and thereby plug the pipeline. Once formed, they can be decomposed by
increasing the temperature and/or decreasing the pressure. Even under these
conditions, the clathrate dissociation is a slow process.
Therefore, preventing hydrate formation appears to be the key to the problem. A
hydrate prevention philosophy could typically be based on three levels of
security, listed in order of priority:
   1. Avoid operational conditions that might cause formation of hydrates by
      depressing the hydrate formation temperature using glycol_dehydration;
   2. Temporarily change operating_conditions in order to avoid hydrate
      formation;
   3. Prevent formation of hydrates by addition of chemicals that (a) shift the
      hydrate equilibrium conditions towards lower temperatures and higher
      pressures or (b) increase hydrate formation time (inhibitors)
The actual philosophy would depend on operational circumstances such as
pressure, temperature, type of flow (gas, liquid, presences of water etc.)
*** Hydrate inhibitors[edit] ***
When operating within a set of parameters where hydrates could be formed, there
are still ways to avoid their formation. Altering the gas composition by adding
chemicals can lower the hydrate formation temperature and/or delay their
formation. Two options generally exist:
    * Thermodynamic inhibitors
    * Kinetic_inhibitors/anti-agglomerants[28][29]
The most common thermodynamic inhibitors are methanol, monoethylene_glycol
(MEG), and diethylene_glycol (DEG), commonly referred to as glycol. All may be
recovered and recirculated, but the economics of methanol recovery is not
favourable in most cases. MEG is preferred over DEG for applications where the
temperature is expected to be â10 Â°C or lower due to high viscosity at low
temperatures. Triethylene_glycol (TEG) has too low vapour pressure to be suited
as an inhibitor injected into a gas stream. More methanol is lost in the gas
phase when compared to MEG or DEG.
The use of kinetic_inhibitors and anti-agglomerants in actual field operations
is a new and evolving technology. It requires extensive tests and optimisation
to the actual system. While kinetic inhibitors work by slowing down the
kinetics of the nucleation, anti-agglomerants do not stop the nucleation, but
stop the agglomeration (sticking together) of gas hydrate crystals. These two
kinds of inhibitors are also known as low_dosage_hydrate_inhibitors, because
they require much smaller concentrations than the conventional thermodynamic
inhibitors. Kinetic inhibitors, which do not require water and hydrocarbon
mixture to be effective, are usually polymers or copolymers and anti-
agglomerants (requires water and hydrocarbon mixture) are polymers or
zwitterionic â usually ammonium and COOH â surfactants being both attracted
to hydrates and hydrocarbons.
***** Empty clathrate hydrates[edit] *****
Empty clathrate hydrates[30] are thermodynamically unstable (guest molecules
are of paramount importance to stabilize these structures) with respect to ice,
and as such their study using experimental techniques is greatly limited to
very specific formation conditions; however, their mechanical stability renders
theoretical and computer simulation methods the ideal choice to address their
thermodynamic properties. Starting from very cold samples (110â145 K),
Falenty et al.[31] degassed Ne-sII clathrates for several hours using vacuum
pumping to obtain a so-called ice XVI, while employing neutron diffraction to
observe that (i) the empty sII hydrate structure decomposes at T â¥ 145 K and,
furthermore, (ii) the empty hydrate shows a negative thermal expansion at T <
55 K, and it is mechanically more stable and has a larger lattice constant at
low temperatures than the Ne-filled analogue. The existence of such a porous
ice had been theoretically predicted before.[32] From a theoretical
perspective, empty hydrates can be probed using Molecular Dynamics or Monte
Carlo techniques. Conde et al. used empty hydrates and a fully atomic
description of the solid lattice to estimate the phase diagram of H2O at
negative pressures and T â¤ 300 K,[33] and obtain the differences in chemical
potentials between ice Ih and the empty hydrates, central to the van der
WaalsâPlatteeuw theory. Jacobson et al. performed[34] simulations using a
monoatomic (coarse-grained) model developed for H2O that is capable of
capturing the tetrahedral symmetry of hydrates. Their calculations revealed
that, under 1 atm pressure, sI and sII empty hydrates are metastable regarding
the ice phases up to their melting temperatures, T = 245 Â± 2 K and T = 252 Â±
2 K, respectively. Matsui et al. employed[35] molecular dynamics to perform a
thorough and systematic study of several ice polymorphs, namely space fullerene
ices, zeolitic ices, and aeroices, and interpreted their relative stability in
terms of geometrical considerations.
The thermodynamics of metastable empty sI clathrate hydrates have been probed
over broad temperature and pressure ranges, 100 â¤ T (K) â¤ 220 and 1 â¤ p
(bar) â¤ 5000, by Cruz et al.[36] using large-scale simulations and compared
with experimental data at 1 bar. The whole pâVâT surface obtained was
fitted by the universal form of the Parsafar and Mason equation of state with
an accuracy of 99.7â99.9%. Framework deformation caused by applied
temperature followed a parabolic law, and there is a critical temperature above
which the isobaric thermal expansion becomes negative, ranging from 194.7 K at
1 bar to 166.2 K at 5000 bar. Response to the applied (p, T) field was analyzed
in terms of angle and distance descriptors of a classical tetrahedral structure
and observed to occur essentially by means of angular alteration for (p, T) >
(2000 bar, 200 K). The length of the hydrogen bonds responsible for framework
integrity was insensitive to the thermodynamic conditions and its average value
is r(ÌO H) = 0.25 nm.
