Coalbed methane (CBM or coal-bed methane),[1] coalbed gas, coal seam gas (CSG
[1]), or coal-mine methane (CMM)[2] is a form of natural_gas extracted from
coal beds.[3] In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in
United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries.
The term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of the coal. It is
called 'sweet gas' because of its lack of hydrogen_sulfide. The presence of
this gas is well known from its_occurrence in underground coal mining, where it
presents a serious safety risk. Coalbed methane is distinct from a typical
sandstone or other conventional gas reservoir, as the methane is stored within
the coal by a process called adsorption. The methane is in a near-liquid state,
lining the inside of pores within the coal (called the matrix). The open
fractures in the coal (called the cleats) can also contain free gas or can be
saturated with water.[citation_needed]
Unlike much natural gas from conventional reservoirs, coalbed methane contains
very little heavier hydrocarbons such as propane or butane, and no natural-gas
condensate. It often contains up to a few percent carbon_dioxide.

***** History[edit] *****
Coalbed methane grew out of venting methane from coal seams. Some coal beds
have long been known to be "gassy," and as a safety measure, boreholes were
drilled into the seams from the surface, and the methane allowed to vent before
mining.
Coalbed methane as a natural-gas resource received a major push from the US
federal government in the late 1970s. Federal price controls were discouraging
natural gas drilling by keeping natural gas prices below market levels; at the
same time, the government wanted to encourage more gas production. The US
Department of Energy funded research into a number of unconventional gas
sources, including coalbed methane. Coalbed methane was exempted from federal
price controls, and was also given a federal tax credit.
In Australia, commercial extraction of coal seam gas began in 1996 in the Bowen
Basin of Queensland.[4]
***** Reservoir properties[edit] *****
Gas contained in coal bed methane is mainly methane and trace quantities of
ethane, nitrogen, carbon_dioxide and few other gases. Intrinsic properties of
coal as found in nature determine the amount of gas that can be recovered.
**** Porosity[edit] ****
Coalbed methane_reservoirs are considered as a dual-porosity reservoirs. Dual
porosity reservoirs are reservoirs in which porosity related to cleats (natural
fractures) are responsible for flow behavior and reservoir porosity of the
matrix is responsible for the storage of gas. The porosity of a coalbed methane
reservoir can vary from 10%-20 %; However, the cleat porosity of the reservoir
is estimated to be in the range of 0.1%-1 % [5]
**** Adsorption capacity[edit] ****
Adsorption capacity of coal is defined as the volume of gas adsorbed per unit
mass of coal usually expressed in SCF (standard cubic feet, the volume at
standard pressure and temperature conditions) gas/ton of coal. The capacity to
adsorb depends on the rank and quality of coal. The range is usually between
100 and 800 SCF/ton for most coal seams found in the US. Most of the gas in
coal beds is in the adsorbed form. When the reservoir is put into production,
water in the fracture spaces is pumped off first. This leads to a reduction of
pressure enhancing desorption of gas from the matrix.[citation_needed]
**** Fracture permeability[edit] ****
As discussed before, the fracture permeability acts as the major channel for
the gas to flow. The higher the permeability, the higher the gas production.
For most coal seams found in the US, the permeability lies in the range of
0.1â50 milliDarcys. The permeability of fractured reservoirs changes with the
stress applied to them. Coal displays a stress-sensitive permeability and this
process plays an important role during stimulation and production operations[6]
[citation_needed].[7] Fracture permeability in Coalbed methane reservoir tends
to increase with depletion of gas; in contrast to conventional reservoirs. This
unique behavior is because of shrinking of coal, when methane is released from
its matrix, which results in opening up of fractures and increased
permeability.[8] It is also believed that due to shrinkage of coal matrix at
lower reservoir pressures, there is a loss of horizontal stress in the
reservoir which induces in-situ failure of coal. Such a failure has been
attributed to sudden decrease in the fracture permeability of the reservoir[9]
[7]
**** Thickness of formation and initial reservoir pressure[edit] ****
The thickness of the formation may not be directly proportional to the volume
of gas produced in some areas.[citation_needed]
For example, it has been observed in the Cherokee_Basin in Southeast Kansas
that a well with a single zone of 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) of pay can produce
excellent gas rates, whereas an alternative formation with twice the thickness
can produce next to nothing. Some coal (and shale) formations may have high gas
concentrations regardless of the formation's thickness, probably due to other
factors of the area's geology.[citation_needed]
The pressure difference between the well block and the sand face should be as
high as possible as is the case with any producing reservoir in general.
[citation_needed]
**** Other properties[edit] ****
Other affecting parameters include coal density, initial gas-phase
concentration, critical gas saturation, irreducible water saturation, relative
permeability to water and gas at conditions of Sw = 1.0 and Sg = 1-
Swirreducible respectively.[citation_needed]

Diagram of a coalbed methane well (US DOE)
Typical production profile of a coalbed methane well (USGS)
Main article: Coal_bed_methane_extraction
To extract the gas, a steel-encased hole is drilled into the coal seam 100 to
1,500 metres (330 to 4,920 ft) below ground. As the pressure within the coal
seam declines due to natural production or the pumping of water from the
coalbed, both gas and produced water come to the surface through tubing. Then
the gas is sent to a compressor station and into natural gas pipelines. The
produced water is either reinjected into isolated formations, released into
streams, used for irrigation, or sent to evaporation ponds. The water typically
contains dissolved solids such as sodium_bicarbonate and chloride but varies
depending on the formation geology.[citation_needed]
Coalbed methane wells often produce at lower gas rates than conventional
reservoirs, typically peaking at near 300,000 cubic feet (8,500 m3) per day
(about 0.100 mÂ³/s), and can have large initial costs. The production profiles
of CBM wells are typically characterized by a "negative_decline" in which the
gas production rate initially increases as the water is pumped off and gas
begins to desorb and flow. A dry CBM well is similar to a standard gas well.
[citation_needed]
The methane desorption process follows a curve (of gas content vs. reservoir
pressure) called a Langmuir_isotherm. The isotherm can be analytically
described by a maximum gas content (at infinite pressure), and the pressure at
which half that gas exists within the coal. These parameters (called the
Langmuir volume and Langmuir pressure, respectively) are properties of the
coal, and vary widely. A coal in Alabama and a coal in Colorado may have
radically different Langmuir parameters, despite otherwise similar coal
properties.[citation_needed]
As production occurs from a coal reservoir, the changes in pressure are
believed to cause changes in the porosity and permeability of the coal. This is
commonly known as matrix shrinkage/swelling. As the gas is desorbed, the
pressure exerted by the gas inside the pores decreases, causing them to shrink
in size and restricting gas flow through the coal. As the pores shrink, the
overall matrix shrinks as well, which may eventually increase the space the gas
can travel through (the cleats), increasing gas flow.[citation_needed]
The potential of a particular coalbed as a CBM source depends on the following
criteria. Cleat density/intensity: cleats are joints confined within coal
sheets. They impart permeability to the coal seam. A high cleat density is
required for profitable exploitation of CBM. Also important is the maceral
composition: maceral is a microscopic, homogeneous, petrographic entity of a
corresponding sedimentary rock. A high vitrinite composition is ideal for CBM
extraction, while inertinite hampers the same.[citation_needed]
The rank of coal has also been linked to CBM content: a vitrinite reflectance
of 0.8â1.5% has been found to imply higher productivity of the coalbed.
[citation_needed]
The gas composition must be considered, because natural gas appliances are
designed for gas with a heating value of about 1,000 BTU (British_thermal
units) per cubic foot, or nearly pure methane. If the gas contains more than a
few percent non-flammable gases such as nitrogen or carbon_dioxide, either
these will have to be removed or it will have to be blended with higher-BTU gas
to achieve pipeline quality. If the methane composition of the coalbed gas is
less than 92%, it may not be commercially marketable.[citation_needed]
***** Environmental impacts[edit] *****
**** Methane[edit] ****
As with all carbon based fossil fuels, burning coalbed methane releases carbon
dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Its effect as greenhouse gas was firstly
analyzed by chemist and physicist Svante_Arrhenius. CBM production also entails
leaks of fugitive methane into the atmosphere. Methane is rated as having 72
times the effect on global warming per unit of mass than CO2. over 20 years,
reducing to 25 times over 100 years and 7.5 times over 500 years.[10] Analysis
of life-cycle_greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_energy_sources indicates that
generating electricity from CBM, as with conventional natural gas, has less
than half the greenhouse gas effect of coal.[11]
In the United States, methane escaping from coal during mining amounts to 10
percent of total methane_emissions. Recovery of coal mine methane in advance of
mining is seen as a major opportunity to reduce methane emissions.[citation
needed]
**** Infrastructure[edit] ****
CBM wells are connected by a network of roads, pipelines, and compressor
stations. Over time, wells may be spaced more closely in order to extract the
remaining methane.
**** Produced water[edit] ****
The produced_water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction
varies greatly in quality from area to area, but may contain undesirable
concentrations of dissolved substances such as salts, naturally present
chemicals, heavy_metals and radionuclides.[12] In many producing regions the
water is treated, such as through a Reverse_Osmosis_plant and used beneficially
for irrigation, water for livestock, urban and industrial uses, or dust
suppression.
*** Pilliga Scrub[edit] ***
In 2012 Eastern Star Gas was fined for "discharging polluting water containing
high levels of salt into Bohena Creek" in the Pilliga Scrub.[13] There were "16
spills or leaks of contaminated water" including "serious spills of saline
water into woodland and a creek."[14] In 2012, a NSW Legislative Council[15]
inquiry criticised the use of open holding ponds, recommending that "the NSW
Government ban the open storage of produced water."[15][16]
*** Powder River Basin[edit] ***
Not all coalbed methane produced water is saline or otherwise undesirable.
Water from coalbed methane wells in the Powder_River_Basin of Wyoming, US,
commonly meets federal drinking water standards, and is widely used in the area
to water livestock.[17] Its use for irrigation is limited by its relatively
high sodium_adsorption_ratio.
**** Groundwater[edit] ****
Depending on aquifer connectivity, water withdrawal may depress aquifers over a
large area and affect groundwater flows.[18] In Australia, the CBM industry
estimates extraction of 126,000 million litres (3.3Ã1010 US gallons) to
280,000 million litres (7.4Ã1010 US gallons) of groundwater per year; while
the National_Water_Commission estimates extraction above 300,000 million litres
(7.9Ã1010 US gallons) a year.[12]
***** Coalbed methane producing areas[edit] *****
**** Australia[edit] ****

Coal Seam Gas resources are in the major coal basins in Queensland and New
South Wales, with further potential resources in South Australia. Commercial
recovery of coal seam gas (CSG) began in Australia in 1996. As of 2014, coal
seam gas, from Queensland and New South Wales, made up about ten percent of
Australia's gas production. Demonstrated reserves were estimated to be 33
trillion cubic feet (35 905 petajoules) as of January 2014.[19]
    * Bowen_Basin
    * Surat_Basin
    * Sydney_Basin
**** Canada[edit] ****
In Canada, British_Columbia is estimated to have approximately 90 trillion
cubic feet (2.5 trillion cubic metres) of coalbed gas. Alberta, in 2013, was
the only province with commercial coalbed methane wells and is estimated to
have approximately 170 trillion cubic feet (4.8 trillion cubic metres) of
economically recoverable coalbed methane, with overall reserves totaling up to
500 trillion cubic feet (14 trillion cubic metres).[20][21]
Coalbed methane is considered a non-renewable_resource, although the Alberta
Research_Council, Alberta_Geological_Survey and others have argued coalbed
methane is a renewable_resource because the bacterial action that formed the
methane is ongoing.[citation_needed] This is subject to debate since it has
also been shown that the dewatering that accompanies CBM production destroys
the conditions needed for the bacteria to produce methane[22] and the rate of
formation of additional methane is undetermined. This debate is currently
causing a right_of_ownership issue in the Canadian_province of Alberta, as only
non-renewable resources can legally be owned by the province.[23]
    * Western_Canadian_Sedimentary_Basin
**** United Kingdom[edit] ****
Although gas in place in Britain's coal fields has been estimated to be 2,900
billion cubic meters, it may be that as little as one percent might be
economically recoverable. Britain's CBM potential is largely untested. Some
methane is extracted by coal mine venting operations, and burned to generate
electricity. Assessment by private industry of coalbed methane wells
independent of mining began in 2008, when 55 onshore exploration licences were
issued, covering 7,000 square kilometers of potential coalbed methane areas.
IGas_Energy became the first in the UK to commercially extract coalbed methane
separate from mine venting; as of 2012, the Igas coalbed methane wells at Doe
Green, extracting gas for electrical generation, were the only commercial CBM
wells in the UK.[24]
**** United States[edit] ****
Main article: Coalbed_methane_in_the_United_States
United States coalbed methane production in 2011 was 1.76 trillion cubic feet
(TCF), 7.3 percent of all US dry gas production that year. The 2011 production
was down from the peak of 1.97 TCF in 2008.[25] Most CBM production came from
the Rocky Mountain states of Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico.
**** Kazakhstan[edit] ****
Kazakhstan could witness the development of a large coalbed methane (CBM)
sector over the coming decades, according to industry professionals.[26]
Preliminary research suggests there may be as much as 900 billion m3 of gas in
Kazakhstanâs main coalfields â 85% of all reserves in Kazakhstan.
**** India[edit] ****
With the completion of the drilling of 23 vertical production wells by Great
Eastern_Energy (GEECL), coalbed methane would be available in India for
commercial sale purpose from 14 July 2007 priced at â¹ 30 per kg for CNG.
Initially 90% of the CBM would be distributed among vehicles as CNG gas. GEECL
is also setting up the first CBM station in Southeast Asia and the same will be
located in India in the city of Asansol in West Bengal. GEECL is the first
company whose first field development plan has been approved.
Prashant Modi, President and Chief Operating Officer of GEECL, said, "We are
proud to be Indiaâs first private sector company that has ventured into Coal
Bed Methane exploration, production, marketing and distribution. With the
nation requiring higher energy sources to sustain its development pace, we are
confident that CBM will play an important role as one of the prime energy
source for the future generations."[27]
Essar_Group's Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Ltd.'s CBM portfolio
includes 5 blocks. Currently, only one of them, Raniganj East, is currently
operational. The others include Rajmahal in Jharkhand, Talcher and Ib Valley in
Odisha and Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. The 5 blocks possess estimated 10
Trillion Cubic Feet (CBF) of CBM reserves.
