***** Exploration methods[edit] *****
Visible surface features such as oil_seeps, natural gas seeps, pockmarks
(underwater craters caused by escaping gas) provide basic evidence of
hydrocarbon generation (be it shallow or deep in the Earth). However, most
exploration depends on highly sophisticated technology to detect and determine
the extent of these deposits using exploration_geophysics. Areas thought to
contain hydrocarbons are initially subjected to a gravity_survey, magnetic
survey, passive_seismic or regional seismic_reflection_surveys to detect large-
scale features of the sub-surface geology. Features of interest (known as
leads) are subjected to more detailed seismic surveys which work on the
principle of the time it takes for reflected sound waves to travel through
matter (rock) of varying densities and using the process of depth_conversion to
create a profile of the substructure. Finally, when a prospect has been
identified and evaluated and passes the oil company's selection criteria, an
exploration_well is drilled in an attempt to conclusively determine the
presence or absence of oil or gas.Offshore the risk can be reduced by using
electromagnetic methods [1]
Oil exploration is an expensive, high-risk operation. Offshore and remote area
exploration is generally only undertaken by very large corporations or national
governments. Typical shallow shelf oil wells (e.g. North_Sea) cost US$10 â 30
million, while deep water wells can cost up to US$100 million plus. Hundreds of
smaller companies search for onshore hydrocarbon deposits worldwide, with some
wells costing as little as US$100,000.
***** Elements of a petroleum prospect[edit] *****
Mud_log in process, a common way to study the rock types when drilling oil
wells.
A prospect is a potential trap which geologists believe may contain
hydrocarbons. A significant amount of geological, structural and seismic
investigation must first be completed to redefine the potential hydrocarbon
drill location from a lead to a prospect. Four geological factors have to be
present for a prospect to work and if any of them fail neither oil nor gas will
be present.
  Source_rock 
      When organic-rich rock such as oil_shale or coal is subjected to high
      pressure_and_temperature over an extended period of time, hydrocarbons
      form.
  Migration 
      The hydrocarbons are expelled from source rock by three density-related
      mechanisms: the newly matured hydrocarbons are less dense than their
      precursors, which causes over-pressure; the hydrocarbons are lighter, and
      so migrate upwards due to buoyancy, and the fluids expand as further
      burial causes increased heating. Most hydrocarbons migrate to the surface
      as oil seeps, but some will get trapped.
  Reservoir 
      The hydrocarbons are contained in a reservoir rock. This is commonly a
      porous sandstone or limestone. The oil collects in the pores within the
      rock although open fractures within non-porous rocks (e.g. fractured
      granite) may also store hydrocarbons. The reservoir must also be
      permeable so that the hydrocarbons will flow to surface during
      production.
  Trap 
      The hydrocarbons are buoyant and have to be trapped within a structural
      (e.g. Anticline, fault_block) or stratigraphic_trap. The hydrocarbon trap
      has to be covered by an impermeable rock known as a seal or cap-rock in
      order to prevent hydrocarbons escaping to the surface
***** Exploration risk[edit] *****
Hydrocarbon exploration is a high risk investment and risk assessment is
paramount for successful project_portfolio_management. Exploration risk is a
difficult concept and is usually defined by assigning confidence to the
presence of the imperative geological factors, as discussed above. This
confidence is based on data and/or models and is usually mapped on Common Risk
Segment Maps (CRS Maps). High confidence in the presence of imperative
geological factors is usually coloured green and low confidence coloured red.
[2] Therefore, these maps are also called Traffic Light Maps, while the full
procedure is often referred to as Play Fairway Analysis.[3] The aim of such
procedures is to force the geologist to objectively assess all different
geological factors. Furthermore, it results in simple maps that can be
understood by non-geologists and managers to base exploration decisions on.
***** Terms used in petroleum evaluation[edit] *****
  Bright_spot 
      On a seismic section, coda that have high amplitudes due to a formation
      containing hydrocarbons.
  Chance of success
      An estimate of the chance of all the elements (see above) within a
      prospect working, described as a probability.
  Dry hole 
      A boring that does not contain commercial hydrocarbons. See also Dry_hole
      clause
  Flat spot 
      Possibly an oil-water, gas-water or gas-oil contact on a seismic section;
      flat due to gravity.
  Full Waveform Inversion 
      A supercomputer technique recently use in conjunction with seismic
      sensors to explore for petroleum deposits offshore.[4]
  Hydrocarbon in place 
      Amount of hydrocarbon likely to be contained in the prospect. This is
      calculated using the volumetric_equation - GRV x N/G x Porosity x Sh /
      FVF
        Gross rock volume (GRV) 
            Amount of rock in the trap above the hydrocarbon water contact
        Net sand 
            Part of GRV that has the lithological capacity for being a
            productive zone; i.e. less shale contaminations.[5]
        Net reserve 
            Part of net sand that has the minimum reservoir qualities; i.e.
            minimum porosity and permeability values.[5]
        Net/gross ratio (N/G) 
            Proportion of the GRV formed by the reservoir rock (range is 0 to
            1)
        Porosity 
            Percentage of the net reservoir rock occupied by pores (typically
            5-35%)
        Hydrocarbon saturation (Sh) 
            Some of the pore space is filled with water - this must be
            discounted
        Formation volume factor (FVF) 
            Oil shrinks and gas expands when brought to the surface. The FVF
            converts volumes at reservoir conditions (high pressure and high
            temperature) to storage and sale conditions
  Lead 
      Potential accumulation is currently poorly defined and requires more data
      acquisition and/or evaluation in order to be classified as a prospect.[6]
  Play 
      An area in which hydrocarbon accumulations or prospects of a given type
      occur. For example, the shale gas plays in North America include the
      Barnett, Eagle_Ford, Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus, and Woodford,
      among many others.[7]
  Prospect 
      A lead which has been more fully evaluated.
  Recoverable hydrocarbons 
      Amount of hydrocarbon likely to be recovered during production. This is
      typically 10-50% in an oil field and 50-80% in a gas field.
***** Licensing[edit] *****
Petroleum resources are typically owned by the government of the host country.
In the United States, most onshore (land) oil and gas rights (OGM) are owned by
private individuals, in which case oil companies must negotiate terms for a
lease of these rights with the individual who owns the OGM. Sometimes this is
not the same person who owns the land surface. In most nations the government
issues licences to explore, develop and produce its oil and gas resources,
which are typically administered by the oil ministry. There are several
different types of licence. Oil companies often operate in joint ventures to
spread the risk; one of the companies in the partnership is designated the
operator who actually supervises the work.
  Tax and Royalty 
      Companies would pay a royalty on any oil produced, together with a
      profits tax (which can have expenditure offset against it). In some cases
      there are also various bonuses and ground rents (license fees) payable to
      the government - for example a signature bonus payable at the start of
      the licence. Licences are awarded in competitive bid rounds on the basis
      of either the size of the work programme (number of wells, seismic etc.)
      or size of the signature bonus.
  Production Sharing contract (PSA) 
      A PSA is more complex than a Tax/Royalty system - The companies bid on
      the percentage of the production that the host government receives (this
      may be variable with the oil price), There is often also participation by
      the Government owned National Oil Company (NOC). There are also various
      bonuses to be paid. Development expenditure is offset against production
      revenue.
  Service contract 
      This is when an oil company acts as a contractor for the host government,
      being paid to produce the hydrocarbons.
***** Reserves and resources[edit] *****
Resources are hydrocarbons which may or may not be produced in the future. A
resource number may be assigned to an undrilled prospect or an unappraised
discovery. Appraisal by drilling additional delineation wells or acquiring
extra seismic data will confirm the size of the field and lead to project
sanction. At this point the relevant government body gives the oil company a
production licence which enables the field to be developed. This is also the
point at which oil_reserves and gas_reserves can be formally booked.
**** Oil and gas reserves[edit] ****
Oil and gas reserves are defined as volumes that will be commercially recovered
in the future. Reserves are separated into three categories: proved, probable,
and possible. To be included in any reserves category, all commercial aspects
must have been addressed, which includes government consent. Technical issues
alone separate proved from unproved categories. All reserve estimates involve
some degree of uncertainty.
    * Proved reserves are the highest valued category. Proved_reserves have a
      "reasonable certainty" of being recovered, which means a high degree of
      confidence that the volumes will be recovered. Some industry specialists
      refer to this as P90, i.e., having a 90% certainty of being produced. The
      SEC provides a more detailed definition:
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by
analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable
certainty to be economically producibleâfrom a given date forward, from known
reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and
government regulationsâprior to the time at which contracts providing the
right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably
certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used
for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced
or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project
within a reasonable time.[8]
    * Probable reserves are volumes defined as "less likely to be recovered
      than proved, but more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves".
      Some industry specialists refer to this as P50, i.e., having a 50%
      certainty of being produced.
    * Possible reserves are reserves which analysis of geological and
      engineering data suggests are less likely to be recoverable than probable
      reserves. Some industry specialists refer to this as P10, i.e., having a
      10% certainty of being produced.
The term 1P is frequently used to denote proved reserves; 2P is the sum of
proved and probable reserves; and 3P the sum of proved, probable, and possible
reserves. The best estimate of recovery from committed projects is generally
considered to be the 2P sum of proved and probable reserves. Note that these
volumes only refer to currently justified projects or those projects already in
development.[9]
**** Reserve booking[edit] ****
Oil and gas reserves are the main asset of an oil company. Booking is the
process by which they are added to the balance sheet.
In the United States, booking is done according to a set of rules developed by
the Society_of_Petroleum_Engineers (SPE). The reserves of any company listed on
the New_York_Stock_Exchange have to be stated to the U.S._Securities_and
Exchange_Commission. Reported reserves may be audited by outside geologists,
although this is not a legal requirement.
In Russia, companies report their reserves to the State Commission on Mineral
Reserves (GKZ).[citation_needed]
