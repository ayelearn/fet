Alpha_decay is one type of radioactive decay, in which an atomic nucleus emits
an alpha_particle, and thereby transforms (or "decays") into an atom with a
mass_number decreased by 4 and atomic_number decreased by 2.
Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, radioactivity or nuclear
radiation) is the process by which an unstable atomic_nucleus loses energy (in
terms of mass in its rest_frame) by emitting radiation, such as an alpha
particle, beta_particle with neutrino or only a neutrino in the case of
electron_capture, or a gamma_ray or electron in the case of internal
conversion. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive.
Certain highly excited short-lived nuclear states can decay through neutron
emission, or more rarely, proton_emission.
Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single
atoms. According to quantum_theory, it is impossible to predict when a
particular atom will decay,[1][2][3] regardless of how long the atom has
existed. However, for a collection of atoms, the expected decay rate is
characterized in terms of measured decay_constants or half-lives. This is the
basis of radiometric_dating. The half-lives of radioactive atoms have no known
upper limit, spanning a time range of over 55 orders_of_magnitude, from nearly
instantaneous to far longer than the age_of_the_universe.
A radioactive nucleus with zero spin can have no defined orientation, and hence
emits the total momentum of its decay products isotropically (all directions
and without bias). If there are multiple particles produced during a single
decay, as in beta_decay, their relative angular distribution, or spin
directions may not be isotropic. Decay products from a nucleus with spin may be
distributed non-isotropically with respect to that spin direction. Either
because of an external influence such as an electromagnetic_field, or because
the nucleus was produced in a dynamic process that constrained the direction of
its spin, the anisotopy may be detectable. Such a parent process could be a
previous decay, or a nuclear_reaction.[4][5][6][note_1]
The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope
[note_2]), and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide. Except for
gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited_state, the decay is a
nuclear_transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of
protons or neutrons (or both). When the number of protons changes, an atom of a
different chemical_element is created.
The first decay processes to be discovered were alpha decay, beta decay, and
gamma decay. Alpha_decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle
(helium nucleus). This is the most common process of emitting nucleons, but
highly excited nuclei can eject single nucleons, or in the case of cluster
decay, specific light nuclei of other elements. Beta_decay occurs in two ways:
(i) beta-minus decay, when the nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino in
a process that changes a neutron to a proton, or (ii) beta-plus decay, when the
nucleus emits a positron and a neutrino in a process that changes a proton to a
neutron. Highly excited neutron-rich nuclei, formed as the product of other
types of decay, occasionally lose energy by way of neutron emission, resulting
in a change from one isotope to another of the same element. The nucleus may
capture an orbiting electron, causing a proton to convert into a neutron in a
process called electron capture. All of these processes result in a well-
defined nuclear transmutation.
By contrast, there are radioactive decay processes that do not result in a
nuclear transmutation. The energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a
gamma ray in a process called gamma_decay, or that energy may be lost when the
nucleus interacts with an orbital electron causing its ejection from the atom,
in a process called internal_conversion.
Another type of radioactive decay results in products that vary, appearing as
two or more "fragments" of the original nucleus with a range of possible
masses. This decay, called spontaneous fission, happens when a large unstable
nucleus spontaneously splits into two (or occasionally three) smaller daughter
nuclei, and generally leads to the emission of gamma rays, neutrons, or other
particles from those products.
For a summary table showing the number of stable and radioactive nuclides in
each category, see radionuclide. There are 28 naturally occurring chemical
elements on Earth that are radioactive, consisting of 34 radionuclides (6
elements have 2 different radionuclides) that date before the time of formation
of the solar system. These 34 are known as primordial_nuclides. Well-known
examples are uranium and thorium, but also included are naturally occurring
long-lived radioisotopes, such as potassium-40. Another 50 or so shorter-lived
radionuclides, such as radium and radon, found on Earth, are the products of
decay_chains that began with the primordial nuclides, or are the product of
ongoing cosmogenic processes, such as the production of carbon-14 from
nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic_rays. Radionuclides may also be
produced_artificially in particle_accelerators or nuclear_reactors, resulting
in 650 of these with half-lives of over an hour, and several thousand more with
even shorter half-lives. (See List_of_nuclides for a list of these sorted by
half-life.)

***** History of discovery[edit] *****
Pierre and Marie Curie in their Paris laboratory, before 1907
Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri_Becquerel,
while working with phosphorescent materials.[7] These materials glow in the
dark after exposure to light, and he suspected that the glow produced in
cathode_ray_tubes by X-rays might be associated with phosphorescence. He
wrapped a photographic plate in black paper and placed various phosphorescent
salts on it. All results were negative until he used uranium salts. The uranium
salts caused a blackening of the plate in spite of the plate being wrapped in
black paper. These radiations were given the name "Becquerel Rays".
It soon became clear that the blackening of the plate had nothing to do with
phosphorescence, as the blackening was also produced by non-phosphorescent
salts of uranium and by metallic uranium. It became clear from these
experiments that there was a form of invisible radiation that could pass
through paper and was causing the plate to react as if exposed to light.
At first, it seemed as though the new radiation was similar to the then
recently discovered X-rays. Further research by Becquerel, Ernest_Rutherford,
Paul_Villard, Pierre_Curie, Marie_Curie, and others showed that this form of
radioactivity was significantly more complicated. Rutherford was the first to
realize that all such elements decay in accordance with the same mathematical
exponential formula. Rutherford and his student Frederick_Soddy were the first
to realize that many decay processes resulted in the transmutation of one
element to another. Subsequently, the radioactive_displacement_law_of_Fajans
and_Soddy was formulated to describe the products of alpha and beta_decay.[8]
[9]
The early researchers also discovered that many other chemical_elements,
besides uranium, have radioactive_isotopes. A systematic search for the total
radioactivity in uranium ores also guided Pierre and Marie Curie to isolate two
new elements: polonium and radium. Except for the radioactivity of radium, the
chemical similarity of radium to barium made these two elements difficult to
distinguish.
Marie and Pierre Curie's study of radioactivity is an important factor in
science and medicine. After their research on Becquerel's rays led them to the
discovery of both radium and polonium, they coined the term "radioactivity".
[10] Their research on the penetrating rays in uranium and the discovery of
radium launched an era of using radium for the treatment of cancer. Their
exploration of radium could be seen as the first peaceful use of nuclear energy
and the start of modern nuclear_medicine.[10]
***** Early health dangers[edit] *****
Main article: Ionizing_radiation
Taking an X-ray image with early Crookes_tube apparatus in 1896. The Crookes
tube is visible in the centre. The standing man is viewing his hand with a
fluoroscope screen; this was a common way of setting up the tube. No
precautions against radiation exposure are being taken; its hazards were not
known at the time.
The dangers of ionizing_radiation due to radioactivity and X-rays were not
immediately recognized.
**** X-rays[edit] ****
The discovery of xârays by Wilhelm_RÃ¶ntgen in 1895 led to widespread
experimentation by scientists, physicians, and inventors. Many people began
recounting stories of burns, hair loss and worse in technical journals as early
as 1896. In February of that year, Professor Daniel and Dr. Dudley of
Vanderbilt_University performed an experiment involving X-raying Dudley's head
that resulted in his hair loss. A report by Dr. H.D. Hawks, of his suffering
severe hand and chest burns in an X-ray demonstration, was the first of many
other reports in Electrical Review.[11]
Other experimenters, including Elihu_Thomson and Nikola_Tesla, also reported
burns. Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an X-ray tube over a period of
time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering.[12] Other effects, including
ultraviolet rays and ozone, were sometimes blamed for the damage,[13] and many
physicians still claimed that there were no effects from X-ray exposure at all.
[12]
Despite this, there were some early systematic hazard investigations, and as
early as 1902 William_Herbert_Rollins wrote almost despairingly that his
warnings about the dangers involved in the careless use of X-rays were not
being heeded, either by industry or by his colleagues. By this time, Rollins
had proved that X-rays could kill experimental animals, could cause a pregnant
guinea pig to abort, and that they could kill a fetus.[14] He also stressed
that "animals vary in susceptibility to the external action of X-light" and
warned that these differences be considered when patients were treated by means
of X-rays.
**** Radioactive substances[edit] ****
Radioactivity is characteristic of elements with large atomic number. Elements
with at least one stable isotope are shown in light blue. Green shows elements
of which the most stable isotope has a half-life measured in millions of years.
Yellow and orange are progressively less stable, with half-lives in thousands
or hundreds of years, down toward one day. Red and purple show highly and
extremely radioactive elements where the most stable isotopes exhibit half-
lives measured on the order of one day and much less.
However, the biological effects of radiation due to radioactive substances were
less easy to gauge. This gave the opportunity for many physicians and
corporations to market radioactive substances as patent_medicines. Examples
were radium enema treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as
tonics. Marie_Curie protested against this sort of treatment, warning that the
effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later
died from aplastic_anaemia, likely caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. By
the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death of radium
treatment enthusiasts, radium-containing medicinal products had been largely
removed from the market (radioactive_quackery).
**** Radiation protection[edit] ****
Main article: Radiation_protection
See also: Sievert and Ionizing_radiation
Only a year after RÃ¶ntgen's discovery of X rays, the American engineer Wolfram
Fuchs (1896) gave what is probably the first protection advice, but it was not
until 1925 that the first International Congress of Radiology (ICR) was held
and considered establishing international protection standards. The effects of
radiation on genes, including the effect of cancer risk, were recognized much
later. In 1927, Hermann_Joseph_Muller published research showing genetic
effects and, in 1946, was awarded the Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine for
his findings.
The second ICR was held in Stockholm in 1928 and proposed the adoption of the
rontgen unit, and the 'International X-ray and Radium Protection Committee'
(IXRPC) was formed. Rolf_Sievert was named Chairman, but a driving force was
George Kaye of the British National_Physical_Laboratory. The committee met in
1931, 1934 and 1937.
After World_War_II, the increased range and quantity of radioactive substances
being handled as a result of military and civil nuclear programmes led to large
groups of occupational workers and the public being potentially exposed to
harmful levels of ionising radiation. This was considered at the first post-war
ICR convened in London in 1950, when the present International_Commission_on
Radiological_Protection (ICRP) was born.[15] Since then the ICRP has developed
the present international system of radiation protection, covering all aspects
of radiation hazard.
***** Units of radioactivity[edit] *****
Graphic showing relationships between radioactivity and detected ionizing
radiation
The International_System_of_Units (SI) unit of radioactive activity is the
becquerel (Bq), named in honor of the scientist Henri_Becquerel. One Bq is
defined as one transformation (or decay or disintegration) per second.
An older unit of radioactivity is the curie, Ci, which was originally defined
as "the quantity or mass of radium_emanation in equilibrium with one gram of
radium (element)".[16] Today, the curie is defined as 3.7Ã1010 disintegrations
per second, so that 1 curie (Ci) = 3.7Ã1010 Bq. For radiological protection
purposes, although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the
use of the unit curie alongside SI units,[17] the European_Union European_units
of_measurement_directives required that its use for "public health ...
purposes" be phased out by 31 December 1985.[18]
The effects of ionizing radiation are often measured in units of gray for
mechanical or sievert for damage to tissue.
***** Types of decay[edit] *****
Alpha_particles may be completely stopped by a sheet of paper, beta_particles
by aluminium shielding. Gamma_rays can only be reduced by much more substantial
mass, such as a very thick layer of lead.
Main articles: Nuclear_drip_line, Gamma_decay, Internal_conversion, Electron
capture, Alpha_decay, Nuclear_fission, Neutron_emission, and Cluster_emission
Early researchers found that an electric or magnetic_field could split
radioactive emissions into three types of beams. The rays were given the names
alpha, beta, and gamma, in increasing order of their ability to penetrate
matter. Alpha decay is observed only in heavier elements of atomic number 52
(tellurium) and greater, with the exception of beryllium-8 which decays to two
alpha particles. The other two types of decay are produced by all of the
elements. Lead, atomic_number 82, is the heaviest element to have any isotopes
stable (to the limit of measurement) to radioactive decay. Radioactive decay is
seen in all isotopes of all elements of atomic number 83 (bismuth) or greater.
Bismuth-209, however, is only very slightly radioactive, with a half-life
greater than the age of the universe; radioisotopes with extremely long half-
lives are considered effectively stable for practical purposes.

atomic_number Z (shown are Î±, Î²Â±, p+, and n0 emissions, EC denotes electron
capture).
Types of radioactive decay related to N and Z numbers
In analysing the nature of the decay products, it was obvious from the
direction of the electromagnetic_forces applied to the radiations by external
magnetic and electric fields that alpha_particles carried a positive charge,
beta_particles carried a negative charge, and gamma_rays were neutral. From the
magnitude of deflection, it was clear that alpha_particles were much more
massive than beta_particles. Passing alpha particles through a very thin glass
window and trapping them in a discharge_tube allowed researchers to study the
emission_spectrum of the captured particles, and ultimately proved that alpha
particles are helium nuclei. Other experiments showed beta radiation, resulting
from decay and cathode_rays, were high-speed electrons. Likewise, gamma
radiation and X-rays were found to be high-energy electromagnetic_radiation.
The relationship between the types of decays also began to be examined: For
example, gamma decay was almost always found to be associated with other types
of decay, and occurred at about the same time, or afterwards. Gamma decay as a
separate phenomenon, with its own half-life (now termed isomeric_transition),
was found in natural radioactivity to be a result of the gamma decay of excited
metastable nuclear_isomers, which were in turn created from other types of
decay.
Although alpha, beta, and gamma radiations were most commonly found, other
types of emission were eventually discovered. Shortly after the discovery of
the positron in cosmic ray products, it was realized that the same process that
operates in classical beta_decay can also produce positrons (positron
emission), along with neutrinos (classical beta decay produces antineutrinos).
In a more common analogous process, called electron_capture, some proton-rich
nuclides were found to capture their own atomic electrons instead of emitting
positrons, and subsequently these nuclides emit only a neutrino and a gamma ray
from the excited nucleus (and often also Auger_electrons and characteristic_X-
rays, as a result of the re-ordering of electrons to fill the place of the
missing captured electron). These types of decay involve the nuclear capture of
electrons or emission of electrons or positrons, and thus acts to move a
nucleus toward the ratio of neutrons to protons that has the least energy for a
given total number of nucleons. This consequently produces a more stable (lower
energy) nucleus.
(A theoretical process of positron_capture, analogous to electron capture, is
possible in antimatter atoms, but has not been observed, as complex antimatter
atoms beyond antihelium are not experimentally available.[19] Such a decay
would require antimatter atoms at least as complex as beryllium-7, which is the
lightest known isotope of normal matter to undergo decay by electron capture.)
Shortly after the discovery of the neutron in 1932, Enrico_Fermi realized that
certain rare beta-decay reactions immediately yield neutrons as a decay
particle (neutron_emission). Isolated proton_emission was eventually observed
in some elements. It was also found that some heavy elements may undergo
spontaneous_fission into products that vary in composition. In a phenomenon
called cluster_decay, specific combinations of neutrons and protons other than
alpha particles (helium nuclei) were found to be spontaneously emitted from
atoms.
Other types of radioactive decay were found to emit previously-seen particles,
but via different mechanisms. An example is internal_conversion, which results
in an initial electron emission, and then often further characteristic_X-rays
and Auger_electrons emissions, although the internal conversion process
involves neither beta nor gamma decay. A neutrino is not emitted, and none of
the electron(s) and photon(s) emitted originate in the nucleus, even though the
energy to emit all of them does originate there. Internal conversion decay,
like isomeric_transition gamma decay and neutron emission, involves the release
of energy by an excited nuclide, without the transmutation of one element into
another.
Rare events that involve a combination of two beta-decay type events happening
simultaneously are known (see below). Any decay process that does not violate
the conservation of energy or momentum laws (and perhaps other particle
conservation laws) is permitted to happen, although not all have been detected.
An interesting example discussed in a final section, is bound_state_beta_decay
of rhenium-187. In this process, beta electron-decay of the parent nuclide is
not accompanied by beta electron emission, because the beta particle has been
captured into the K-shell of the emitting atom. An antineutrino is emitted, as
in all negative beta decays.
Radionuclides can undergo a number of different reactions. These are summarized
in the following table. A nucleus with mass_number A and atomic_number Z is
represented as (A, Z). The column "Daughter nucleus" indicates the difference
between the new nucleus and the original nucleus. Thus, (A â 1, Z) means that
the mass number is one less than before, but the atomic number is the same as
before.
If energy circumstances are favorable, a given radionuclide may undergo many
competing types of decay, with some atoms decaying by one route, and others
decaying by another. An example is copper-64, which has 29 protons, and 35
neutrons, which decays with a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has
one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the
neutron can decay to the other particle, which has opposite isospin. This
particular nuclide (though not all nuclides in this situation) is almost
equally likely to decay through positron_emission (18%), or through electron
capture (43%), as it does through electron emission (39%). The excited energy
states resulting from these decays which fail to end in a ground energy state,
also produce later internal_conversion and gamma_decay in almost 0.5% of the
time.
More common in heavy nuclides is competition between alpha and beta decay. The
daughter nuclides will then normally decay through beta or alpha, respectively,
to end up in the same place.
Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass, once the released
energy (the disintegration energy) has escaped in some way. Although decay
energy is sometimes defined as associated with the difference between the mass
of the parent nuclide products and the mass of the decay products, this is true
only of rest mass measurements, where some energy has been removed from the
product system. This is true because the decay energy must always carry mass
with it, wherever it appears (see mass_in_special_relativity) according to the
formula E = mc2. The decay energy is initially released as the energy of
emitted photons plus the kinetic energy of massive emitted particles (that is,
particles that have rest mass). If these particles come to thermal_equilibrium
with their surroundings and photons are absorbed, then the decay energy is
transformed to thermal energy, which retains its mass.
Decay energy therefore remains associated with a certain measure of mass of the
decay system, called invariant_mass, which does not change during the decay,
even though the energy of decay is distributed among decay particles. The
energy of photons, the kinetic energy of emitted particles, and, later, the
thermal energy of the surrounding matter, all contribute to the invariant_mass
of the system. Thus, while the sum of the rest masses of the particles is not
conserved in radioactive decay, the system mass and system invariant_mass (and
also the system total energy) is conserved throughout any decay process. This
is a restatement of the equivalent laws of conservation_of_energy and
conservation_of_mass.

***** Radioactive decay rates[edit] *****
The decay rate, or activity, of a radioactive substance is characterized by:
Constant quantities:
    * The half-lifeât1/2, is the time taken for the activity of a given
      amount of a radioactive substance to decay to half of its initial value;
      see List_of_nuclides.
    * The decay_constantâ Î», "lambda" the reciprocal of the mean lifetime,
      sometimes referred to as simply decay rate.
    * The mean_lifetimeâ Ï, "tau" the average lifetime (1/e life) of a
      radioactive particle before decay.
Although these are constants, they are associated with the statistical_behavior
of_populations of atoms. In consequence, predictions using these constants are
less accurate for minuscule samples of atoms.
In principle a half-life, a third-life, or even a (1/√2)-life, can be used in
exactly the same way as half-life; but the mean life and half-life t1/2 have
been adopted as standard times associated with exponential decay.
Time-variable quantities:
    * Total activityâ A, is the number of decays per unit time of a
      radioactive sample.
    * Number of particlesâN, is the total number_of_particles in the sample.
    * Specific activityâSA, number of decays per unit time per amount of
      substance of the sample at time set to zero (t = 0). "Amount of
      substance" can be the mass, volume or moles of the initial sample.
These are related as follows:
          t  1  /  2   =    ln &#x2061; ( 2 )  &#x03BB;   = &#x03C4; ln
      &#x2061; ( 2 )   {\displaystyle t_{1/2}={\frac {\ln(2)}{\lambda }}=\tau
      \ln(2)}  [t_{1/2}={\frac {\ln(2)}{\lambda }}=\tau \ln(2)]
         A = &#x2212;     d  N    d  t    = &#x03BB; N   {\displaystyle A=-
      {\frac {\mathrm {d} N}{\mathrm {d} t}}=\lambda N}  [A=-{\frac {\mathrm
      {d} N}{\mathrm {d} t}}=\lambda N]
          S  A    a  0   = &#x2212;     d  N    d  t       |    t = 0   =
      &#x03BB;  N  0     {\displaystyle S_{A}a_{0}=-{\frac {\mathrm {d} N}
      {\mathrm {d} t}}{\bigg |}_{t=0}=\lambda N_{0}}  [S_{A}a_{0}=-{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} N}{\mathrm {d} t}}{\bigg |}_{t=0}=\lambda N_{0}]
where N0 is the initial amount of active substance â substance that has the
same percentage of unstable particles as when the substance was formed.

**** Universal law of radioactive decay[edit] ****
Radioactivity is one very frequently given example of exponential_decay. The
law describes the statistical behaviour of a large number of nuclei, rather
than one individual nucleus. In the following formalism, the number of nuclei
or the nuclei population N, is of course a discrete variable (a natural
number)âbut for any physical sample N is so large that it can be treated as a
continuous variable. Differential_calculus is used to model the behaviour of
nuclear decay.
The mathematics of radioactive decay depend on a key assumption that a nucleus
of a radionuclide has no "memory" or way of translating its history into its
present behavior. A nucleus does not "age" with the passage of time. Thus, the
probability of its breaking down does not increase with time, but stays
constant no matter how long the nucleus has existed. This constant probability
may vary greatly between different types of nuclei, leading to the many
different observed decay rates. However, whatever the probability is, it does
not change. This is in marked contrast to complex objects which do show aging,
such as automobiles and humans. These systems do have a chance of breakdown per
unit of time, that increases from the moment they begin their existence.
*** One-decay process[edit] ***
Consider the case of a nuclide A that decays into another B by some process A
â B (emission of other particles, like electron_neutrinos
ν
e and electrons eâ as in beta_decay, are irrelevant in what follows). The
decay of an unstable nucleus is entirely random in time so it is impossible to
predict when a particular atom will decay. However, it is equally likely to
decay at any instant in time. Therefore, given a sample of a particular
radioisotope, the number of decay events âdN expected to occur in a small
interval of time dt is proportional to the number of atoms present N, that is
[20]
         &#x2212;     d  N    d  t    &#x221D; N .   {\displaystyle -{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} N}{\mathrm {d} t}}\propto N.}  [-{\frac {\mathrm {d} N}
      {\mathrm {d} t}}\propto N.]
Particular radionuclides decay at different rates, so each has its own decay
constant Î». The expected decay âdN/N is proportional to an increment of
time, dt:
   &#x2212;     d  N  N   = &#x03BB;  d  t   {\displaystyle -{\frac {\mathrm
{d} N}{N}}=\lambda \mathrm {d} t}  [-{\frac {\mathrm {d} N}{N}}=\lambda \mathrm
{d} t]
The negative sign indicates that N decreases as time increases, as the decay
events follow one after another. The solution to this first-order differential
equation is the function:
         N ( t ) =  N  0     e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  t     {\displaystyle N
      (t)=N_{0}\,e^{-{\lambda }t}}  [{\displaystyle N(t)=N_{0}\,e^{-{\lambda
      }t}}]
where N0 is the value of N at time t = 0, with the decay constant expressed as
Î»[20]
We have for all time t:
          N  A   +  N  B   =  N   t o t a l    =  N  A 0   ,   {\displaystyle
      N_{A}+N_{B}=N_{\mathrm {total} }=N_{A0},}  [N_{A}+N_{B}=N_{\mathrm
      {total} }=N_{A0},]
where Ntotal is the constant number of particles throughout the decay process,
which is equal to the initial number of A nuclides since this is the initial
substance.
If the number of non-decayed A nuclei is:
          N  A   =  N  A 0    e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  t     {\displaystyle N_
      {A}=N_{A0}e^{-{\lambda }t}}  [{\displaystyle N_{A}=N_{A0}e^{-{\lambda
      }t}}]
then the number of nuclei of B, i.e. the number of decayed A nuclei, is
          N  B   =  N  A 0   &#x2212;  N  A   =  N  A 0   &#x2212;  N  A 0    e
      &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  t   =  N  A 0    (  1 &#x2212;  e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;
      t    )  .   {\displaystyle N_{B}=N_{A0}-N_{A}=N_{A0}-N_{A0}e^{-{\lambda
      }t}=N_{A0}\left(1-e^{-{\lambda }t}\right).}  [N_{B}=N_{A0}-N_{A}=N_{A0}-
      N_{A0}e^{-{\lambda }t}=N_{A0}\left(1-e^{-{\lambda }t}\right).]
The number of decays observed over a given interval obeys Poisson_statistics.
If the average number of decays is &#x27e8;N&#x27e9;, the probability of a
given number of decays N is[20]
         P ( N ) =    &#x27E8; N  &#x27E9;  N   exp &#x2061; ( &#x2212;
      &#x27E8; N &#x27E9; )   N !    .   {\displaystyle P(N)={\frac {\langle
      N\rangle ^{N}\exp(-\langle N\rangle )}{N!}}.}  [P(N)={\frac {\langle
      N\rangle ^{N}\exp(-\langle N\rangle )}{N!}}.]
*** Chain-decay processes[edit] ***
Chain of two decays
Now consider the case of a chain of two decays: one nuclide A decaying into
another B by one process, then B decaying into another C by a second process,
i.e. A â B â C. The previous equation cannot be applied to the decay chain,
but can be generalized as follows. Since A decays into B, then B decays into C,
the activity of A adds to the total number of B nuclides in the present sample,
before those B nuclides decay and reduce the number of nuclides leading to the
later sample. In other words, the number of second generation nuclei B
increases as a result of the first generation nuclei decay of A, and decreases
as a result of its own decay into the third generation nuclei C.[21] The sum of
these two terms gives the law for a decay chain for two nuclides:
             d   N  B      d  t    = &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  B    N  B   +
      &#x03BB;  A    N  A   .   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{B}}
      {\mathrm {d} t}}=-\lambda _{B}N_{B}+\lambda _{A}N_{A}.}  [{\frac {\mathrm
      {d} N_{B}}{\mathrm {d} t}}=-\lambda _{B}N_{B}+\lambda _{A}N_{A}.]
The rate of change of NB, that is dNB/dt, is related to the changes in the
amounts of A and B, NB can increase as B is produced from A and decrease as B
produces C.
Re-writing using the previous results:
       d   N  B      d  t    = &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  B    N  B   +  &#x03BB;  A
N  A 0    e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  A   t     {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d}
N_{B}}{\mathrm {d} t}}=-\lambda _{B}N_{B}+\lambda _{A}N_{A0}e^{-\lambda _{A}t}}
[{\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{B}}{\mathrm {d} t}}=-\lambda _{B}N_{B}+\lambda _{A}N_
{A0}e^{-\lambda _{A}t}]
The subscripts simply refer to the respective nuclides, i.e. NA is the number
of nuclides of type A, NA0 is the initial number of nuclides of type A, Î»A is
the decay constant for A - and similarly for nuclide B. Solving this equation
for NB gives:
          N  B   =     N  A 0    &#x03BB;  A      &#x03BB;  B   &#x2212;
      &#x03BB;  A       (   e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  A   t   &#x2212;  e
      &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  B   t    )  .   {\displaystyle N_{B}={\frac {N_
      {A0}\lambda _{A}}{\lambda _{B}-\lambda _{A}}}\left(e^{-\lambda _{A}t}-e^
      {-\lambda _{B}t}\right).}  [N_{B}={\frac {N_{A0}\lambda _{A}}{\lambda _
      {B}-\lambda _{A}}}\left(e^{-\lambda _{A}t}-e^{-\lambda _{B}t}\right).]
In the case where B is a stable nuclide (Î»B = 0), this equation reduces to the
previous solution:
          lim   &#x03BB;  B   &#x2192; 0    [      N  A 0    &#x03BB;  A
      &#x03BB;  B   &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  A       (   e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  A
      t   &#x2212;  e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  B   t    )   ]  =     N  A 0
      &#x03BB;  A     0 &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  A       (   e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;
      A   t   &#x2212; 1  )  =  N  A 0    (  1 &#x2212;  e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;
      A   t    )  ,   {\displaystyle \lim _{\lambda _{B}\rightarrow 0}\left[
      {\frac {N_{A0}\lambda _{A}}{\lambda _{B}-\lambda _{A}}}\left(e^{-\lambda
      _{A}t}-e^{-\lambda _{B}t}\right)\right]={\frac {N_{A0}\lambda _{A}}{0-
      \lambda _{A}}}\left(e^{-\lambda _{A}t}-1\right)=N_{A0}\left(1-e^{-\lambda
      _{A}t}\right),}  [\lim _{\lambda _{B}\rightarrow 0}\left[{\frac {N_
      {A0}\lambda _{A}}{\lambda _{B}-\lambda _{A}}}\left(e^{-\lambda _{A}t}-e^
      {-\lambda _{B}t}\right)\right]={\frac {N_{A0}\lambda _{A}}{0-\lambda _
      {A}}}\left(e^{-\lambda _{A}t}-1\right)=N_{A0}\left(1-e^{-\lambda _
      {A}t}\right),]
as shown above for one decay. The solution can be found by the integration
factor method, where the integrating factor is eÎ»Bt. This case is perhaps the
most useful, since it can derive both the one-decay equation (above) and the
equation for multi-decay chains (below) more directly.
Chain of any number of decays
For the general case of any number of consecutive decays in a decay chain, i.e.
A1 â A2 Â·Â·Â· â Ai Â·Â·Â· â AD, where D is the number of decays and i is
a dummy index (i = 1, 2, 3, ...D), each nuclide population can be found in
terms of the previous population. In this case N2 = 0, N3 = 0,..., ND = 0.
Using the above result in a recursive form:
             d   N  j      d  t    = &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  j    N  j   +
      &#x03BB;  j &#x2212; 1    N  ( j &#x2212; 1 ) 0    e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;
      j &#x2212; 1   t   .   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{j}}{\mathrm
      {d} t}}=-\lambda _{j}N_{j}+\lambda _{j-1}N_{(j-1)0}e^{-\lambda _{j-1}t}.}
      [{\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{j}}{\mathrm {d} t}}=-\lambda _{j}N_{j}+\lambda _
      {j-1}N_{(j-1)0}e^{-\lambda _{j-1}t}.]
The general solution to the recursive problem is given by Bateman's equations:
[22]

{i}t}}  [N_{D}={\frac {N_{1}(0)}{\lambda _{D}}}\sum _{i=1}^{D}\lambda _{i}c_
{i}e^{-\lambda _{i}t}]

{\frac {\lambda _{j}}{\lambda _{j}-\lambda _{i}}}}  [c_{i}=\prod _{j=1,i\neq
j}^{D}{\frac {\lambda _{j}}{\lambda _{j}-\lambda _{i}}}]
*** Alternative decay modes[edit] ***
In all of the above examples, the initial nuclide decays into just one product.
[23] Consider the case of one initial nuclide that can decay into either of two
products, that is A â B and A â C in parallel. For example, in a sample of
potassium-40, 89.3% of the nuclei decay to calcium-40 and 10.7% to argon-40. We
have for all time t:
         N =  N  A   +  N  B   +  N  C     {\displaystyle N=N_{A}+N_{B}+N_{C}}
      [N=N_{A}+N_{B}+N_{C}]
which is constant, since the total number of nuclides remains constant.
Differentiating with respect to time:
                 d   N  A      d  t       = &#x2212;  (      d   N  B      d  t
      +     d   N  C      d  t     )      &#x2212; &#x03BB;  N  A      =
      &#x2212;  N  A    (   &#x03BB;  B   +  &#x03BB;  C    )
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{A}}{\mathrm {d}
      t}}&=-\left({\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{B}}{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm
      {d} N_{C}}{\mathrm {d} t}}\right)\\-\lambda N_{A}&=-N_{A}\left(\lambda _
      {B}+\lambda _{C}\right)\\\end{aligned}}}  [{\begin{aligned}{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} N_{A}}{\mathrm {d} t}}&=-\left({\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{B}}
      {\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{C}}{\mathrm {d} t}}\right)\\-
      \lambda N_{A}&=-N_{A}\left(\lambda _{B}+\lambda _{C}\right)\\\end
      {aligned}}]
defining the total decay constant Î» in terms of the sum of partial decay
constants Î»B and Î»C:
         &#x03BB; =  &#x03BB;  B   +  &#x03BB;  C   .   {\displaystyle \lambda
      =\lambda _{B}+\lambda _{C}.}  [\lambda =\lambda _{B}+\lambda _{C}.]
Notice that
             d   N  A      d  t    < 0 ,     d   N  B      d  t    > 0 ,     d
      N  C      d  t    > 0.   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{A}}
      {\mathrm {d} t}}<0,{\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{B}}{\mathrm {d} t}}>0,{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} N_{C}}{\mathrm {d} t}}>0.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm
      {d} N_{A}}{\mathrm {d} t}}<0,{\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{B}}{\mathrm {d}
      t}}>0,{\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{C}}{\mathrm {d} t}}>0.}]
Solving this equation for NA:
          N  A   =  N  A 0    e  &#x2212; &#x03BB; t   .   {\displaystyle N_
      {A}=N_{A0}e^{-\lambda t}.}  [N_{A}=N_{A0}e^{-\lambda t}.]
where NA0 is the initial number of nuclide A. When measuring the production of
one nuclide, one can only observe the total decay constant Î». The decay
constants Î»B and Î»C determine the probability for the decay to result in
products B or C as follows:
          N  B   =    &#x03BB;  B   &#x03BB;    N  A 0    (  1 &#x2212;  e
      &#x2212; &#x03BB; t    )  ,   {\displaystyle N_{B}={\frac {\lambda _{B}}
      {\lambda }}N_{A0}\left(1-e^{-\lambda t}\right),}  [N_{B}={\frac {\lambda
      _{B}}{\lambda }}N_{A0}\left(1-e^{-\lambda t}\right),]
          N  C   =    &#x03BB;  C   &#x03BB;    N  A 0    (  1 &#x2212;  e
      &#x2212; &#x03BB; t    )  .   {\displaystyle N_{C}={\frac {\lambda _{C}}
      {\lambda }}N_{A0}\left(1-e^{-\lambda t}\right).}  [N_{C}={\frac {\lambda
      _{C}}{\lambda }}N_{A0}\left(1-e^{-\lambda t}\right).]
because the fraction Î»B/Î» of nuclei decay into B while the fraction Î»C/Î» of
nuclei decay into C.
**** Corollaries of the decay laws[edit] ****
The above equations can also be written using quantities related to the number
of nuclide particles N in a sample;
    * The activity: A = Î»N.
    * The amount_of_substance: n = N/L.
    * The mass: m = Mn = nN/L.
where L = 6.02214076Ã1023 molâ1[24] is the Avogadro_constant, M is the molar
mass of the substance in kg/mol, and the amount of the substance n is in moles.
**** Decay timing: definitions and relations[edit] ****
*** Time constant and mean-life[edit] ***
For the one-decay solution A â B:
         N =  N  0     e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  t   =  N  0     e  &#x2212; t  /
      &#x03C4;   ,     {\displaystyle N=N_{0}\,e^{-{\lambda }t}=N_{0}\,e^{-t/
      \tau },\,\!}  [N=N_{0}\,e^{-{\lambda }t}=N_{0}\,e^{-t/\tau },\,\!]
the equation indicates that the decay_constant Î» has units of tâ1, and can
thus also be represented as 1/Ï, where Ï is a characteristic time of the
process called the time_constant.
In a radioactive decay process, this time constant is also the mean_lifetime
for decaying atoms. Each atom "lives" for a finite amount of time before it
decays, and it may be shown that this mean lifetime is the arithmetic_mean of
all the atoms' lifetimes, and that it is Ï, which again is related to the
decay constant as follows:
         &#x03C4; =   1 &#x03BB;   .   {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {1}{\lambda
      }}.}  [\tau ={\frac {1}{\lambda }}.]
This form is also true for two-decay processes simultaneously A â B + C,
inserting the equivalent values of decay constants (as given above)
         &#x03BB; =  &#x03BB;  B   +  &#x03BB;  C      {\displaystyle \lambda
      =\lambda _{B}+\lambda _{C}\,}  [\lambda =\lambda _{B}+\lambda _{C}\,]
into the decay solution leads to:
           1 &#x03C4;   = &#x03BB; =  &#x03BB;  B   +  &#x03BB;  C   =   1
      &#x03C4;  B     +   1  &#x03C4;  C        {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\tau
      }}=\lambda =\lambda _{B}+\lambda _{C}={\frac {1}{\tau _{B}}}+{\frac {1}
      {\tau _{C}}}\,}  [{\frac {1}{\tau }}=\lambda =\lambda _{B}+\lambda _{C}=
      {\frac {1}{\tau _{B}}}+{\frac {1}{\tau _{C}}}\,]
Simulation of many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay, starting with
either 4 atoms (left) or 400 (right). The number at the top indicates how many
half-lives have elapsed.
*** Half-life[edit] ***
A more commonly used parameter is the half-life. Given a sample of a particular
radionuclide, the half-life is the time taken for half the radionuclide's atoms
to decay. For the case of one-decay nuclear reactions:
         N =  N  0     e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  t   =  N  0     e  &#x2212; t  /
      &#x03C4;   ,     {\displaystyle N=N_{0}\,e^{-{\lambda }t}=N_{0}\,e^{-t/
      \tau },\,\!}  [N=N_{0}\,e^{-{\lambda }t}=N_{0}\,e^{-t/\tau },\,\!]
the half-life is related to the decay constant as follows: set N = N0/2 and t =
T1/2 to obtain
          t  1  /  2   =    ln &#x2061; 2  &#x03BB;   = &#x03C4; ln &#x2061; 2.
      {\displaystyle t_{1/2}={\frac {\ln 2}{\lambda }}=\tau \ln 2.}  [t_{1/2}=
      {\frac {\ln 2}{\lambda }}=\tau \ln 2.]
This relationship between the half-life and the decay constant shows that
highly radioactive substances are quickly spent, while those that radiate
weakly endure longer. Half-lives of known radionuclides vary widely, from more
than 1019_years, such as for the very nearly stable nuclide 209Bi, to 10â23
seconds for highly unstable ones.
The factor of ln(2) in the above relations results from the fact that the
concept of "half-life" is merely a way of selecting a different base other than
the natural base e for the lifetime expression. The time constant Ï is the e -
1 -life, the time until only 1/e remains, about 36.8%, rather than the 50% in
the half-life of a radionuclide. Thus, Ï is longer than t1/2. The following
equation can be shown to be valid:
         N ( t ) =  N  0     e  &#x2212; t  /  &#x03C4;   =  N  0     2
      &#x2212; t  /   t  1  /  2     .     {\displaystyle N(t)=N_{0}\,e^{-t/
      \tau }=N_{0}\,2^{-t/t_{1/2}}.\,\!}  [N(t)=N_{0}\,e^{-t/\tau }=N_{0}\,2^{-
      t/t_{1/2}}.\,\!]
Since radioactive decay is exponential with a constant probability, each
process could as easily be described with a different constant time period that
(for example) gave its "(1/3)-life" (how long until only 1/3 is left) or "(1/
10)-life" (a time period until only 10% is left), and so on. Thus, the choice
of Ï and t1/2 for marker-times, are only for convenience, and from convention.
They reflect a fundamental principle only in so much as they show that the same
proportion of a given radioactive substance will decay, during any time-period
that one chooses.
Mathematically, the nth life for the above situation would be found in the same
way as aboveâby setting N = N0/n, t = T1/n and substituting into the decay
solution to obtain
          t  1  /  n   =    ln &#x2061; n  &#x03BB;   = &#x03C4; ln &#x2061; n
      .   {\displaystyle t_{1/n}={\frac {\ln n}{\lambda }}=\tau \ln n.}  [t_{1/
      n}={\frac {\ln n}{\lambda }}=\tau \ln n.]
**** Example[edit] ****
A sample of 14C has a half-life of 5,730 years and a decay rate of 14
disintegration per minute (dpm) per gram of natural carbon.
If an artifact is found to have radioactivity of 4 dpm per gram of its present
C, we can find the approximate age of the object using the above equation:
         N =  N  0     e  &#x2212; t  /  &#x03C4;   ,   {\displaystyle N=N_
      {0}\,e^{-t/\tau },}  [N=N_{0}\,e^{-t/\tau },]
where:       N  N  0     = 4  /  14 &#x2248; 0.286 ,   {\displaystyle {\frac
{N}{N_{0}}}=4/14\approx 0.286,}  [{\frac {N}{N_{0}}}=4/14\approx 0.286,]
         &#x03C4; =    T  1  /  2    ln &#x2061; 2    &#x2248; 8267
      {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {T_{1/2}}{\ln 2}}\approx 8267}  [\tau ={\frac
      {T_{1/2}}{\ln 2}}\approx 8267] years,
         t = &#x2212; &#x03C4;  ln &#x2061;   N  N  0     &#x2248; 10356
      {\displaystyle t=-\tau \,\ln {\frac {N}{N_{0}}}\approx 10356}  [
      {\displaystyle t=-\tau \,\ln {\frac {N}{N_{0}}}\approx 10356}] years.
***** Changing decay rates[edit] *****
The radioactive decay modes of electron_capture and internal_conversion are
known to be slightly sensitive to chemical and environmental effects that
change the electronic structure of the atom, which in turn affects the presence
of 1s and 2s electrons that participate in the decay process. A small number of
mostly light nuclides are affected. For example, chemical_bonds can affect the
rate of electron capture to a small degree (in general, less than 1%) depending
on the proximity of electrons to the nucleus. In 7Be, a difference of 0.9% has
been observed between half-lives in metallic and insulating environments.[25]
This relatively large effect is because beryllium is a small atom whose valence
electrons are in 2s atomic_orbitals, which are subject to electron capture in
7Be because (like all s atomic orbitals in all atoms) they naturally penetrate
into the nucleus.
In 1992, Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy-Ion Research group observed an
accelerated Î²â decay of 163Dy66+. Although neutral 163Dy is a stable
isotope, the fully ionized 163Dy66+ undergoes Î²â decay into_the_K_and_L
shells to 163Ho66+ with a half-life of 47 days.[26]
Rhenium-187 is another spectacular example. 187Re normally beta_decays to 187Os
with a half-life of 41.6 Ã 109 years,[27] but studies using fully ionised
187Re atoms (bare nuclei) have found that this can decrease to only 33 years.
This is attributed to "bound-state_Î²â_decay" of the fully ionised atom â
the electron is emitted into the "K-shell" (1s atomic orbital), which cannot
occur for neutral atoms in which all low-lying bound states are occupied.[28]
Example of diurnal and seasonal variations in gamma ray detector response.
A number of experiments have found that decay rates of other modes of
artificial and naturally occurring radioisotopes are, to a high degree of
precision, unaffected by external conditions such as temperature, pressure, the
chemical environment, and electric, magnetic, or gravitational fields.[29]
Comparison of laboratory experiments over the last century, studies of the Oklo
natural_nuclear_reactor (which exemplified the effects of thermal neutrons on
nuclear decay), and astrophysical observations of the luminosity decays of
distant supernovae (which occurred far away so the light has taken a great deal
of time to reach us), for example, strongly indicate that unperturbed decay
rates have been constant (at least to within the limitations of small
experimental errors) as a function of time as well.[citation_needed]
Recent results suggest the possibility that decay rates might have a weak
dependence on environmental factors. It has been suggested that measurements of
decay rates of silicon-32, manganese-54, and radium-226 exhibit small seasonal
variations (of the order of 0.1%).[30][31][32] However, such measurements are
highly susceptible to systematic errors, and a subsequent paper[33] has found
no evidence for such correlations in seven other isotopes (22Na, 44Ti, 108Ag,
121Sn, 133Ba, 241Am, 238Pu), and sets upper limits on the size of any such
effects. The decay of radon-222 was once reported to exhibit large 4% peak-to-
peak seasonal variations (see plot),[34] which were proposed to be related to
either solar_flare activity or the distance from the Sun, but detailed analysis
of the experiment's design flaws, along with comparisons to other, much more
stringent and systematically controlled, experiments refute this claim.[35]
**** GSI anomaly[edit] ****
Main article: GSI_anomaly
An unexpected series of experimental results for the rate of decay of heavy
highly_charged radioactive ions circulating in a storage_ring has provoked
theoretical activity in an effort to find a convincing explanation. The rates
of weak decay of two radioactive species with half lives of about 40 s and 200
s are found to have a significant oscillatory modulation, with a period of
about 7 s.[36] The observed phenomenon is known as the GSI_anomaly, as the
storage ring is a facility at the GSI_Helmholtz_Centre_for_Heavy_Ion_Research
in Darmstadt, Germany. As the decay process produces an electron_neutrino, some
of the proposed explanations for the observed rate oscillation invoke neutrino
properties. Initial ideas related to flavour_oscillation met with skepticism.
[37] A more recent proposal involves mass differences between neutrino mass
eigenstates.[38]

 to_remove_this_template_message)
The neutrons and protons that constitute nuclei, as well as other particles
that approach close enough to them, are governed by several interactions. The
strong_nuclear_force, not observed at the familiar macroscopic scale, is the
most powerful force over subatomic distances. The electrostatic_force is almost
always significant, and, in the case of beta_decay, the weak_nuclear_force is
also involved.
The combined effects of these forces produces a number of different phenomena
in which energy may be released by rearrangement of particles in the nucleus,
or else the change of one type of particle into others. These rearrangements
and transformations may be hindered energetically, so that they do not occur
immediately. In certain cases, random quantum_vacuum_fluctuations are theorized
to promote relaxation to a lower energy state (the "decay") in a phenomenon
known as quantum_tunneling. Radioactive decay half-life of nuclides has been
measured over timescales of 55 orders of magnitude, from 2.3 Ã 10â23 seconds
(for hydrogen-7) to 6.9 Ã 1031 seconds (for tellurium-128).[39] The limits of
these timescales are set by the sensitivity of instrumentation only, and there
are no known natural limits to how brief[citation_needed] or long a decay half-
life for radioactive decay of a radionuclide may be.
The decay process, like all hindered energy transformations, may be analogized
by a snowfield on a mountain. While friction between the ice crystals may be
supporting the snow's weight, the system is inherently unstable with regard to
a state of lower potential energy. A disturbance would thus facilitate the path
to a state of greater entropy; the system will move towards the ground state,
producing heat, and the total energy will be distributable over a larger number
of quantum_states thus resulting in an avalanche. The total energy does not
change in this process, but, because of the second_law_of_thermodynamics,
avalanches have only been observed in one direction and that is toward the
"ground_state" â the state with the largest number of ways in which the
available energy could be distributed.
Such a collapse (a gamma-ray decay event) requires a specific activation
energy. For a snow avalanche, this energy comes as a disturbance from outside
the system, although such disturbances can be arbitrarily small. In the case of
an excited atomic_nucleus decaying by gamma radiation in a spontaneous_emission
of electromagnetic radiation, the arbitrarily small disturbance comes from
quantum_vacuum_fluctuations.[40]
A radioactive nucleus (or any excited system in quantum mechanics) is unstable,
and can, thus, spontaneously stabilize to a less-excited system. The resulting
transformation alters the structure of the nucleus and results in the emission
of either a photon or a high-velocity particle that has mass (such as an
electron, alpha_particle, or other type).[citation_needed]
***** Occurrence and applications[edit] *****
According to the Big_Bang_theory, stable isotopes of the lightest five elements
(H, He, and traces of Li, Be, and B) were produced very shortly after the
emergence of the universe, in a process called Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis. These
lightest stable nuclides (including deuterium) survive to today, but any
radioactive isotopes of the light elements produced in the Big Bang (such as
tritium) have long since decayed. Isotopes of elements heavier than boron were
not produced at all in the Big Bang, and these first five elements do not have
any long-lived radioisotopes. Thus, all radioactive nuclei are, therefore,
relatively young with respect to the birth of the universe, having formed later
in various other types of nucleosynthesis in stars (in particular, supernovae),
and also during ongoing interactions between stable isotopes and energetic
particles. For example, carbon-14, a radioactive nuclide with a half-life of
only 5,730 years, is constantly produced in Earth's upper atmosphere due to
interactions between cosmic rays and nitrogen.
Nuclides that are produced by radioactive decay are called radiogenic_nuclides,
whether they themselves are stable or not. There exist stable radiogenic
nuclides that were formed from short-lived extinct_radionuclides in the early
solar system.[41][42] The extra presence of these stable radiogenic nuclides
(such as Xe-129 from primordial I-129) against the background of primordial
stable_nuclides can be inferred by various means.
Radioactive decay has been put to use in the technique of radioisotopic
labeling, which is used to track the passage of a chemical substance through a
complex system (such as a living organism). A sample of the substance is
synthesized with a high concentration of unstable atoms. The presence of the
substance in one or another part of the system is determined by detecting the
locations of decay events.
On the premise that radioactive decay is truly random (rather than merely
chaotic), it has been used in hardware_random-number_generators. Because the
process is not thought to vary significantly in mechanism over time, it is also
a valuable tool in estimating the absolute ages of certain materials. For
geological materials, the radioisotopes and some of their decay products become
trapped when a rock solidifies, and can then later be used (subject to many
well-known qualifications) to estimate the date of the solidification. These
include checking the results of several simultaneous processes and their
products against each other, within the same sample. In a similar fashion, and
also subject to qualification, the rate of formation of carbon-14 in various
eras, the date of formation of organic matter within a certain period related
to the isotope's half-life may be estimated, because the carbon-14 becomes
trapped when the organic matter grows and incorporates the new carbon-14 from
the air. Thereafter, the amount of carbon-14 in organic matter decreases
according to decay processes that may also be independently cross-checked by
other means (such as checking the carbon-14 in individual tree rings, for
example).
**** SzilardâChalmers effect[edit] ****
The SzilardâChalmers effect is defined as the breaking of a chemical bond
between an atom and the molecule that the atom is part of, as a result of a
nuclear reaction of the atom. The effect can be used to separate isotopes by
chemical means. The discovery of this effect is due to LeÃ³_SzilÃ¡rd and Thomas
A. Chalmers.[43]
***** Origins of radioactive nuclides[edit] *****
Main article: Nucleosynthesis
Radioactive primordial_nuclides found in the Earth are residues from ancient
supernova explosions that occurred before the formation of the solar_system.
They are the fraction of radionuclides that survived from that time, through
the formation of the primordial solar nebula, through planet accretion, and up
to the present time. The naturally occurring short-lived radiogenic
radionuclides found in today's rocks, are the daughters of those radioactive
primordial_nuclides. Another minor source of naturally occurring radioactive
nuclides are cosmogenic_nuclides, that are formed by cosmic ray bombardment of
material in the Earth's atmosphere or crust. The decay of the radionuclides in
rocks of the Earth's mantle and crust contribute significantly to Earth's
internal_heat_budget.
***** Decay chains and multiple modes[edit] *****
See also: Valley_of_stability
The daughter nuclide of a decay event may also be unstable (radioactive). In
this case, it too will decay, producing radiation. The resulting second
daughter nuclide may also be radioactive. This can lead to a sequence of
several decay events called a decay_chain (see this article for specific
details of important natural decay chains). Eventually, a stable nuclide is
produced. Any decay daughters that are the result of an alpha decay will also
result in helium atoms being created.
Gamma-ray_energy_spectrum of uranium ore (inset). Gamma-rays are emitted by
decaying nuclides, and the gamma-ray energy can be used to characterize the
decay (which nuclide is decaying to which). Here, using the gamma-ray spectrum,
several nuclides that are typical of the decay chain of 238U have been
identified: 226Ra, 214Pb, 214Bi.
An example is the natural decay chain of 238U:
    * Uranium-238 decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 4.5
      billion years to thorium-234
    * which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 24 days to
      protactinium-234
    * which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 1.2 minutes to
      uranium-234
    * which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 240 thousand
      years to thorium-230
    * which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 77 thousand
      years to radium-226
    * which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 1.6 thousand
      years to radon-222
    * which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 3.8 days to
      polonium-218
    * which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 3.1 minutes to
      lead-214
    * which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 27 minutes to
      bismuth-214
    * which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 20 minutes to
      polonium-214
    * which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 160
      microseconds to lead-210
    * which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 22 years to
      bismuth-210
    * which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 5 days to
      polonium-210
    * which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 140 days to
      lead-206, which is a stable nuclide.
Some radionuclides may have several different paths of decay. For example,
approximately 36% of bismuth-212 decays, through alpha-emission, to thallium-
208 while approximately 64% of bismuth-212 decays, through beta-emission, to
polonium-212. Both thallium-208 and polonium-212 are radioactive daughter
products of bismuth-212, and both decay directly to stable lead-208.
