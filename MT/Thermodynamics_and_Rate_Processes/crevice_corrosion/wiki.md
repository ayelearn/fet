Crevice corrosion refers to corrosion occurring in confined spaces to which the
access of the working fluid from the environment is limited. These spaces are
generally called crevices. Examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas
between parts, under gaskets or seals, inside cracks and seams, spaces filled
with deposits and under sludge piles.

***** Mechanism[edit] *****
The corrosion resistance of a stainless_steel is dependent on the presence of
an ultra-thin protective oxide film (passive film) on its surface, but it is
possible under certain conditions for this oxide film to break down, for
example in halide solutions or reducing acids. Areas where the oxide film can
break down can also sometimes be the result of the way components are designed,
for example under gaskets, in sharp re-entrant corners or associated with
incomplete weld penetration or overlapping surfaces. These can all form
crevices which can promote corrosion. To function as a corrosion site, a
crevice has to be of sufficient width to permit entry of the corrodent, but
narrow enough to ensure that the corrodent remains stagnant. Accordingly
crevice corrosion usually occurs in gaps a few micrometres wide, and is not
found in grooves or slots in which circulation of the corrodent is possible.
This problem can often be overcome by paying attention to the design of the
component, in particular to avoiding formation of crevices or at least keeping
them as open as possible. Crevice corrosion is a very similar mechanism to
pitting_corrosion; alloys resistant to one are generally resistant to both.
Crevice corrosion can be viewed as a less severe form of localized corrosion
when compared with pitting. The depth of penetration and the rate of
propagation in pitting_corrosion are significantly greater than in crevice
corrosion.
Crevices can develop a local chemistry which is very different from that of the
bulk fluid. For example, in boilers, concentration of non-volatile impurities
may occur in crevices near heat-transfer surfaces because of the continuous
water vaporization. "Concentration factors" of many millions are not uncommon
for common water impurities like sodium, sulfate or chloride. The concentration
process is often referred to as "hideout" (HO), whereas the opposite process,
whereby the concentrations tend to even out (e.g., during shutdown) is called
"hideout return" (HOR). In a neutral pH solution, the pH inside the crevice can
drop to 2, a highly acidic condition that accelerates the corrosion of most
metals and alloys.
For a given crevice type, two factors are important in the initiation of
crevice corrosion: the chemical composition of the electrolyte in the crevice
and the potential drop into the crevice. Researchers had previously claimed
that either one or the other of the two factors was responsible for initiating
crevice corrosion, but recently it has been shown that it is a combination of
the two that causes active crevice corrosion.[1] Both the potential drop and
the change in composition of the crevice electrolyte are caused by
deoxygenation of the crevice and a separation of electroactive areas, with net
anodic reactions occurring within the crevice and net cathodic reactions
occurring exterior to the crevice (on the bold surface). The ratio of the
surface areas between the cathodic and anodic region is significant.
Some of the phenomena occurring within the crevice may be somewhat reminiscent
of galvanic_corrosion:
  galvanic corrosion
      two connected metals + single environment
  crevice corrosion
      one metal part + two connected environments
The mechanism of crevice corrosion can be (but is not always) similar to that
of pitting_corrosion. However, there are sufficient differences to warrant a
separate treatment. For example, in crevice corrosion, one has to consider the
geometry of the crevice and the nature of the concentration process leading to
the development of the differential local chemistry. The extreme and often
unexpected local chemistry conditions inside the crevice need to be considered.
Galvanic effects can play a role in crevice degradation.
***** Mode of attack[edit] *****
Depending on the environment developed in the crevice and the nature of the
metal, the crevice corrosion can take a form of:
    * pitting (i.e., formation of pits),
    * filiform corrosion (this type of crevice corrosion that may occur on a
      metallic surface underneath an organic coating),
    * intergrannular attack, or
    * stress corrosion cracking.
***** Stress corrosion cracking[edit] *****
The Silver Bridge upon completion in 1928
The collapsed Silver Bridge, as seen from the Ohio side
A common form of crevice failure occurs due to stress_corrosion_cracking, where
a crack or cracks develop from the base of the crevice where the stress
concentration is greatest. This was the root cause of the fall of the Silver
Bridge in 1967 in West_Virginia, where a single critical crack only about 3 mm
long suddenly grew and fractured a tie bar joint. The rest of the bridge fell
in less than a minute. The eyebars in the Silver Bridge were not redundant, as
links were composed of only two bars each, of high strength steel (more than
twice as strong as common mild steel), rather than a thick stack of thinner
bars of modest material strength "combed" together as is usual for redundancy.
With only two bars, the failure of one could impose excessive loading on the
second, causing total failureâunlikely if more bars are used. While a low-
redundancy chain can be engineered to the design requirements, the safety is
completely dependent upon correct, high quality manufacturing and assembly.
***** Significance[edit] *****
The susceptibility to crevice corrosion varies widely from one material-
environment system to another. In general, crevice corrosion is of greatest
concern for materials which are normally passive metals, like stainless steel
or aluminum. Crevice corrosion tends to be of greatest significance to
components built of highly corrosion-resistant superalloys and operating with
the purest-available water chemistry. For example, steam_generators in nuclear
power plants degrade largely by crevice corrosion.
Crevice corrosion is extremely dangerous because it is localized and can lead
to component failure while the overall material loss is minimal. The initiation
and progress of crevice corrosion can be difficult to detect.
