****** Selective leaching ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Selective leaching, also called dealloying, demetalification, parting and
selective corrosion, is a corrosion type in some solid_solution alloys, when in
suitable conditions a component of the alloys is preferentially leached from
the material. The less noble metal is removed from the alloy by a microscopic-
scale galvanic_corrosion mechanism. The most susceptible alloys are the ones
containing metals with high distance between each other in the galvanic_series,
e.g. copper and zinc in brass. The elements most typically undergoing selective
removal are zinc, aluminium, iron, cobalt, chromium, and others.

***** Leaching of zinc[edit] *****
The most common example is selective leaching of zinc from brass alloys
containing more than 15% zinc (dezincification) in the presence of oxygen and
moisture, e.g. from brass taps in chlorine-containing water. It is believed
that both copper and zinc gradually dissolve out simultaneously, and copper
precipitates back from the solution. The material remaining is a copper-rich
sponge with poor mechanical properties, and a color changed from yellow to red.
Dezincification can be caused by water containing sulfur, carbon_dioxide, and
oxygen. Stagnant or low velocity waters tend to promote dezincification.
To combat this, arsenic or tin can be added to brass, or gunmetal can be used
instead. Dezincification resistant brass (DZR), also known as Brass C352 is an
alloy used to make pipe fittings for use with potable_water. Plumbing fittings
that are resistant to dezincification are appropriately marked, with the
letters "CR" (Corrosion Resistant) or DZR (dezincification resistant) in the
UK, and the letters "DR" (dezincification resistant) in Australia.
***** Graphitic corrosion[edit] *****

Graphitic corrosion is selective leaching of iron, from grey cast_iron, where
iron is removed and graphite grains remain intact. Affected surfaces develop a
layer of graphite, rust, and metallurgical impurities that may inhibit further
leaching. The effect can be substantially reduced by alloying the cast iron
with nickel.[1]
***** Leaching of other elements[edit] *****
Dealuminification is a corresponding process for aluminum alloys. Similar
effects for different metals are decarburization (removal of carbon from the
surface of alloy), decobaltification, denickelification, etc.
***** Countermeasures[edit] *****
Countermeasures involve using alloys not susceptible to grain_boundary
depletion, using a suitable heat_treatment, altering the environment (e.g.
lowering oxygen content), and/or use cathodic_protection.
***** Uses[edit] *****
Selective leaching can be used to produce powdered materials with extremely
high surface area, such as Raney_nickel. Selective leaching can be the pre-
final stage of depletion_gilding.
