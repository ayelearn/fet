Pitting on the Nandu_River_Iron_Bridge
Pitting corrosion, or pitting, is a form of extremely localized corrosion that
leads to the creation of small holes in the metal. The driving power for
pitting corrosion is the depassivation of a small area, which becomes anodic
while an unknown but potentially vast area becomes cathodic, leading to very
localized galvanic_corrosion. The corrosion penetrates the mass of the metal,
with a limited diffusion of ions. The mechanism of pitting corrosion is
probably the same as crevice_corrosion.

***** Mechanism[edit] *****

solution containing oxygen
The more conventional explanation for pitting corrosion is that it is an
autocatalytic process. Metal oxidation results in localized acidity that is
maintained by the spatial separation of the cathodic and anodic half-reactions,
which creates a potential gradient and electromigration of aggressive anions
into the pit.[1] For example, when a metal is present in an oxygenated NaCl
electrolyte, the pit acts as anode and the metal surface acts as cathode. The
localized production of positive metal ions in the pit gives a local excess of
positive charge which attracts the negative chlorine ions from the electrolyte
to produce charge neutrality. The pit contains a high concentration of MCl
molecules which react with water to produce HCl, the metal hydroxide, and H+
ions, accelerating the corrosion process. In the pit, the oxygen concentration
is essentially zero and all of the cathodic oxygen reactions take place on the
metal surface outside the pit. The pit is anodic and the locus of rapid
dissolution of the metal.[2] The metal corrosion initiation is autocatalytic in
nature however its propagation is not.
This kind of corrosion is extremely insidious, as it causes little loss of
material with the small effect on its surface, while it damages the deep
structures of the metal. The pits on the surface are often obscured by
corrosion products.
Pitting can be initiated by a small surface defect, being a scratch or a local
change in composition, or a damage to the protective coating. Polished surfaces
display higher resistance to pitting.
***** Susceptible alloy / environment combinations[edit] *****
Pitting Corrosion is defined by localized attack (microns - millimeters in
diameter) in an otherwise passive surface and only occurs for specific alloy /
environment combinations. Thus, this type of corrosion typically occurs in
alloys that are protected by a tenacious (passivating) oxide film such as
stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminum alloys in environments that contain
an aggressive species such as chlorides (Cl-). In contrast, alloy / environment
combinations where the passive film is not very protective usually will not
produce pitting corrosion. A good example of the importance of environment /
alloy combinations is carbon steel. In environments where the pH is less than
10, carbon steel does not form a passivating oxide film and the addition of
chloride results in uniform attack over the entire surface. However, at pH
greater than 10 (alkaline) the oxide is very protecting and the addition of
chloride results in pitting corrosion.
Besides chlorides, other anions implicated in pitting include thiosulfates
(S2O32−), fluorides and iodides. Stagnant water conditions favor pitting.
Thiosulfates are particularly aggressive species and are formed by partial
oxidation of pyrite, or partial reduction of sulfate. Thiosulfates are a
concern for corrosion in many industries: sulfide ores processing, oil_wells
and pipelines transporting soured oils, Kraft_paper production plants,
photographic industry, methionine and lysine factories.
Corrosion_inhibitors, when present in sufficient amount, will provide
protection against pitting. However, too low level of them can aggravate
pitting by forming local anodes.
***** Engineering failures due to pitting corrosion[edit] *****

A single pit in a critical point can cause a great deal of damage. One example
is the_explosion_in_Guadalajara, Mexico on April 22, 1992, when gasoline fumes
accumulated in sewers destroyed kilometers of streets. The vapors originated
from a leak of gasoline through a single hole formed by corrosion between a
steel gasoline pipe and a zinc-plated water pipe.[3] Firearms can also suffer
from pitting, most notably in the bore of the barrel when corrosive ammunition
is used and the barrel is not cleaned soon afterwards. Deformities in the bore
caused by pitting can greatly reduce the firearm's accuracy. To prevent pitting
in firearm bores, most modern firearms have a bore lined with chromium.
Pitting corrosion can also help initiate stress_corrosion_cracking, as happened
when a single eyebar on the Silver_Bridge, West_Virginia failed and ended up
killing 46 people on the bridge in December, 1967.[4]
