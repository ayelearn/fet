Physical metallurgy is one of the two main branches of the scientific approach
to metallurgy, which considers in a systematic way the physical properties of
metals and alloys. It is basically the fundamentals and applications of the
theory of phase transformations in metal and alloys, as the title of classic,
challenging monograph on the subject with this title [1]. While chemical
metallurgy involves the domain of reduction/oxidation of metals, physical
metallurgy deals mainly with mechanical and magnetic/electric/thermal
properties of metals â treated by the discipline of solid_state_physics.
Calphad methodology, able to produce Phase_diagrams which is the basis for
evaluating or estimating physical properties of metals, relies on Computational
thermodynamics i.e. on Chemical_thermodynamics and could be considered a common
and useful field for both the two sub-disciplines.
