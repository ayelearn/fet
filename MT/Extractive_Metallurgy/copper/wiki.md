Copper is a chemical_element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic
number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal
and electrical_conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a
pinkish-orange_color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as
a building_material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as
sterling_silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and
coins, and constantan used in strain_gauges and thermocouples for temperature
measurement.
Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable
metallic form (native_metals). This led to very early human use in several
regions, from c. 8000 BC. Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to
be smelted from sulfide ores, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a
shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with
another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.[4]
In the Roman_era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, the origin of the
name of the metal, from aes Ñyprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to
Ñuprum (Latin), from which the words derived, coper (Old_English) and copper,
first used around 1530.[5]
The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart
blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and
have been used widely and historically as pigments.
Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green
verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative_art, both in its
elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as
bacteriostatic_agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.
Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary_mineral because
it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome_c_oxidase.
In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment
hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other
vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone.
[6] The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 mg of copper per kilogram of
body weight.[7]

***** Characteristics *****
**** Physical ****
A copper disc (99.95% pure) made by continuous_casting; etched to reveal
crystallites
Copper just above its melting point keeps its pink luster color when enough
light outshines the orange incandescence color
Copper, silver, and gold are in group_11 of the periodic table; these three
metals have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-electron_shell and are
characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The
filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic
interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic_bonds.
Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a
covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low
hardness and high ductility of single_crystals of copper.[8] At the macroscopic
scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal_lattice, such as grain
boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby
increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-
grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline
forms.[9]
The softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity
(59.6Ã106 S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to
silver) among pure metals at room temperature.[10] This is because the
resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates
primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice,
which are relatively weak in a soft metal.[8] The maximum permissible current
density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1Ã106 A/m2 of cross-sectional
area, above which it begins to heat excessively.[11]
Copper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray
or silver.[12] Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when
exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic
transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells â the
energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.
As with other metals, if copper is put in contact with another metal, galvanic
corrosion will occur.[13]
**** Chemical ****
Unoxidized copper wire (left) and oxidized copper wire (right)
The East Tower of the Royal_Observatory,_Edinburgh. The contrast between the
refurbished copper installed in 2010 and the green color of the original 1894
copper is clearly seen.
Copper does not react with water, but it does slowly react with atmospheric
oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that
forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further
corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can
often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older
buildings[14] and the Statue_of_Liberty.[15] Copper tarnishes when exposed to
some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper_sulfides.
[16]
**** Isotopes ****
Main article: Isotopes_of_copper
There are 29 isotopes of copper. 63Cu and 65Cu are stable, with 63Cu comprising
approximately 69% of naturally occurring copper; both have a spin of
&#x200b;3⁄2.[17] The other isotopes are radioactive, with the most stable being
67Cu with a half-life of 61.83 hours.[17] Seven metastable_isotopes have been
characterized; 68mCu is the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes.
Isotopes with a mass_number above 64 decay by Î²â, whereas those with a mass
number below 64 decay by Î²+. 64Cu, which has a half-life of 12.7 hours, decays
both ways.[18]
62Cu and 64Cu have significant applications. 62Cu is used in 62Cu-PTSM as a
radioactive_tracer for positron_emission_tomography.[19]
**** Occurrence ****
See also: Copper_ores
Native copper from the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan, about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm)
long
Copper is produced in massive stars[20] and is present in the Earth's crust in
a proportion of about 50 parts per million (ppm).[21] In nature, copper occurs
in a variety of minerals, including native_copper, copper sulfides such as
chalcopyrite, bornite, digenite, covellite, and chalcocite, copper sulfosalts
such as tetrahedite-tennantite, and enargite, copper carbonates such as azurite
and malachite, and as copper(I) or copper(II) oxides such as cuprite and
tenorite, respectively.[10] The largest mass of elemental copper discovered
weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw_Peninsula in Michigan,
US.[21] Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest single crystal ever
described measuring 4.4Ã3.2Ã3.2 cm.[22]
***** Production *****
Chuquicamata, in Chile, is one of the world's largest open_pit copper mines
World production trend
Copper prices 2003â2011 in US$ per tonne
See also: List_of_countries_by_copper_production
Most copper is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open_pit_mines
in porphyry_copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include
Chuquicamata, in Chile, Bingham_Canyon_Mine, in Utah, United States, and El
Chino_Mine, in New Mexico, United States. According to the British_Geological
Survey, in 2005, Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one-third
of the world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru.[10]
Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ_leach process. Several sites
in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method.[23]
The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely
sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.[24]
**** Reserves ****
See also: Peak_copper_Â§ Reserves
Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper
ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900,[25] and more than half
was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total
amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer
of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of
extraction. However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically
viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves
available for mining vary from 25 to 60 years, depending on core assumptions
such as the growth rate.[26] Recycling is a major source of copper in the
modern world.[25] Because of these and other factors, the future of copper
production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of
peak_copper, analogous to peak_oil.
The price of copper has historically been unstable,[27] and its price increased
from the 60-year low of US$0.60/lb (US$1.32/kg) in June 1999 to $3.75 per pound
($8.27/kg) in May 2006. It dropped to $2.40/lb ($5.29/kg) in February 2007,
then rebounded to $3.50/lb ($7.71/kg) in April 2007.[28][better source needed]
In February 2009, weakening global demand and a steep fall in commodity prices
since the previous year's highs left copper prices at $1.51/lb ($3.32/kg).[29]
**** Methods ****
Main article: Copper_extraction_techniques
Scheme of flash smelting process
The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial
ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), bornite (Cu5FeS4) and, to
a lesser extent, covellite (CuS) and chalcocite (Cu2S).[30] These minerals are
concentrated from crushed ores to the level of 10â15% copper by froth
flotation or bioleaching.[31] Heating this material with silica in flash
smelting removes much of the iron as slag. The process exploits the greater
ease of converting iron sulfides into oxides, which in turn react with the
silica to form the silicate slag that floats on top of the heated mass. The
resulting copper matte, consisting of Cu2S, is roasted to convert all sulfides
into oxides:[30]
      2 Cu2S + 3 O2 â 2 Cu2O + 2 SO2
The cuprous oxide is converted to blister copper upon heating:
      2 Cu2O â 4 Cu + O2
The Sudbury matte process converted only half the sulfide to oxide and then
used this oxide to remove the rest of the sulfur as oxide. It was then
electrolytically refined and the anode mud exploited for the platinum and gold
it contained. This step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides
to copper metal. Natural_gas is blown across the blister to remove most of the
remaining oxygen and electrorefining is performed on the resulting material to
produce pure copper:[32]

**** Recycling ****
Like aluminium,[33] copper is recyclable without any loss of quality, both from
raw state and from manufactured products.[34] In volume, copper is the third
most recycled metal after iron and aluminium.[35] An estimated 80% of all
copper ever mined is still in use today.[36] According to the International
Resource_Panel's Metal_Stocks_in_Society_report, the global per capita stock of
copper in use in society is 35â55 kg. Much of this is in more-developed
countries (140â300 kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries
(30â40 kg per capita).
The process of recycling copper is roughly the same as is used to extract
copper but requires fewer steps. High-purity scrap copper is melted in a
furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots; lower-purity scrap
is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric_acid.[37]
***** Alloys *****
Copper alloys are widely used in the production of coinage; seen here are two
examples - post-1964 American dimes, which are composed of the alloy
cupronickel[38] and a pre-1968 Canadian_dime, which is composed of an alloy of
80 percent silver and 20 percent copper.[39]
See also: List_of_copper_alloys
Numerous copper alloys have been formulated, many with important uses. Brass is
an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but
can refer to any alloy of copper such as aluminium_bronze. Copper is one of the
most important constituents of silver and karat gold solders used in the
jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the
resulting alloys.[40] Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a
small proportion of copper and other metals.[41]
The alloy of copper and nickel, called cupronickel, is used in low-denomination
coins, often for the outer cladding. The US five-cent coin (currently called a
nickel) consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. Prior
to the introduction of cupronickel, which was widely adopted by countries in
the latter half of the 20th century,[42] alloys of copper and silver were also
used, with the United States using an alloy of 90% silver and 10% copper until
1965, when circulating silver was removed from all coins with the exception of
the Half dollar - these were debased to an alloy of 40% silver and 60% copper
between 1965 and 1970.[43] The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable
for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to
seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted
harbors and estuaries.[44] Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a
golden color and are used in decorations.[21] ShakudÅ is a Japanese decorative
alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold, typically 4â10%, that
can be patinated to a dark blue or black color.[45]
***** Compounds *****

See also: Category:Copper_compounds
Copper forms a rich variety of compounds, usually with oxidation_states +1 and
+2, which are often called cuprous and cupric, respectively.[46] Copper
compounds, whether organic complexes or organometallics, promote or catalyse
numerous chemical and biological processes.[47]
**** Binary compounds ****
As with other elements, the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds,
i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides,
sulfides, and halides. Both cuprous and cupric_oxides are known. Among the
numerous copper_sulfides, important examples include copper(I)_sulfide and
copper(II)_sulfide.
Cuprous halides (with chlorine, bromine, and iodine) are known, as are cupric
halides with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Attempts to prepare copper(II)
iodide yield only cuprous iodide and iodine.[46]

**** Coordination chemistry ****
Copper(II) gives a deep blue coloration in the presence of ammonia ligands. The
one used here is tetramminecopper(II)_sulfate.
Copper forms coordination_complexes with ligands. In aqueous solution, copper
(II) exists as [Cu(H2O)6]2+. This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange
rate (speed of water ligands attaching and detaching) for any transition metal
aquo_complex. Adding aqueous sodium_hydroxide causes the precipitation of light
blue solid copper(II)_hydroxide. A simplified equation is:

considered). Ion concentration 0.001 m (mol/kg water). Temperature 25 Â°C.
      Cu2+ + 2 OHâ â Cu(OH)2
Aqueous_ammonia results in the same precipitate. Upon adding excess ammonia,
the precipitate dissolves, forming tetraamminecopper(II):
      Cu(H2O)4(OH)2 + 4 NH3 â [Cu(H2O)2(NH3)4]2+ + 2 H2O + 2 OHâ
Many other oxyanions form complexes; these include copper(II)_acetate, copper
(II)_nitrate, and copper(II)_carbonate. Copper(II)_sulfate forms a blue
crystalline pentahydrate, the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory.
It is used in a fungicide called the Bordeaux_mixture.[48]
Ball-and-stick_model of the complex [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+, illustrating the
octahedral_coordination_geometry common for copper(II).
Polyols, compounds containing more than one alcohol functional_group, generally
interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for
reducing_sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's_reagent and Fehling's_solution
the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to
reddish copper(I) oxide.[49] Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with
ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose.[50] Amino_acids form very
stable chelate_complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper
ions exist, one involving potassium_ferrocyanide, which gives a brown
precipitate with copper(II) salts.
**** Organocopper chemistry ****
Main article: Organocopper_compound
Compounds that contain a carbon-copper bond are known as organocopper
compounds. They are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper(I) oxide and
have many_uses_in_chemistry. They are synthesized by treating copper(I)
compounds with Grignard_reagents, terminal_alkynes or organolithium_reagents;
[51] in particular, the last reaction described produces a Gilman_reagent.
These can undergo substitution with alkyl_halides to form coupling_products; as
such, they are important in the field of organic_synthesis. Copper(I)_acetylide
is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the
Cadiot-Chodkiewicz_coupling[52] and the Sonogashira_coupling.[53] Conjugate
addition to enones[54] and carbocupration of alkynes[55] can also be achieved
with organocopper compounds. Copper(I) forms a variety of weak complexes with
alkenes and carbon_monoxide, especially in the presence of amine ligands.[56]
**** Copper(III) and copper(IV) ****
Copper(III) is most often found in oxides. A simple example is potassium
cuprate, KCuO2, a blue-black solid.[57] The most extensively studied copper
(III) compounds are the cuprate_superconductors. Yttrium_barium_copper_oxide
(YBa2Cu3O7) consists of both Cu(II) and Cu(III) centres. Like oxide, fluoride
is a highly basic anion[58] and is known to stabilize metal ions in high
oxidation states. Both copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known,
K3CuF6 and Cs2CuF6, respectively.[46]
Some copper proteins form oxo_complexes, which also feature copper(III).[59]
With tetrapeptides, purple-colored copper(III) complexes are stabilized by the
deprotonated amide ligands.[60]
Complexes of copper(III) are also found as intermediates in reactions of
organocopper compounds.[61] For example, in the KharaschâSosnovsky_reaction.
***** History *****
A timeline of copper illustrates how the metal has advanced human civilization
for the past 11,000 years.[62]
**** Prehistoric ****
*** Copper Age ***
Main article: Copper_Age
A corroded copper ingot from Zakros, Crete, shaped in the form of an animal
skin typical in that era.
Many tools during the Chalcolithic Era included copper, such as the blade of
this replica of Ãtzi's axe
Copper ore (chrysocolla) in Cambrian sandstone from Chalcolithic mines in the
Timna_Valley, southern Israel.
Copper occurs naturally as native_metallic_copper and was known to some of the
oldest civilizations on record. The history of copper use dates to 9000 BC in
the Middle East;[63] a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to
8700 BC.[64] Evidence suggests that gold and meteoric_iron (but not smelted
iron) were the only metals used by humans before copper.[65] The history of
copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence: First, cold_working of
native copper, then annealing, smelting, and, finally, lost-wax_casting. In
southeastern Anatolia, all four of these techniques appear more or less
simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC.[66]
Copper smelting was independently invented in different places. It was probably
discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in
West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD.[67] Investment_casting was
invented in 4500â4000 BC in Southeast Asia[63] and carbon_dating has
established mining at Alderley_Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC.[68]
Ãtzi_the_Iceman, a male dated from 3300â3200 BC, was found with an axe with
a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an
involvement in copper smelting.[69] Experience with copper has assisted the
development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the
discovery of iron_smelting.[69] Production in the Old_Copper_Complex in
Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC.[70][71] Natural
bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely)
tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[72]
*** Bronze Age ***
Main article: Bronze_Age
Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years
after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000 years after "natural
bronze" had come into general use.[73] Bronze artifacts from the VinÄa_culture
date to 4500 BC.[74] Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze
alloys date to 3000 BC.[75] The Bronze_Age began in Southeastern Europe around
3700â3300 BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the
beginning of the Iron Age, 2000â1000 BC in the Near East, and 600 BC in
Northern Europe. The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age
was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period (copper-stone), when copper tools
were used with stone tools. The term has gradually fallen out of favor because
in some parts of the world, the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at
both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin.
It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze
during the Roman Empire.[75]
**** Ancient and Post-classical ****
In alchemy the symbol for copper was also the symbol for the goddess and planet
Venus.
Chalcolithic copper mine in Timna_Valley, Negev_Desert, Israel.
In Greece, copper was known by the name chalkos (ÏÎ±Î»ÎºÏÏ). It was an
important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman
times, it was known as aes Cyprium, aes being the generic Latin term for copper
alloys and Cyprium from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was
simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper. Aphrodite (Venus in Rome)
represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and
its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus was sacred to the goddess. The
seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven
metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.[76]
Copper was first used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd century BC. In
North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans.
Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle_Royale with
primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600.[77] Copper metallurgy was
flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper
burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's
commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.
The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency.
Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At
first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the
copper became more important. Julius_Caesar had his own coins made from brass,
while Octavianus_Augustus_Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With
an estimated annual output of around 15,000 t, Roman_copper_mining_and_smelting
activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the Industrial
Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus
and in Central Europe.[78][79]
The gates of the Temple_of_Jerusalem used Corinthian_bronze treated with
depletion_gilding.[clarification_needed][citation_needed] The process was most
prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy is thought to have begun.[80] In ancient
India, copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical
instruments and other medical equipment. Ancient_Egyptians (~2400 BC) used
copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later to treat headaches,
burns, and itching.
**** Modern ****

The Great_Copper_Mountain was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the
10th century to 1992. It satisfied two thirds of Europe's copper consumption in
the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's wars during that time.[81] It
was referred to as the nation's treasury; Sweden had a copper_backed_currency.
[82]
Copper is used in roofing,[14] currency, and for photographic technology known
as the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to
construct the Statue_of_Liberty; copper continues to be used in construction of
various types. Copper_plating and copper_sheathing were widely used to protect
the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty
in the 18th century.[83] The Norddeutsche_Affinerie in Hamburg was the first
modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876.[84] The German
scientist Gottfried_Osann invented powder_metallurgy in 1830 while determining
the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type
of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones.
During the rise in demand for copper for the Age of Electricity, from the 1880s
until the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States produced one third
to half the world's newly mined copper.[85] Major districts included the
Keweenaw district of northern Michigan, primarily native copper deposits, which
was eclipsed by the vast sulphide deposits of Butte,_Montana in the late 1880s,
which itself was eclipsed by porphyry deposits of the Souhwest United States,
especially at Bingham_Canyon,_Utah and Morenci,_Arizona. Introduction of open
pit steam shovel mining and innovations in smelting, refining, flotation
concentration and other processing steps led to mass production. Early in the
twentieth century, Arizona ranked first, followed by Montana, then Utah and
Michigan.[86]
Flash_smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at
Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the
world's primary copper production.[87]
The Intergovernmental_Council_of_Copper_Exporting_Countries, formed in 1967 by
Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, operated in the copper market as OPEC does in
oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the
second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was
dissolved in 1988.[88]
***** Applications *****
See also: Copper_in_renewable_energy
Assorted copper fittings
The major applications of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing and
plumbing (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure
metal, but when greater hardness is required, it is put into such alloys as
brass and bronze (5% of total use).[21] For more than two centuries, copper
paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and
shellfish.[89] A small part of the copper supply is used for nutritional
supplements and fungicides in agriculture.[48][90] Machining of copper is
possible, although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating
intricate parts.
**** Wire and cable ****
Main article: Copper_wire_and_cable
Despite competition from other materials, copper remains the preferred
electrical_conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except
overhead electric_power_transmission where aluminium is often preferred.[91]
[92] Copper wire is used in power_generation, power_transmission, power
distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of
electrical_equipment.[93] Electrical_wiring is the most important market for
the copper industry.[94] This includes structural power wiring, power
distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and
cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical
wire and cable conductors.[95] Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring
because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high
electrical_conductivity, tensile_strength, ductility, creep_(deformation)
resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal_expansion, high thermal
conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.
For a short period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, copper wiring was
replaced by aluminium_wiring in many housing construction projects in America.
The new wiring was implicated in a number of house fires and the industry
returned to copper.[96]
**** Electronics and related devices ****
Copper electrical busbars distributing power to a large building
Integrated_circuits and printed_circuit_boards increasingly feature copper in
place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat_sinks
and heat_exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation
properties. Electromagnets, vacuum_tubes, cathode_ray_tubes, and magnetrons in
microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.[97]
**** Electric motors ****
Copper's superior conductivity enhances the efficiency of electrical motors.
[98] This is important because motors and motor-driven systems account for
43%â46% of all global electricity consumption and 69% of all electricity used
by industry.[99] Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil
increases the efficiency of the motor. Copper_motor_rotors, a new technology
designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design
objectives,[100][101] are enabling general-purpose induction_motors to meet and
exceed National_Electrical_Manufacturers_Association (NEMA) premium_efficiency
standards.[102]
**** Architecture ****
Main article: Copper_in_architecture
Copper roof on the Minneapolis_City_Hall, coated with patina
Old copper utensils in a Jerusalem restaurant
Copper has been used since ancient times as a durable, corrosion_resistant, and
weatherproof architectural material.[103][104][105][106] Roofs, flashings, rain
gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from
copper for hundreds or thousands of years. Copper's architectural use has been
expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall_cladding,
building expansion_joints, radio_frequency_shielding, and antimicrobial and
decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and
counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural
material include low thermal_movement, light weight, lightning_protection, and
recyclability
The metal's distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by
architects and designers. The final patina is a particularly durable layer that
is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying
metal against further weathering.[107][108][109] It can be a mixture of
carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon
environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain.[110][111][112]
[113] Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished' to take on a
particular look, feel, or color. Finishes include mechanical surface
treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.[114]
Copper has excellent brazing and soldering properties and can be welded; the
best results are obtained with gas_metal_arc_welding.[115]
**** Antibiofouling ****
Main articles: Copper_alloys_in_aquaculture and Copper_sheathing
Copper is biostatic, meaning bacteria and many other forms of life will not
grow on it. For this reason it has long been used to line parts of ships to
protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has
since been superseded by Muntz_metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as
discussed in copper_alloys_in_aquaculture, copper alloys have become important
netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial
and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions[116] and have strong
structural and corrosion-resistant[117] properties in marine environments.
**** Antimicrobial ****
Main articles: Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper and Antimicrobial_copper-
alloy_touch_surfaces
Copper-alloy_touch_surfaces have natural properties that destroy a wide range
of microorganisms (e.g., E._coli O157:H7, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus, Clostridium_difficile, influenza_A_virus,
adenovirus, and fungi).[118] Some 355 copper alloys[clarification_needed] were
proven to kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two
hours when cleaned regularly.[119] The United_States_Environmental_Protection
Agency (EPA) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as
"antimicrobial materials with public health benefits";[119] that approval
allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of
products made of registered alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long
list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails,
handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door_knobs, toilet hardware,
computer_keyboards, health_club equipment, and shopping_cart handles (for a
comprehensive list, see: Antimicrobial_copper-alloy_touch_surfaces#Approved
products). Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of
disease, and Legionnaires'_disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing
systems.[120] Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in
healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and
Brazil[citation_needed] and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile,
where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between
2011 and 2014.[121][122][123] Textile fibers can be blended with copper to
create antimicrobial protective fabrics.[124][125]
**** Speculative investing ****
Copper may be used as a speculative investment due to the predicted increase in
use from worldwide infrastructure growth, and the important role it has in
producing wind_turbines, solar_panels, and other renewable energy sources .
[126][127] Another reason predicted demand increases is the fact that electric
cars contain an average of 3.6 times as much copper as conventional cars,
although the effect of electric_cars on copper demand is debated.[128][129]
Some people invest in copper through copper mining stocks, ETFs, and futures.
Others store physical copper in the form of copper bars or rounds although
these tend to carry a higher premium in comparison to precious metals.[130]
Those who want to avoid the premiums of copper bullion alternatively store old
copper_wire, copper_tubing or American pennies_made_before_1982.[131]
**** Folk medicine ****
Copper is commonly used in jewelry, and according to some folklore, copper
bracelets relieve arthritis symptoms.[132] In one trial for osteoarthritis and
one trial for rheumatoid arthritis no differences is found between copper
bracelet and control (non-copper) bracelet.[133][134] No evidence shows that
copper can be absorbed through the skin. If it were, it might lead to copper
poisoning.[135]
*** Compression clothing ***
Recently, some compression clothing with inter-woven copper has been marketed
with health claims similar to the folk medicine claims. Because compression
clothing is a valid treatment for some ailments, the clothing may have that
benefit, but the added copper may have no benefit beyond a placebo_effect.[136]
***** Degradation *****
Chromobacterium_violaceum and Pseudomonas_fluorescens can both mobilize solid
copper as a cyanide compound.[137] The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated
with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing
copper.[137] The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine
trees from copper toxicity. A sample of the fungus Aspergillus_niger was found
growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of
such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also plays a
role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.[138]
***** Biological role *****
Main article: Copper_in_health
Rich sources of copper include oysters, beef and lamb liver, Brazil nuts,
blackstrap molasses, cocoa, and black pepper. Good sources include lobster,
nuts and sunflower seeds, green olives, avocados, and wheat bran.
Copper_proteins have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen
transportation, processes that exploit the easy interconversion of Cu(I) and Cu
(II).[139] Copper is essential in the aerobic respiration of all eukaryotes. In
mitochondria, it is found in cytochrome_c_oxidase, which is the last protein in
oxidative_phosphorylation. Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the
O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2
molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water. Copper is also found in many
superoxide_dismutases, proteins that catalyze the decomposition of superoxides
by converting it (by disproportionation) to oxygen and hydrogen_peroxide:
    * Cu2+-SOD + O2â â Cu+-SOD + O2 (reduction of copper; oxidation of
      superoxide)
    * Cu+-SOD + O2â + 2H+ â Cu2+-SOD + H2O2 (oxidation of copper; reduction
      of superoxide)
The protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most mollusks and some
arthropods such as the horseshoe_crab (Limulus polyphemus).[140] Because
hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood
of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases
and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins
hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers.
[141] The biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in
earth's atmosphere.[142] Several copper proteins, such as the "blue copper
proteins", do not interact directly with substrates; hence they are not
enzymes. These proteins relay electrons by the process called electron
transfer.[141]
Photosynthesis functions by an elaborate electron transport chain within the
thylakoid_membrane. A central link in this chain is plastocyanin, a blue copper
protein.
A unique tetranuclear copper center has been found in nitrous-oxide_reductase.
[143]
Chemical compounds which were developed for treatment of Wilson's disease have
been investigated for use in cancer therapy.[144]
**** Dietary needs ****
Copper is an essential trace_element in plants and animals, but not all
microorganisms. The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to
2.1 mg per kg of body mass.[145] Copper is absorbed in the gut, then
transported to the liver bound to albumin.[146] After processing in the liver,
copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the
protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin
also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-
absorbed as a copper source.[147] Copper in the body normally undergoes
enterohepatic_circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in
the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some
excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver
that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.[148][149]
**** Dietary recommendations ****
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated the estimated average requirements
(EARs) and recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for copper in 2001. If there
is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate
designated Adequate_Intake (AI) is used instead. The AIs for copper are:
200 Î¼g of copper for 0â6-month-old males and females, and 220 Î¼g of copper
for 7â12-month-old males and females. The RDAs for copper are: 340 Î¼g of
copper for 1â3-year-old males, 440 Î¼g of copper for 4â8-year-old males,
700 Î¼g of copper for 9â13-year-old males, 890 Î¼g of copper for 14â18-
year-old males, and 900 Î¼g of copper for males that are 19 years old and
older. The RDAs for copper are: 340 Î¼g of copper for 1â3-year-old females,
440 Î¼g of copper for 4â8-year-old females, 700 Î¼g of copper for 9â13-
year-old females, 890 Î¼g of copper for 14â18-year-old females, and 900 Î¼g
of copper for females that are 19 years old and older. The RDAs for copper are:
1,000 Î¼g of copper for 14â50-year-old pregnant females; furthermore,
1,300 Î¼g of copper for 14â50-year-old lactating females.[150] As for safety,
the IOM also sets Tolerable_upper_intake_levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals
when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper the UL is set at 10 mg/day.
Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary_Reference
Intakes.[151]
The European_Food_Safety_Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of
information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI)
instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the
same as in United States. For women and men ages 18 and older the AIs are set
at 1.3 and 1.6 mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 1.5 mg/
day. For children ages 1â17 years the AIs increase with age from 0.7 to
1.3 mg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.[152] The European Food
Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 5 mg/day,
which is half the U.S. value.[153]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving
is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For copper labeling purposes
100% of the Daily Value was 2.0 mg, but as of May 27, 2016[update] it was
revised to 0.9 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.[154] A table of the
old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference_Daily_Intake. The
original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29,
2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1,
2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.[155]
**** Deficiency ****
Because of its role in facilitating iron uptake, copper_deficiency can produce
anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation,
impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis,
hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism.
Conversely, Wilson's_disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.
Severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper
levels, low ceruloplasmin, and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels;
these are not sensitive to marginal copper status. The "cytochrome c oxidase
activity of leucocytes and platelets" has been stated as another factor in
deficiency, but the results have not been confirmed by replication.[156]
**** Toxicity ****
Main article: Copper_toxicity
Gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and
produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and the
generation of reactive_oxygen_species that damage DNA.[157][158] Corresponding
amounts of copper salts (30 mg/kg) are toxic in animals.[159] A minimum dietary
value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 ppm in
the diet.[160] However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or
500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed_conversion
efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.[161]
Chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport
systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations
in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's
disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have
inherited two defective genes.[145]
Elevated copper levels have also been linked to worsening symptoms of
Alzheimer's_disease.[162][163]
**** Human exposure ****
In the US, the Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration (OSHA) has
designated a permissible_exposure_limit (PEL) for copper dust and fumes in the
workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1 mg/m3. The National_Institute
for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended_exposure_limit
(REL) of 1 mg/m3, time-weighted average. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to
life and health) value is 100 mg/m3.[164]
Copper is a constituent of tobacco_smoke.[165][166] The tobacco_plant readily
absorbs and accumulates heavy_metals, such as copper from the surrounding soil
into its leaves. These are readily absorbed into the user's body following
smoke inhalation.[167] The health implications are not clear.[168]
