Lead (/Ã‹ÂˆlÃ‰Â›d/) is a chemical_element with the symbol Pb (from the Latin
plumbum) and atomic_number 82. It is a heavy_metal that is denser than most
common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and also has a relatively low
melting_point. When freshly cut, lead is silvery with a hint of blue; it
tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic
number of any stable_element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major
nuclear decay_chains of heavier elements.
Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition_metal. Its weak metallic
character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead_oxides react
with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent_bonds. Compounds_of_lead
are usually found in the +2 oxidation_state rather than the +4 state common
with lighter members of the carbon_group. Exceptions are mostly limited to
organolead_compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond
with_itself; it can form chains and polyhedral structures.
Lead is easily extracted from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew
of_it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which
helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient_Rome. Lead
production declined after the fall_of_Rome and did not reach comparable levels
until the Industrial_Revolution. In 2014, the annual global production of lead
was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's
high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation
make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low
cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries,
bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible_alloys, white_paints,
leaded_gasoline, and radiation_shielding.
In the late 19th century, lead's_toxicity was recognized, and its use has since
been phased out of many applications. However, many countries still allow the
sale of products that expose humans to lead, including some types of paints and
bullets. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones; it
damages the nervous_system and interferes with the function of biological
enzymes, causing neurological disorders, such as brain damage and behavioral
problems.

***** Physical properties[edit] *****
**** Atomic[edit] ****
A lead atom has 82 electrons, arranged in an electron_configuration of
[Xe]4f145d106s26p2. The sum of lead's first and second ionization
energiesÃ¢Â€Â”the total energy required to remove the two 6p electronsÃ¢Â€Â”is close
to that of tin, lead's upper neighbor in the carbon_group. This is unusual;
ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer
electrons become more distant from the nucleus, and more shielded by smaller
orbitals. The similarity of ionization energies is caused by the lanthanide
contractionÃ¢Â€Â”the decrease in element radii from lanthanum (atomic number 57)
to lutetium (71), and the relatively small radii of the elements from hafnium
(72) onwards. This is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide 4f
electrons. The sum of the first four ionization energies of lead exceeds that
of tin,[3] contrary to what periodic_trends would predict. Relativistic
effects, which become significant in heavier atoms, contribute to this
behavior.[a] One such effect is the inert_pair_effect: the 6s electrons of lead
become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the distance between nearest
atoms in crystalline lead unusually long.[5]
Lead's lighter carbon group congeners form stable or metastable allotropes with
the tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently_bonded diamond_cubic structure.
The energy levels of their outer s- and p-orbitals are close enough to allow
mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases
the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by
the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization.[6]
Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms metallic_bonds in
which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb2+ ions.
Lead consequently has a face-centered_cubic structure[7] like the similarly
sized[8] divalent metals calcium and strontium.[9][b][c][d]
**** Bulk[edit] ****
Pure lead has a bright, silvery appearance with a hint of blue.[14] It
tarnishes on contact with moist air and takes on a dull appearance, the hue of
which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead
include high density, malleability, ductility, and high resistance to corrosion
due to passivation.[15]
[A_disk_of_metal]
A sample of lead solidified from the molten state
Lead's close-packed face-centered cubic structure and high atomic weight result
in a density[16] of 11.34Â g/cm3, which is greater than that of common metals
such as iron (7.87Â g/cm3), copper (8.93Â g/cm3), and zinc (7.14Â g/cm3).[17] This
density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon.[18][19][e]
Some rarer metals are denser: tungsten and gold are both at 19.3Â g/cm3, and
osmiumÃ¢Â€Â”the densest metal knownÃ¢Â€Â”has a density of 22.59Â g/cm3, almost twice
that of lead.[20]
Lead is a very soft metal with a Mohs_hardness of 1.5; it can be scratched with
a fingernail.[21] It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile.[22][f] The bulk
modulus of leadÃ¢Â€Â”a measure of its ease of compressibilityÃ¢Â€Â”is 45.8Â GPa. In
comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2Â GPa; copper 137.8Â GPa; and mild_steel
160Ã¢Â€Â“169Â GPa.[23] Lead's tensile_strength, at 12Ã¢Â€Â“17 MPa, is low (that of
aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher);
it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.[24]
The melting point of leadÃ¢Â€Â”at 327.5Â Ã‚Â°C (621.5Â Ã‚Â°F)[25]Ã¢Â€Â”is very low compared
to most metals.[16][g] Its boiling_point of 1749Â Ã‚Â°C (3180Â Ã‚Â°F)[25] is the
lowest among the carbon group elements. The electrical_resistivity of lead at
20Â Ã‚Â°C is 192 nanoohm-meters, almost an order_of_magnitude higher than those of
other industrial metals (copper at 15.43Â nÃÂ©Ã‚Â·m; gold 20.51Â nÃÂ©Ã‚Â·m; and
aluminium at 24.15Â nÃÂ©Ã‚Â·m).[27] Lead is a superconductor at temperatures lower
than 7.19Â K;[28] this is the highest critical_temperature of all type-
I_superconductors and the third highest of the elemental superconductors.[29]

**** Isotopes[edit] ****
Main article: Isotopes_of_lead
Natural lead consists of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206,
207, and 208,[30] and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes.[31] The high
number of isotopes is consistent with lead's atomic_number being even.[h] Lead
has a magic_number of protons (82), for which the nuclear_shell_model
accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus.[32] Lead-208 has 126
neutrons, another magic number, which may explain why lead-208 is
extraordinarily stable.[32]
With its high atomic number, lead is the heaviest element whose natural
isotopes are regarded as stable; lead-208 is the heaviest stable nucleus. (This
distinction formerly fell to bismuth, with an atomic number of 83, until its
only primordial_isotope, bismuth-209, was found in 2003 to decay very slowly.)
[i] The four stable isotopes of lead could theoretically undergo alpha_decay to
isotopes of mercury with a release of energy, but this has not been observed
for any of them; their predicted half-lives range from 1035 to 10189 years[35]
(at least 1025 times the current age of the universe).
Three of the stable isotopes are found in three of the four major decay_chains:
lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208 are the final decay products of uranium-238,
uranium-235, and thorium-232, respectively.[36] These decay chains are called
the uranium chain, the actinium chain, and the thorium chain.[37] Their
isotopic concentrations in a natural rock sample depends greatly on the
presence of these three parent uranium and thorium isotopes. For example, the
relative abundance of lead-208 can range from 52% in normal samples to 90% in
thorium ores;[38] for this reason, the standard atomic weight of lead is given
to only one decimal place.[39] As time passes, the ratio of lead-206 and lead-
207 to lead-204 increases, since the former two are supplemented by radioactive
decay of heavier elements while the latter is not; this allows for leadÃ¢Â€Â“lead
dating. As uranium decays into lead, their relative amounts change; this is the
basis for uraniumÃ¢Â€Â“lead_dating.[40] Lead-207 exhibits nuclear_magnetic
resonance, a property that has been used to study its compounds in solution and
solid state,[41][42] including in human body.[43]
[A_piece_of_a_gray_meteorite_on_a_pedestal]
The Holsinger meteorite, the largest piece of the Canyon_Diablo meteorite.
UraniumÃ¢Â€Â“lead_dating and leadÃ¢Â€Â“lead_dating on this meteorite allowed
refinement of the age_of_the_Earth to 4.55Â billion Ã‚Â±Â 70Â million years.
Apart from the stable isotopes, which make up almost all lead that exists
naturally, there are trace_quantities of a few radioactive isotopes. One of
them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years,[30] small
quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series
that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on
Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 are present in the decay chains of uranium-
235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of
these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from
the very rare cluster_decay of radium-223, one of the daughter_products of
natural uranium-235, and the decay chain of neptunium-237, traces of which are
produced by neutron_capture in uranium ores. Lead-210 is particularly useful
for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206
(both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).[44]
In total, 43 lead isotopes have been synthesized, with mass numbers 178Ã¢Â€Â“220.
[30] Lead-205 is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of around
1.73ÃƒÂ—107Â years.[j] The second-most stable is lead-202, which has a half-life
of about 52,500Â years, longer than any of the natural trace radioisotopes.[30]

Flame_test: lead colors flame pale blue
Bulk lead exposed to moist air forms a protective layer of varying composition.
Lead(II)_carbonate is a common constituent;[46][47][48] the sulfate or chloride
may also be present in urban or maritime settings.[49] This layer makes bulk
lead effectively chemically inert in the air.[49] Finely powdered lead, as with
many metals, is pyrophoric,[50] and burns with a bluish-white flame.[51]
Fluorine reacts with lead at room temperature, forming lead(II)_fluoride. The
reaction with chlorine is similar but requires heating, as the resulting
chloride layer diminishes the reactivity of the elements.[49] Molten lead
reacts with the chalcogens to give lead(II) chalcogenides.[52]
Lead metal resists sulfuric and phosphoric_acid but not hydrochloric or nitric
acid; the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent passivation of the
product salt.[53] Organic acids, such as acetic_acid, dissolve lead in the
presence of oxygen.[49] Concentrated alkalis will dissolve lead and form
plumbites.[54]
**** Inorganic compounds[edit] ****
See also: Compounds_of_lead
Lead shows two main oxidation states: +4 and +2. The tetravalent state is
common for the carbon group. The divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon,
minor for germanium, important (but not prevailing) for tin, and is the more
important of the two oxidation states for lead.[49] This is attributable to
relativistic_effects, specifically the inert_pair_effect, which manifests
itself when there is a large difference in electronegativity between lead and
oxide, halide, or nitride anions, leading to a significant partial positive
charge on lead. The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital
than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds.
The inert pair effect is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms
covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity, such as carbon in
organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized
and sp3 hybridization is still energetically favorable. Lead, like carbon, is
predominantly tetravalent in such compounds.[55]
There is a relatively large difference in the electronegativity of lead(II) at
1.87 and lead(IV) at 2.33. This difference marks the reversal in the trend of
increasing stability of the +4 oxidation state going down the carbon group;
tin, by comparison, has values of 1.80 in the +2 oxidation state and 1.96 in
the +4 state.[56]

Lead(II)_oxide
*** Lead(II)[edit] ***
Lead(II) compounds are characteristic of the inorganic chemistry of lead. Even
strong oxidizing_agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only
PbF2 and PbCl2.[49] Lead(II) ions are usually colorless in solution,[57] and
partially hydrolyze to form Pb(OH)+ and finally [Pb4(OH)4]4+ (in which the
hydroxyl ions act as bridging_ligands),[58][59] but are not reducing_agents as
tin(II) ions are. Techniques for identifying the presence of the Pb2+ ion in
water generally rely on the precipitation of lead(II) chloride using dilute
hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is sparingly soluble in water, in very
dilute solutions the precipitation of lead(II) sulfide is achieved by bubbling
hydrogen_sulfide through the solution.[60]
Lead_monoxide exists in two polymorphs, litharge ÃÂ±-PbO (red) and massicot ÃÂ²-
PbO (yellow), the latter being stable only above around 488Â Ã‚Â°C. Litharge is
the most commonly used inorganic compound of lead.[61] There is no lead(II)
hydroxide; increasing the pH of solutions of lead(II) salts leads to hydrolysis
and condensation.[62] Lead commonly reacts with heavier chalcogens. Lead
sulfide is a semiconductor, a photoconductor, and an extremely sensitive
infrared_radiation_detector. The other two chalcogenides, lead_selenide and
lead_telluride, are likewise photoconducting. They are unusual in that their
color becomes lighter going down the group.[63]

Lead dihalides are well-characterized; this includes the diastatide[64] and
mixed halides, such as PbFCl. The relative insolubility of the latter forms a
useful basis for the gravimetric determination of fluorine. The difluoride was
the first solid ionically_conducting compound to be discovered (in 1834, by
Michael_Faraday).[65] The other dihalides decompose on exposure to ultraviolet
or visible light, especially the diiodide.[66] Many lead(II) pseudohalides are
known, such as the cyanide, cyanate, and thiocyanate.[63][67] Lead(II) forms an
extensive variety of halide coordination_complexes, such as [PbCl4]2Ã¢ÂˆÂ’,
[PbCl6]4Ã¢ÂˆÂ’, and the [Pb2Cl9]n5nÃ¢ÂˆÂ’ chain anion.[66]
Lead(II)_sulfate is insoluble in water, like the sulfates of other heavy
divalent cations. Lead(II) nitrate and lead(II)_acetate are very soluble, and
this is exploited in the synthesis of other lead compounds.[68]
*** Lead(IV)[edit] ***
Few inorganic lead(IV) compounds are known. They are only formed in highly
oxidizing solutions and do not normally exist under standard conditions.[69]
Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It is described
as lead(II,IV)_oxide, or structurally 2PbOÃ‚Â·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed
valence lead compound. Lead_dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of
oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas.[70] This is because the expected
PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2
and Cl2.[71] Analogously to lead_monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming
plumbate anions. Lead_disulfide[72] and lead diselenide[73] are only stable at
high pressures. Lead_tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but
less so than the difluoride. Lead_tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at
room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, and the existence of
lead tetraiodide is questionable.[74]

*** Other oxidation states[edit] ***
See also: Plumbide
Some lead compounds exist in formal oxidation states other than +4 or +2. Lead
(III) may be obtained, as an intermediate between lead(II) and lead(IV), in
larger organolead complexes; this oxidation state is not stable, as both the
lead(III) ion and the larger complexes containing it are radicals.[76][77][78]
The same applies for lead(I), which can be found in such radical species.[79]
Numerous mixed lead(II,IV) oxides are known. When PbO2 is heated in air, it
becomes Pb12O19 at 293Â Ã‚Â°C, Pb12O17 at 351Â Ã‚Â°C, Pb3O4 at 374Â Ã‚Â°C, and finally
PbO at 605Â Ã‚Â°C. A further sesquioxide, Pb2O3, can be obtained at high pressure,
along with several non-stoichiometric phases. Many of them show defective
fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies: PbO
can be considered as having such a structure, with every alternate layer of
oxygen atoms absent.[80]
Negative oxidation states can occur as Zintl_phases, as either free lead
anions, as in Ba2Pb, with lead formally being lead(Ã¢ÂˆÂ’IV),[81] or in oxygen-
sensitive ring-shaped or polyhedral cluster ions such as the trigonal
bipyramidal Pb52Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ ion, where two lead atoms are lead(Ã¢ÂˆÂ’I) and three are lead
(0).[82] In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes
two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp3 hybrid
orbitals, the other two being an external lone_pair.[58] They may be made in
liquid_ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium.[83]

**** Organolead[edit] ****
Main article: Organolead_compound
Lead can form multiply-bonded_chains, a property it shares with its lighter
homologs in the carbon group. Its capacity to do so is much less because the
PbÃ¢Â€Â“Pb bond_energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the CÃ¢Â€Â“C
bond.[52] With itself, lead can build metalÃ¢Â€Â“metal bonds of an order up to
three.[84] With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but
generally less stable than, typical organic compounds[85] (due to the PbÃ¢Â€Â“C
bond being rather weak).[58] This makes the organometallic_chemistry of lead
far less wide-ranging than that of tin.[86] Lead predominantly forms organolead
(IV) compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few
organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are
Pb[CH(SiMe3)2]2 and Pb(ÃÂ·5-C5H5)2.[86]
The lead analog of the simplest organic_compound, methane, is plumbane.
Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic
hydrogen.[87] Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are
the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable:
tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated[88] or if exposed to sunlight
or ultraviolet light.[89] (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable,
decomposing at 270Â Ã‚Â°C.[86]) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar
alloy that reacts with alkyl_halides to form organometallic compounds such as
tetraethyllead.[90] The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is
usefully exploited: lead_tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for
oxidation in organic synthesis,[91] and tetraethyllead was once produced in
larger quantities than any other organometallic compound.[86] Other organolead
compounds are less chemically stable.[85] For many organic compounds, a lead
analog does not exist.[87]

**** In space[edit] ****
Lead's per-particle abundance in the Solar_System is 0.121 ppb (parts per
billion).[92][k] This figure is two and a half times higher than that of
platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold.
[92] The amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing[93] as most
heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead.[94] The
abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago
has increased by about 0.75%.[95] The solar system abundances table shows that
lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent than most
other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.[92]
Primordial leadÃ¢Â€Â”which comprises the isotopes lead-204, lead-206, lead-207,
and lead-208Ã¢Â€Â”was mostly created as a result of repetitive neutron capture
processes occurring in stars. The two main modes of capture are the s- and r-
processes.[96]
In the s-process (s is for "slow"), captures are separated by years or decades,
allowing less stable nuclei to undergo beta_decay.[97] A stable thallium-203
nucleus can capture a neutron and become thallium-204; this undergoes beta
decay to give stable lead-204; on capturing another neutron, it becomes lead-
205, which has a half-life of around 15 million years. Further captures result
in lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208. On capturing another neutron, lead-208
becomes lead-209, which quickly decays into bismuth-209. On capturing another
neutron, bismuth-209 becomes bismuth-210, and this beta decays to polonium-210,
which alpha decays to lead-206. The cycle hence ends at lead-206, lead-207,
lead-208, and bismuth-209.[98]

Chart of the final part of the s-process, from mercury to polonium. Red lines
and circles represent neutron_captures; blue arrows represent beta_decays; the
green arrow represents an alpha_decay; cyan arrows represent electron_captures.
In the r-process (r is for "rapid"), captures happen faster than nuclei can
decay.[99] This occurs in environments with a high neutron density, such as a
supernova or the merger of two neutron_stars. The neutron flux involved may be
on the order of 1022 neutrons per square centimeter per second.[100] The r-
process does not form as much lead as the s-process.[101] It tends to stop once
neutron-rich nuclei reach 126 neutrons.[102] At this point, the neutrons are
arranged in complete shells in the atomic nucleus, and it becomes harder to
energetically accommodate more of them.[103] When the neutron flux subsides,
these nuclei beta decay into stable isotopes of osmium, iridium, and platinum.
[104]
**** On Earth[edit] ****
Lead is classified as a chalcophile under the Goldschmidt_classification,
meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur.[105] It rarely occurs in
its native, metallic form.[106] Many lead minerals are relatively light and,
over the course of the Earth's history, have remained in the crust instead of
sinking deeper into the Earth's interior. This accounts for lead's relatively
high crustal_abundance of 14 ppm; it is the 38th most abundant element in the
crust.[107][l]
The main lead-bearing mineral is galena (PbS), which is mostly found with zinc
ores.[109] Most other lead minerals are related to galena in some way;
boulangerite, Pb5Sb4S11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; anglesite,
PbSO4, is a product of galena oxidation; and cerussite or white lead ore,
PbCO3, is a decomposition product of galena. Arsenic, tin, antimony, silver,
gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.[109]
[A_line_chart_generally_declining_towards_its_right]
Lead is a fairly common element in the Earth's_crust for its high atomic number
(82). Most elements of atomic number greater than 40 are less abundant.
World lead resources exceed two billion tons. Significant deposits are located
in Australia, China, Ireland, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Russia, and the United
States. Global reservesÃ¢Â€Â”resources that are economically feasible to
extractÃ¢Â€Â”totaled 88 million tons in 2016, of which Australia had 35 million,
China 17 million, and Russia 6.4 million.[110]
Typical background concentrations of lead do not exceed 0.1Â ÃÂ¼g/m3 in the
atmosphere; 100Â mg/kg in soil; and 5Â ÃÂ¼g/L in freshwater and seawater.[111]
***** Etymology[edit] *****
The modern English word "lead" is of Germanic origin; it comes from the Middle
English leed and Old_English lÃ„Â“ad (with the macron above the "e" signifying
that the vowel sound of that letter is long).[112] The Old English word is
derived from the hypothetical reconstructed Proto-Germanic *lauda- ("lead").
[113] According to linguistic theory, this word bore descendants in multiple
Germanic languages of exactly the same meaning.[113]
The origin of the Proto-Germanic *lauda- is not agreed in the linguistic
community. One hypothesis suggests it is derived from Proto-Indo-European
*lAudh- ("lead"; capitalization of the vowel is equivalent to the macron).[114]
Another hypothesis suggests it is borrowed from Proto-Celtic *Ã‰Â¸loud-io-
("lead"). This word is related to the Latin plumbum, which gave the element its
chemical_symbol Pb. The word *Ã‰Â¸loud-io- is thought to be the origin of Proto-
Germanic *bliwa- (which also means "lead"), from which stemmed the German Blei.
[115]
The name of the chemical element is not related to the verb of the same
spelling, which is derived from Proto-Germanic *laidijan- ("to lead").[116]
***** History[edit] *****
[A_line_chart_generally_growing_to_its_right]
World lead production peaking in the Roman period and the Industrial
Revolution.[117]
**** Prehistory and early history[edit] ****
Metallic lead beads dating_back_to_7000Ã¢Â€Â“6500_BCE have been found in Asia
Minor and may represent the first example of metal smelting.[118] At that time
lead had few (if any) applications due to its softness and dull appearance.
[118] The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association
with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena (a common lead mineral).
[119] The Ancient_Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics,
an application that spread to Ancient_Greece and beyond;[120] the Egyptians may
have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for
ornaments.[119] Various civilizations of the Fertile_Crescent used lead as a
writing material, as currency, and as a construction material.[119] Lead was
used in the Ancient_Chinese royal court as a stimulant,[119] as currency,[121]
and as a contraceptive;[122] the Indus_Valley_civilization and the
Mesoamericans[119] used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern
African peoples used lead in wire_drawing.[123]
**** Classical era[edit] ****
Because silver was extensively used as a decorative material and an exchange
medium, lead deposits came to be worked in Asia Minor from 3000Â BCE; later,
lead deposits were developed in the Aegean and Laurion. These three regions
collectively dominated production of mined lead until c. 1200Â BCE.[124]
Beginning circa 2000Â BCE, the Phoenicians worked deposits in the Iberian
peninsula; by 1600Â BCE, lead mining existed in Cyprus, Greece, and Sardinia.
[125]
Ancient Greek lead sling bullets with a winged thunderbolt molded on one side
and the inscription "ÃÂ”ÃÂ•ÃÂÃÂ‘ÃÂ™" ("take that" or "catch") on the other side
[126]
Rome's territorial expansion in Europe and across the Mediterranean, and its
development of mining, led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during
the classical_era, with an estimated annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes.
Like their predecessors, the Romans obtained lead mostly as a by-product of
silver smelting.[117][127] Lead_mining occurred in Central_Europe, Britain, the
Balkans, Greece, Anatolia, and Hispania, the latter accounting for 40% of world
production.[117]
Lead tablets were commonly used as a material for letters.[128] Lead_coffins,
cast in flat sand forms, with interchangeable motifs to suit the faith of the
deceased were used in ancient Judea.[129]
Lead was used for making water_pipes in the Roman_Empire; the Latin word for
the metal, plumbum, is the origin of the English word "plumbing". Its ease of
working and resistance to corrosion[130] ensured its widespread use in other
applications, including pharmaceuticals, roofing, currency, and warfare.[131]
[132][133] Writers of the time, such as Cato_the_Elder, Columella, and Pliny
the_Elder, recommended lead (or lead-coated) vessels for the preparation of
sweeteners_and_preservatives added to wine and food. The lead conferred an
agreeable taste due to the formation of "sugar of lead" (lead(II) acetate),
whereas copper or bronze vessels could impart a bitter flavor through verdigris
formation.[134]
This metal was by far the most used material in classical antiquity, and it is
appropriate to refer to the (Roman) Lead Age. Lead was to the Romans what
plastic is to us.
Heinz Eschnauer and Markus Stoeppler
"WineÃ¢Â€Â”An enological specimen bank", 1992[135]
The Roman author Vitruvius reported the health dangers of lead[136] and modern
writers have suggested that lead poisoning played a major role in the decline
of the Roman Empire.[137][138][m] Other researchers have criticized such
claims, pointing out, for instance, that not all abdominal pain is caused by
lead poisoning.[140][141] According to archaeological research, Roman lead
pipes increased lead levels in tap water but such an effect was "unlikely to
have been truly harmful".[142][143] When lead poisoning did occur, victims were
called "saturnine", dark and cynical, after the ghoulish father of the gods,
Saturn. By association, lead was considered the father of all metals.[144] Its
status in Roman society was low as it was readily available[145] and cheap.

*** Confusion with tin and antimony[edit] ***
During the classical era (and even up to the 17th century), tin was often not
distinguished from lead: Romans called lead plumbum nigrum ("black lead"), and
tin plumbum candidum ("bright lead"). The association of lead and tin can be
seen in other languages: the word olovo in Czech translates to "lead", but in
Russian, its cognate ÃÂ¾ÃÂ»ÃÂ¾ÃÂ²ÃÂ¾ (olovo) means "tin".[147] To add to the
confusion, lead bore a close relation to antimony: both elements commonly occur
as sulfides (galena and stibnite), often together. Pliny incorrectly wrote that
stibnite would give lead on heating, instead of antimony.[148] In countries
such as Turkey and India, the originally Persian name surma came to refer to
either antimony sulfide or lead sulfide,[149] and in some languages, such as
Russian, gave its name to antimony (Ã‘ÂÃ‘ÂƒÃ‘Â€Ã‘ÂŒÃÂ¼ÃÂ°).[150]
**** Middle Ages and the Renaissance[edit] ****
Lead mining in Western Europe declined after the fall of the Western_Roman
Empire, with Arabian_Iberia being the only region having a significant output.
[151][152] The largest production of lead occurred in South and East Asia,
especially China and India, where lead mining grew rapidly.[152]
[A_white-faced_woman_in_red_clothes]
Elizabeth_I_of_England was commonly depicted with a whitened face. Lead in face
whiteners is thought to have contributed to her death.[153]
In Europe, lead production began to increase in the 11th and 12th centuries,
when it was again used for roofing and piping. Starting in the 13th century,
lead was used to create stained_glass.[154] In the European and Arabian
traditions of alchemy, lead (symbol [Saturn_symbol.svg] in the European
tradition)[155] was considered an impure base_metal which, by the separation,
purification and balancing of its constituent essences, could be transformed to
pure and incorruptible gold.[156] During the period, lead was used increasingly
for adulterating wine. The use of such wine was forbidden for use in Christian
rites by a papal_bull in 1498, but it continued to be imbibed and resulted in
mass poisonings up to the late 18th century.[151][157] Lead was a key material
in parts of the printing_press, which was invented around 1440; lead dust was
commonly inhaled by print workers, causing lead poisoning.[158] Firearms were
invented at around the same time, and lead, despite being more expensive than
iron, became the chief material for making bullets. It was less damaging to
iron gun barrels, had a higher density (which allowed for better retention of
velocity), and its lower melting point made the production of bullets easier as
they could be made using a wood fire.[159] Lead, in the form of Venetian
ceruse, was extensively used in cosmetics by Western European aristocracy as
whitened faces were regarded as a sign of modesty.[160][161] This practice
later expanded to white wigs and eyeliners, and only faded out with the French
Revolution in the late 18th century. A similar fashion appeared in Japan in the
18th century with the emergence of the geishas, a practice that continued long
into the 20th century. The white faces of women "came to represent their
feminine virtue as Japanese women",[162] with lead commonly used in the
whitener.[163]
**** Outside Europe and Asia[edit] ****
In the New_World, lead production was recorded soon after the arrival of
European settlers. The earliest record dates to 1621 in the English Colony_of
Virginia, fourteen years after its foundation.[164] In Australia, the first
mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine, in 1841.[165] In
Africa, lead mining and smelting were known in the Benue_Trough[166] and the
lower Congo_Basin, where lead was used for trade with Europeans, and as a
currency by the 17th century,[167] well before the scramble_for_Africa.
[A_black-and-white_drawing_of_men_working_in_a_mine]
Lead mining in the upper Mississippi_River region in the United States in 1865
**** Industrial Revolution[edit] ****
In the second half of the 18th century, Britain, and later continental Europe
and the United States, experienced the Industrial_Revolution. This was the
first time during which lead production rates exceeded those of Rome.[117]
Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century
with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany,
Spain, and the United States.[168] By 1900, the United States was the leader in
global lead production, and other non-European nationsÃ¢Â€Â”Canada, Mexico, and
AustraliaÃ¢Â€Â”had begun significant production; production outside Europe
exceeded that within.[169] A great share of the demand for lead came from
plumbing and paintingÃ¢Â€Â”lead_paints were in regular use.[170] At this time,
more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases
escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was
proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead
poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred_Baring_Garrod noted a
third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic
ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th
century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were
enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.[170]

**** Modern era[edit] ****
Further evidence of the threat that lead posed to humans was discovered in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries. Mechanisms of harm were better understood,
lead blindness was documented, and the element was phased out of public use in
the United States and Europe. The United Kingdom introduced mandatory factory
inspections in 1878 and appointed the first Medical Inspector of Factories in
1898; as a result, a 25-fold decrease in lead poisoning incidents from 1900 to
1944 was reported.[171] Most European countries banned lead paintÃ¢Â€Â”commonly
used because of its opacity and water resistance[172]Ã¢Â€Â”for interiors by 1930.
[173]
The last major human exposure to lead was the addition of tetraethyllead to
gasoline as an antiknock_agent, a practice that originated in the United States
in 1921. It was phased out in the United States and the European_Union by 2000.
[170]
In the 1970s, the United States and Western European countries introduced
legislation to reduce lead air pollution.[174][175] The impact was significant:
while a study conducted by the Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention in
the United States in 1976Ã¢Â€Â“1980 showed that 77.8% of the population had
elevated blood_lead_levels, in 1991Ã¢Â€Â“1994, a study by the same institute
showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2%.[176] The main
product made of lead by the end of the 20th century was the leadÃ¢Â€Â“acid
battery,[177] which posed no direct threat to humans.
From 1960 to 1990, lead output in the Western_Bloc grew by about 31%.[178] The
share of the world's lead production by the Eastern_Bloc increased from 10% to
30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the Soviet_Union being the world's largest
producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major lead
production in the late 20th century.[179] Unlike the European communist
countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004,
China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead.[180] As was the case
during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in
China.[181]
***** Production[edit] *****
[A_line_chart_of_many_lines,_some_longer_than_other,_most_generally_growing
towards_its_right]
Primary production of lead since 1840
As of 2014, production of lead is increasing worldwide due to its use in
leadÃ¢Â€Â“acid batteries.[182] There are two major categories of production:
primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58Â million metric
tons came from primary production and 5.64Â million from secondary production.
The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China,
Australia, and the United States.[110] The top three producers of refined lead
were China, the United States, and India.[183] According to the International
Resource_Panel's Metal_Stocks_in_Society_report of 2010, the total amount of
lead in use, stockpiled, discarded, or dissipated into the environment, on a
global basis, is 8Â kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries
(20Ã¢Â€Â“150Â kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1Ã¢Â€Â“4Â kg per capita).
[184]
The primary and secondary lead production processes are similar. Some primary
production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and this
trend is likely to increase in the future. Given adequate techniques, lead
obtained via secondary processes is indistinguishable from lead obtained via
primary processes. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean
and is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes
needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy
requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.[185]
**** Primary[edit] ****
Most lead ores contain a low percentage of lead (rich ores have a typical
content of 3Ã¢Â€Â“8%) which must be concentrated for extraction.[186] During
initial processing, ores typically undergo crushing, dense-medium_separation,
grinding, froth_flotation, and drying. The resulting concentrate, which has a
lead content of 30Ã¢Â€Â“80% by mass (regularly 50Ã¢Â€Â“60%),[186] is then turned into
(impure) lead metal.
There are two main ways of doing this: a two-stage process involving roasting
followed by blast furnace extraction, carried out in separate vessels; or a
direct process in which the extraction of the concentrate occurs in a single
vessel. The latter has become the most common route, though the former is still
significant.[187]

*** Two-stage process[edit] ***
First, the sulfide concentrate is roasted in air to oxidize the lead sulfide:
[188]
      2Â PbS(s) + 3Â O2(g) Ã¢Â†Â’ 2Â PbO(s) + 2Â SO2(g)Ã¢Â†Â‘
As the original concentrate was not pure lead sulfide, roasting yields not only
the desired lead(II) oxide, but a mixture of oxides, sulfates, and silicates of
lead and of the other metals contained in the ore.[189] This impure lead oxide
is reduced in a coke-fired blast furnace to the (again, impure) metal:[190]
      2Â PbO(s) + C(s) Ã¢Â†Â’ 2Â Pb(s) + CO2(g)Ã¢Â†Â‘
Impurities are mostly arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and
gold. Typically they are removed in a series of pyrometallurgical_processes.
The melt is treated in a reverberatory_furnace with air, steam, and sulfur,
which oxidizes the impurities except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized
contaminants float to the top_of_the_melt and are skimmed off.[191][192]
Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the
Parkes_process, in which zinc is added to lead. Zinc, which is immiscible in
lead, dissolves the silver and gold. The zinc solution can be separated from
the lead, and the silver and gold retrieved.[192][193] De-silvered lead is
freed of bismuth by the BettertonÃ¢Â€Â“Kroll_process, treating it with metallic
calcium and magnesium. The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.[192]
Alternatively to the pyrometallurgical processes, very pure lead can be
obtained by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the Betts_process.
Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of
lead fluorosilicate (PbSiF6). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead
at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the
impurities in solution.[192][194] This is a high-cost process and thus mostly
reserved for refining bullion containing high percentages of impurities.[195]
*** Direct process[edit] ***
In this process, lead bullion and slag is obtained directly from lead
concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized,
forming lead monoxide. Carbon (as coke or coal_gas[o]) is added to the molten
charge along with fluxing_agents. The lead monoxide is thereby reduced to
metallic lead, in the midst of a slag rich in lead monoxide.[187]
If the input is rich in lead, as much as 80% of the original lead can be
obtained as bullion; the remaining 20% forms a slag rich in lead monoxide. For
a low-grade feed, all of the lead can be oxidized to a high-lead slag.[187]
Metallic lead is further obtained from the high-lead (25Ã¢Â€Â“40%) slags via
submerged fuel combustion or injection, reduction assisted by an electric
furnace, or a combination of both.[187]
*** Alternatives[edit] ***
Research on a cleaner, less energy-intensive lead extraction process continues;
a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste, or the
alternatives result in a high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal.
Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into
an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that
may have potential, but is not currently economical except in cases where
electricity is very cheap.[196]
**** Secondary[edit] ****
Smelting, which is an essential part of the primary production, is often
skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead
has undergone significant oxidation.[185] The process is similar to that of
primary production in either a blast_furnace or a rotary_furnace, with the
essential difference being the greater variability of yields: blast furnaces
produce hard lead (10% antimony) while reverberatory and rotary kiln furnaces
produced semisoft lead (3Ã¢Â€Â“4% antimony).[197] The Isasmelt_process is a more
recent smelting method that may act as an extension to primary production;
battery paste from spent leadÃ¢Â€Â“acid batteries (containing lead sulfate and
lead oxides) has its sulfate removed by treating it with alkali, and is then
treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure
lead, with antimony the most common impurity.[198] Refining of secondary lead
is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped
depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination.[198]
Of the sources of lead for recycling, leadÃ¢Â€Â“acid batteries are the most
important; lead pipe, sheet, and cable sheathing are also significant.[185]
***** Applications[edit] *****
[A_closed_structure_of_black_bricks]
Bricks of lead (alloyed with 4% antimony) are used as radiation shielding.[199]
Contrary to popular belief, pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made
from lead. When the pencil originated as a wrapped graphite writing tool, the
particular type of graphite used was named plumbago (literally, act for lead or
lead mockup).[200]
**** Elemental form[edit] ****
Lead metal has several useful mechanical properties, including high density,
low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness. Many metals are superior
to lead in some of these aspects but are generally less common and more
difficult to extract from parent ores. Lead's toxicity has led to its phasing
out for some uses.[201]
Lead has been used for bullets since their invention in the Middle Ages. It is
inexpensive; its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun
pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than
other common metals, which allows for better retention of velocity. It remains
the main material for bullets, alloyed with other metals as hardeners.[159]
Concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the
environment.[p]
Lead's high density and resistance to corrosion have been exploited in a number
of related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels; its density
allows it to take up a small volume and minimize water resistance, thus
counterbalancing the heeling effect of wind on the sails.[203] It is used in
scuba_diving weight_belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy.[204] In 1993, the
base of the Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead.[205]
Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for
underwater cables.[206]
[A_yellow_sculpture_in_a_park]
A 17th-century gold-coated lead sculpture
Lead has many uses in the construction industry; lead sheets are used as
architectural_metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and
gutter joints, and on roof parapets.[207][208] Lead is still used in statues
and sculptures,[q] including for armatures.[210] In the past it was often used
to balance_the_wheels_of_cars; for environmental reasons this use is being
phased out in favor of other materials.[110]
Lead is added to copper alloys, such as brass and bronze, to improve
machinability and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in
copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy,
such as grain_boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a
lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked,
thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of
lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper
provides the load-bearing support.[211]
Lead's high density, atomic number, and formability form the basis for use of
lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation.[212] Lead has
no natural resonance frequencies;[212] as a result, sheet-lead is used as a
sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios.[213]
Organ_pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin
to control the tone of each pipe.[214][215] Lead is an established shielding
material from radiation in nuclear_science and in X-ray rooms[216] due to its
denseness and high attenuation_coefficient.[217] Molten lead has been used as a
coolant for lead-cooled_fast_reactors.[218]
The largest use of lead in the early 21st century is in leadÃ¢Â€Â“acid batteries.
The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are
fewer toxicity concerns.[r] People who work in battery production plants may be
exposed to lead dust and inhale it.[220]} The reactions in the battery between
lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage.[s]
Supercapacitors incorporating leadÃ¢Â€Â“acid batteries have been installed in
kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United
States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing,
and other applications.[222] These batteries have lower energy density and
charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion_batteries, but are significantly
cheaper.[223]
[A_crystal_glass]
Lead_glass
Lead is used in high voltage power cables as sheathing material to prevent
water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being phased
out.[224] Its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some
countries to reduce the amount of environmentally_hazardous waste.[225] Lead is
one of three metals used in the Oddy_test for museum materials, helping detect
organic acids, aldehydes, and acidic gases.[226][227]
**** Compounds[edit] ****
In addition to being the main application for lead metal, lead-acid batteries
are also the main consumer of lead compounds. The energy storage/release
reaction used in these devices involves lead_sulfate and lead_dioxide:
      Pb(s) + PbO
      2(s) + 2H
      2SO
      4(aq) Ã¢Â†Â’ 2PbSO
      4(s) + 2H
      2O(l)
Other applications of lead compounds are very specialized and often fading.
Lead-based coloring agents are used in ceramic_glazes and glass, especially for
red and yellow shades.[228] While lead paints are phased out in Europe and
North America, they remain in use in less developed countries such as China,
[229] India,[230] or Indonesia.[231] Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are
used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the
polyvinyl_chloride coating of electrical cords.[232][233] It can be used to
treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity,
European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc.[234]
[235] Lead_glass is composed of 12Ã¢Â€Â“28% lead_oxide, changing its optical
characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation.[236] Lead-
based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in
photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.[237]

Lead has no confirmed biological role, and there is no confirmed safe level of
lead exposure.[239] A 2009 CanadianÃ¢Â€Â“American study concluded that even at
levels that are considered to pose little to no risk, lead may cause "adverse
mental health outcomes".[240] Its prevalence in the human bodyÃ¢Â€Â”at an adult
average of 120Â mg[t]Ã¢Â€Â”is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500Â mg) and iron
(4000Â mg) among the heavy metals.[242] Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed
by the body.[243] A small amount of lead (1%) is stored in bones; the rest is
excreted in urine and feces within a few weeks of exposure. Only about a third
of lead is excreted by a child. Continual exposure may result in the
bioaccumulation of lead.[244]
**** Toxicity[edit] ****
Lead is a highly poisonous metal (whether inhaled or swallowed), affecting
almost every organ and system in the human body.[245] At airborne levels of
100Â mg/m3, it is immediately_dangerous_to_life_and_health.[246] Most ingested
lead is absorbed into the bloodstream.[247] The primary cause of its toxicity
is its predilection for interfering with the proper functioning of enzymes. It
does so by binding to the sulfhydryl_groups found on many enzymes,[248] or
mimicking and displacing other metals which act as cofactors in many enzymatic
reactions.[249] Among the essential metals that lead interacts with are
calcium, iron, and zinc.[250] High levels of calcium and iron tend to provide
some protection from lead poisoning; low levels cause increased susceptibility.
[243]
**** Effects[edit] ****
Lead can cause severe damage to the brain and kidneys and, ultimately, death.
By mimicking calcium, lead can cross the bloodÃ¢Â€Â“brain_barrier. It degrades the
myelin sheaths of neurons, reduces their numbers, interferes with
neurotransmission routes, and decreases neuronal growth.[248] In the human
body, lead inhibits porphobilinogen_synthase and ferrochelatase, preventing
both porphobilinogen formation and the incorporation of iron into
protoporphyrin_IX, the final step in heme synthesis. This causes ineffective
heme synthesis and microcytic_anemia.[251]
[A_chart_of_a_human_body_with_arrows_pointing_pieces_of_text_to_different_parts
of_the_body]
Symptoms of lead poisoning
Symptoms of lead poisoning include nephropathy, colic-like abdominal pains, and
possibly weakness in the fingers, wrists, or ankles. Small blood pressure
increases, particularly in middle-aged and older people, may be apparent and
can cause anemia. Several studies, mostly cross-sectional, found an association
between increased lead exposure and decreased heart rate variability.[252] In
pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage. Chronic,
high-level exposure has been shown to reduce fertility in males.[253]
In a child's developing brain, lead interferes with synapse formation in the
cerebral_cortex, neurochemical development (including that of
neurotransmitters), and the organization of ion_channels.[254] Early childhood
exposure has been linked with an increased risk of sleep disturbances and
excessive daytime drowsiness in later childhood.[255] High blood levels are
associated with delayed puberty in girls.[256] The rise and fall in exposure to
airborne lead from the combustion of tetraethyl lead in gasoline during the
20th century has been linked with historical increases and decreases in crime
levels, a hypothesis which is not universally accepted.[257]
**** Exposure sources[edit] ****
Lead exposure is a global issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery
manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries. Lead enters the
body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is
absorbed into the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20Ã¢Â€Â“70%, with children
absorbing a higher percentage than adults.[258]
Poisoning typically results from ingestion of food or water contaminated with
lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust,
or lead-based paint.[259] Seawater products can contain lead if affected by
nearby industrial waters.[260] Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high
levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated
through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual
emissions from leaded gasoline.[261]
The use of lead for water pipes is a_problem_in_areas_with_soft_or_acidic
water.[262] Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and
acidic water dissolves the lead pipes.[263] Dissolved carbon_dioxide in the
carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate;
oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II)_hydroxide. Drinking
such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the
dissolved lead. The harder_the_water the more calcium_bicarbonate and sulfate
it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a
protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.[264]
Kymographic recording of the effect of lead acetate on frog heart experimental
set up.
Ingestion of applied lead-based paint is the major source of exposure for
children: a direct source is chewing on old painted window sills.
Alternatively, as the applied dry paint deteriorates, it peels, is pulverized
into dust and then enters the body through hand-to-mouth contact or
contaminated food, water, or alcohol. Ingesting certain home_remedies may
result in exposure to lead or its compounds.[265]
Inhalation is the second major exposure pathway, affecting smokers and
especially workers in lead-related occupations.[247] Cigarette_smoke contains,
among other toxic substances, radioactive lead-210.[266]
Skin exposure may be significant for people working with organic lead
compounds. The rate of skin absorption is lower for inorganic lead.[267]
**** Treatment[edit] ****
See also: Chelation_therapy
Treatment for lead poisoning normally involves the administration of
dimercaprol and succimer.[268] Acute cases may require the use of disodium
calcium_edetate, the calcium chelate, and the disodium salt of
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). It has a greater affinity for lead than
calcium, with the result that lead chelate is formed by exchange and excreted
in the urine, leaving behind harmless calcium.[269]
***** Environmental effects[edit] *****
[A_dusty_dump]
Battery collection site in Dakar, Senegal, where at least 18 children died of
lead poisoning in 2008
The extraction, production, use, and disposal of lead and its products have
caused significant contamination of the Earth's soils and waters. Atmospheric
emissions of lead were at their peak during the Industrial Revolution, and the
leaded gasoline period in the second half of the twentieth century. Lead
releases originate from natural sources (i.e., concentration of the naturally
occurring lead), industrial production, incineration and recycling, and
mobilization of previously buried lead.[270] Elevated concentrations of lead
persist in soils and sediments in post-industrial and urban areas; industrial
emissions, including those arising from coal burning,[271] continue in many
parts of the world, particularly in the developing countries.[272]
Lead can accumulate in soils, especially those with a high organic content,
where it remains for hundreds to thousands of years. Environmental lead can
compete with other metals found in and on plants surfaces potentially
inhibiting photosynthesis and at high enough concentrations, negatively
affecting plant growth and survival. Contamination of soils and plants can
allow lead to ascend the food chain affecting microorganisms and animals. In
animals, lead exhibits toxicity in many organs, damaging the nervous, renal,
reproductive, hematopoietic, and cardiovascular systems after ingestion,
inhalation, or skin absorption.[273] Fish uptake lead from both water and
sediment;[274] bioaccumulation in the food chain poses a hazard to fish, birds,
and sea mammals.[275]
Anthropogenic lead includes lead from shot and sinkers. These are among the
most potent sources of lead contamination along with lead production sites.
[276] Lead was banned for shot and sinkers in the United States in 2017,[277]
although that ban was only effective for a month,[278] and a similar ban is
being considered in the European Union.[279]
Analytical methods for the determination of lead in the environment include
spectrophotometry, X-ray_fluorescence, atomic_spectroscopy and electrochemical
methods. A specific ion-selective_electrode has been developed based on the
ionophore S,S'-methylenebis(N,N-diisobutyldithiocarbamate).[280] An important
biomarker assay for lead poisoning is ÃÂ´-aminolevulinic acid levels in plasma,
serum, and urine.[281]
***** Restriction and remediation[edit] *****
[An_X-ray_picture_with_numerous_small_pellets_highlighted_in_white]
Radiography of a swan found dead in CondÃƒÂ©-sur-l'Escaut (northern France),
highlighting lead shot. There are hundreds of lead pellets; a dozen is enough
to kill an adult swan within a few days. Such bodies are sources of
environmental contamination by lead.
By the mid-1980s, there was significant decline in the use of lead in industry.
In the United States, environmental regulations reduced or eliminated the use
of lead in non-battery products, including gasoline, paints, solders, and water
systems. Particulate control devices were installed in coal-fired_power_plants
to capture lead emissions.[271] In 1992, U.S. Congress required the
Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the blood lead levels of the
country's children.[282] Lead use was further curtailed by the European Union's
2003 Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive.[283] A large drop in lead
deposition occurred in the Netherlands after the 1993 national ban on use of
lead shot for hunting and sport shooting: from 230 tonnes in 1990 to 47.5
tonnes in 1995.[284]
In the United States, the permissible_exposure_limit for lead in the workplace,
comprising metallic lead, inorganic lead compounds, and lead soaps, was set at
50Â ÃÂ¼g/m3 over an 8-hour workday, and the blood_lead_level limit at 5Â ÃÂ¼g per
100Â g of blood in 2012.[285] Lead may still be found in harmful quantities in
stoneware,[286] vinyl[287] (such as that used for tubing and the insulation of
electrical cords), and Chinese brass.[u] Old houses may still contain lead
paint.[287] White lead paint has been withdrawn_from_sale in industrialized
countries, but specialized uses of other pigments such as yellow lead_chromate
remain.[172] Stripping old paint by sanding produces dust which can be inhaled.
[289] Lead_abatement programs have been mandated by some authorities in
properties where young children live.[290]
Lead waste, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the waste, may be
treated as household waste (in order to facilitate lead abatement activities),
[291] or potentially hazardous waste requiring specialized treatment or
storage.[292] Lead is released to the wildlife in shooting places and a number
of lead management practices, such as stewardship of the environment and
reduced public scrutiny, have been developed to counter the lead contamination.
[293] Lead migration can be enhanced in acidic soils; to counter that, it is
advised soils be treated with lime to neutralize the soils and prevent leaching
of lead.[294]
Research has been conducted on how to remove lead from biosystems by biological
means: Fish bones are being researched for their ability to bioremediate lead
in contaminated soil.[295][296] The fungus Aspergillus_versicolor is effective
at absorbing lead ions from industrial waste before being released to water
bodies.[297] Several bacteria have been researched for their ability to remove
lead from the environment, including the sulfate-reducing_bacteria
Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum, both of which are highly effective in
aqueous solutions.[298]

      the tetrahedra of gray tin along their cubic axes. White tin effectively
      has a structure intermediate between the regular tetrahedral structure of
      gray tin, and the regular face centered cubic structure of lead,
      consistent with the general trend of increasing metallic character going
      down any representative group.[10]
   3. ^ A quasicrystalline thin-film allotrope of lead, with pentagonal
      symmetry, was reported in 2013. The allotrope was obtained by depositing
      lead atoms on the surface of an icosahedral silver-indium-ytterbium
      quasicrystal. Its conductivity was not recorded.[11][12]
   4. ^ Diamond cubic structures with lattice parameters around the lattice
      parameter of silicon exists both in thin lead and tin films, and in
      massive lead and tin, freshly solidified in vacuum of ~5 x 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’6 Torr.
      Experimental evidence for almost identical structures of at least three
      oxide types is presented, demonstrating that lead and tin behave like
      silicon not only in the initial stages of crystallization, but also in
      the initial stages of oxidation.[13]
   5. ^ British_English: to go down like a lead balloon.
   6. ^ Malleability describes how easily it deforms under compression, whereas
      ductility means its ability to stretch.
   7. ^ A (wet) finger can be dipped into molten lead without risk of a burning
      injury.[26]
   8. ^ An even number of either protons or neutrons generally increases the
      nuclear stability of isotopes, compared to isotopes with odd numbers. No
      elements with odd atomic numbers have more than two stable isotopes;
      even-numbered elements have multiple stable isotopes, with tin (element
      50) having the highest number of isotopes of all elements, ten.[30] See
      Even_and_odd_atomic_nuclei for more details.
   9. ^ The half-life found in the experiment was 1.9ÃƒÂ—1019 years.[33] A
      kilogram of natural bismuth would have an activity value of approximately
      0.003 becquerels (decays per second). For comparison, the activity value
      of natural radiation in the human body is around 65 becquerels per
      kilogram of body weight (4500 becquerels on average).[34]
  10. ^ Lead-205 decays solely via electron_capture, which means when there are
      no electrons available and lead is fully ionized with all 82 electrons
      removed it cannot decay. Fully ionized thallium-205, the isotope lead-205
      would decay to, becomes unstable and can decay into a bound_state of
      lead-205.[45]
  11. ^ Abundances in the source are listed relative to silicon rather than in
      per-particle notation. The sum of all elements per 106 parts of silicon
      is 2.6682ÃƒÂ—1010 parts; lead comprises 3.258 parts.
  12. ^ Elemental abundance figures are estimates and their details may vary
      from source to source.[108]
  13. ^ The fact that Julius_Caesar fathered only one child, as well as the
      alleged sterility of his successor, Caesar_Augustus, have been attributed
      to lead poisoning.[139]
  14. ^ The inscription reads: "Made when the Emperor Vespasian was consul for
      the ninth term and the Emperor Titus was consul for the seventh term,
      when Gnaeus_Iulius_Agricola was imperial governor (of Britain)."
  15. ^ Gaseous by-product of the coking process, containing carbon_monoxide,
      hydrogen and methane; used as a fuel.
  16. ^ California began banning lead bullets for hunting on that basis in July
      2015.[202]
  17. ^ For example, a firm "...producing quality [lead] garden ornament from
      our studio in West London for over a century".[209]
  18. ^ Potential injuries to regular users of such batteries are not related
      to lead's toxicity.[219]
  19. ^ See[221] for details on how a leadÃ¢Â€Â“acid battery works.
  20. ^ Rates vary greatly by country.[241]
  21. ^ An alloy of brass (copper and zinc) with lead, iron, tin, and sometimes
      antimony.[288]
