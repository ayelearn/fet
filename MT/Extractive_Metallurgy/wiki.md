ore extraction process
Extractive metallurgy is a branch of metallurgical_engineering wherein process
and methods of extraction of metals from their natural mineral_deposits are
studied. The field is a materials_science, covering all aspects of the types of
ore, washing, concentration, separation, chemical processes and extraction of
pure metal and their alloying to suit various applications, sometimes for
direct use as a finished product, but more often in a form that requires
further working to achieve the given properties to suit the applications.[1]
The field of ferrous and non-ferrous_extractive_metallurgy have specialties
that are generically grouped into the categories of mineral_processing,
hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy based on the process
adopted to extract the metal. Several processes are used for extraction of same
metal depending on occurrence and chemical requirements.

***** Mineral processing[edit] *****
Mineral_processing begins with beneficiation, consisting of initially breaking
down the ore to required sizes depending on the concentration process to be
followed, by crushing, grinding, sieving etc. Thereafter, the ore is physically
separated from any unwanted impurity, depending on the form of occurrence and/
or further process involved. Separation processes take advantage of physical
properties of the materials. These physical properties can include density,
particle size and shape, electrical and magnetic properties, and surface
properties. Major physical and chemical methods include magnetic separation,
froth_flotation, leaching etc., whereby the impurities and unwanted materials
are removed from the ore and the base ore of the metal is concentrated, meaning
the percentage of metal in the ore is increased. This concentrate is then
either processed to remove moisture or else used as is for extraction of the
metal or made into shapes and forms that can undergo further processing, with
ease of handling.
Ore bodies often contain more than one valuable metal. Tailings of a previous
process may be used as a feed in another process to extract a secondary product
from the original ore. Additionally, a concentrate may contain more than one
valuable metal. That concentrate would then be processed to separate the
valuable metals into individual constituents.
***** Hydrometallurgy[edit] *****
Main article: Hydrometallurgy
Hydrometallurgy is concerned with processes involving aqueous solutions to
extract metals from ores. The first step in the hydrometallurgical process is
leaching, which involves dissolution of the valuable metals into the aqueous
solution and/or a suitable solvent. After the solution is separated from the
ore solids, the extract is often subjected to various processes of purification
and concentration before the valuable metal is recovered either in its metallic
state or as a chemical compound. This may include precipitation, distillation,
adsorption, and solvent_extraction. The final recovery step may involve
precipitation, cementation, or an electrometallurgical process. Sometimes,
hydrometallurgical processes may be carried out directly on the ore material
without any pretreatment steps. More often, the ore must be pretreated by
various mineral processing steps, and sometimes by pyrometallurgical processes.

***** Pyrometallurgy[edit] *****
Main article: Pyrometallurgy
Ellingham diagram for high temperature oxidation
Pyrometallurgy involves high temperature processes where chemical reactions
take place among gases, solids, and molten materials. Solids containing
valuable metals are treated to form intermediate compounds for further
processing or converted into their elemental or metallic state.
Pyrometallurgical processes that involve gases and solids are typified by
calcining and roasting operations. Processes that produce molten products are
collectively referred to as smelting operations. The energy required to sustain
the high temperature pyrometallurgical processes may derive from the exothermic
nature of the chemical reactions taking place. Typically, these reactions are
oxidation, e.g. of sulfide to sulfur_dioxide . Often, however, energy must be
added to the process by combustion of fuel or, in the case of some smelting
processes, by the direct application of electrical energy.
Ellingham_Diagrams are a useful way of analysing the possible reactions, and so
predicting their outcome.
***** Electrometallurgy[edit] *****
Main article: Electrometallurgy
Electrometallurgy involves metallurgical processes that take place in some form
of electrolytic_cell. The most common types of electrometallurgical processes
are electrowinning and electro-refining. Electrowinning is an electrolysis
process used to recover metals in aqueous solution, usually as the result of an
ore having undergone one or more hydrometallurgical processes. The metal of
interest is plated onto the cathode, while the anode is an inert electrical
conductor. Electro-refining is used to dissolve an impure metallic anode
(typically from a smelting process) and produce a high purity cathode. Fused
salt electrolysis is another electrometallurgical process whereby the valuable
metal has been dissolved into a molten salt which acts as the electrolyte, and
the valuable metal collects on the cathode of the cell. The fused salt
electrolysis process is conducted at temperatures sufficient to keep both the
electrolyte and the metal being produced in the molten state. The scope of
electrometallurgy has significant overlap with the areas of hydrometallurgy and
(in the case of fused salt electrolysis) pyrometallurgy. Additionally,
electrochemical phenomena play a considerable role in many mineral processing
and hydrometallurgical processes.
