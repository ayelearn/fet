Aggression is overt or covert, often harmful, social interaction with the
intention of inflicting damage or other unpleasantness upon another individual.
It may occur either reactively or without provocation. In humans, frustration
due to blocked goals can cause aggression. Human aggression can be classified
into direct and indirect aggression; whilst the former is characterized by
physical or verbal behavior intended to cause harm to someone, the latter is
characterized by behavior intended to harm the social relations of an
individual or group.[1][2]
In definitions commonly used in the social_sciences and behavioral_sciences,
aggression is an action or response by an individual that delivers something
unpleasant to another person.[3] Some definitions include that the individual
must intend to harm another person.[4] Predatory or defensive behavior between
members of different species may not be considered aggression in the same
sense.
Aggression can take a variety of forms, which may be expressed physically, or
communicated verbally or non-verbally: including anti-predator aggression,
defensive aggression (fear-induced), predatory aggression, dominance
aggression, inter-male aggression, resident-intruder aggression, maternal
aggression, species-specific aggression, sex-related aggression, territorial
aggression, isolation-induced aggression, irritable aggression, and brain-
stimulation-induced aggression (hypothalamus). There are two subtypes of human
aggression: (1) controlled-instrumental subtype (purposeful or goal-oriented);
and (2) reactive-impulsive subtype (often elicits uncontrollable actions that
are inappropriate or undesirable). Aggression differs from what is commonly
called assertiveness, although the terms are often used interchangeably among
laypeople (as in phrases such as "an aggressive salesperson").[5]

***** Overview[edit] *****
Aggression can have adaptive benefits or negative effects. Aggressive behavior
is an individual or collective social interaction that is a hostile behavior
with the intention of inflicting damage or harm.[1][2] Two broad categories of
aggression are commonly distinguished. One includes affective (emotional) and
hostile, reactive, or retaliatory aggression that is a response to provocation,
and the other includes instrumental, goal-oriented or predatory, in which
aggression is used as a mean to achieve a goal.[6] An example of hostile
aggression would be a person who punches someone who insulted him or her. An
instrumental form of aggression would be armed_robbery. Research on violence
from a range of disciplines lend some support to a distinction between
affective and predatory aggression.[7] However, some researchers question the
usefulness of a hostile versus instrumental distinction in humans, despite its
ubiquity in research, because most real-life cases involve mixed motives and
interacting causes.[8]
A number of classifications and dimensions of aggression have been suggested.
These depend on such things as whether the aggression is verbal or physical;
whether or not it involves relational_aggression such as covert bullying and
social manipulation;[9] whether harm to others is intended or not; whether it
is carried out actively or expressed passively; and whether the aggression is
aimed directly or indirectly. Classification may also encompass aggression-
related emotions (e.g. anger) and mental states (e.g. impulsivity, hostility).
[10] Aggression may occur in response to non-social as well as social factors,
and can have a close relationship with stress coping style.[11] Aggression may
be displayed in order to intimidate.
The operative definition of aggression may be affected by moral or political
views. Examples are the axiomatic moral view called the non-aggression
principle and the political rules governing the behavior of one country toward
another.[12] Likewise in competitive sports, or in the workplace, some forms of
aggression may be sanctioned and others not (see Workplace_aggression).[13]
Aggressive behaviors are associated with adjustment problems and several
psychopathological symptoms such as Antisocial_Personality_Disorder, Borderline
Personality_Disorder, and Intermittent_Explosive_Disorder.[14]
Biological approaches conceptualize aggression as an internal energy released
by external stimuli, a product of evolution through natural selection, part of
genetics, a product of hormonal fluctuations. Psychological approaches
conceptualize aggression as a destructive instinct, a response to frustration,
an affect excited by a negative stimulus, a result of observed learning of
society and diversified reinforcement, a resultant of variables that affect
personal and situational environments.[15][16]
***** Etymology[edit] *****
The term aggression comes from the Latin word aggressio, meaning attack. The
Latin was itself a joining of ad- and gradi-, which meant step at. The first
known use dates back to 1611, in the sense of an unprovoked attack.[17] A
psychological sense of "hostile or destructive behavior" dates back to a 1912
English translation of Sigmund_Freud's writing.[18] Alfred_Adler theorized
about an "aggressive drive" in 1908. Child_raising experts began to refer to
aggression, rather than anger, from the 1930s.[19]
***** Ethology[edit] *****

Ethologists study aggression as it relates to the interaction and evolution of
animals in natural settings. In such settings aggression can involve bodily
contact such as biting, hitting or pushing, but most conflicts are settled by
threat displays and intimidating thrusts that cause no physical harm. This form
of aggression may include the display of body size, antlers, claws or teeth;
stereotyped signals including facial expressions; vocalizations such as bird
song; the release of chemicals; and changes in coloration.[20] The term
agonistic_behaviour is sometimes used to refer to these forms of behavior.
Most ethologists believe that aggression confers biological advantages.
Aggression may help an animal secure territory, including resources such as
food and water. Aggression between males often occurs to secure mating
opportunities, and results in selection of the healthier/more vigorous animal.
Aggression may also occur for self-protection or to protect offspring.[21]
Aggression between groups of animals may also confer advantage; for example,
hostile behavior may force a population of animals into a new territory, where
the need to adapt to a new environment may lead to an increase in genetic
flexibility.[22]
**** Between species and groups[edit] ****
The most apparent type of interspecific aggression is that observed in the
interaction between a predator and its prey. However, according to many
researchers, predation is not aggression. A cat does not hiss or arch its back
when pursuing a rat, and the active areas in its hypothalamus resemble those
that reflect hunger rather than those that reflect aggression.[23] However,
others refer to this behavior as predatory aggression, and point out cases that
resemble hostile behavior, such as mouse-killing by rats.[24] In aggressive
mimicry a predator has the appearance of a harmless organism or object
attractive to the prey; when the prey approaches, the predator attacks.
An animal defending against a predator may engage in either "fight_or_flight"
or "tend_and_befriend" in response to predator attack or threat of attack,
depending on its estimate of the predator's strength relative to its own.
Alternative defenses include a range of antipredator_adaptations, including
alarm_signals. An example of an alarm signal is nerol, a chemical which is
found in the mandibular glands of Trigona_fulviventris individuals.[25] Release
of nerol by T. fulviventris individuals in the nest has been shown to decrease
the number of individuals leaving the nest by fifty percent, as well as
increasing aggressive behaviors like biting.[25] Alarm signals like nerol can
also act as attraction signals; in T. fulviventris, individuals that have been
captured by a predator may release nerol to attract nestmates, who will proceed
to attack or bite the predator.[25]
Aggression between groups is determined partly by willingness to fight, which
depends on a number of factors including numerical advantage, distance from
home territories, how often the groups encounter each other, competitive
abilities, differences in body size, and whose territory is being invaded.[26]
Also, an individual is more likely to become aggressive if other aggressive
group members are nearby.[27] One particular phenomenon¬†√¢¬Ä¬ì the formation of
coordinated coalitions that raid neighbouring territories to kill
conspecifics¬†√¢¬Ä¬ì has only been documented in two species in the animal kingdom:
'common'_chimpanzees and humans.[28]
**** Within a group[edit] ****
Aggression between conspecifics in a group typically involves access to
resources and breeding opportunities. One of its most common functions is to
establish a dominance_hierarchy. This occurs in many species by aggressive
encounters between contending males when they are first together in a common
environment.[29] Usually the more aggressive animals become the more dominant.
[30][31] In test situations, most of the conspecific aggression ceases about 24
hours after the group of animals is brought together.[29][32] Aggression has
been defined from this viewpoint as "behavior which is intended to increase the
social dominance of the organism relative to the dominance position of other
organisms".[33] Losing confrontations may be called social_defeat, and winning
or losing is associated with a range of practical and psychological
consequences.[34]
Conflicts between animals occur in many contexts, such as between potential
mating partners, between parents and offspring, between siblings and between
competitors for resources. Group-living animals may dispute over the direction
of travel or the allocation of time to joint activities. Various factors limit
the escalation of aggression, including communicative displays, conventions,
and routines. In addition, following aggressive incidents, various forms of
conflict_resolution have been observed in mammalian species, particularly in
gregarious primates. These can mitigate or repair possible adverse
consequences, especially for the recipient of aggression who may become
vulnerable to attacks by other members of a group. Conciliatory acts vary by
species and may involve specific gestures or simply more proximity and
interaction between the individuals involved. However, conflicts over food are
rarely followed by post conflict reunions, even though they are the most
frequent type in foraging primates.[35]
Other questions that have been considered in the study of primate aggression,
including in humans, is how aggression affects the organization of a group,
what costs are incurred by aggression, and why some primates avoid aggressive
behavior.[36] For example, bonobo_chimpanzee groups are known for low levels of
aggression within a partially matriarchal society. Captive animals including
primates may show abnormal levels of social aggression and self-harm that are
related to aspects of the physical or social environment; this depends on the
species and individual factors such as gender, age and background (e.g. raised
wild or captive).[37]
***** Evolutionary explanations[edit] *****
Like many behaviors, aggression can be examined in terms of its ability to help
an animal itself survive and reproduce, or alternatively to risk survival and
reproduction. This cost-benefit_analysis can be looked at in terms of
evolution. However, there are profound differences in the extent of acceptance
of a biological or evolutionary basis for human aggression.[38]
According to the male_warrior_hypothesis, intergroup aggression represents an
opportunity for men to gain access to mates, territory, resources and increased
status. As such, conflicts may have created selection evolutionary pressures
for psychological mechanisms in men to initiate intergroup aggression.[39][40]
**** Violence and conflict[edit] ****
Aggression can involve violence that may be adaptive under certain
circumstances in terms of natural_selection. This is most obviously the case in
terms of attacking prey to obtain food, or in anti-predatory defense. It may
also be the case in competition between members of the same species or
subgroup, if the average reward (e.g. status, access to resources, protection
of self or kin) outweighs average costs (e.g. injury, exclusion from the group,
death). There are some hypotheses of specific adaptions for violence in humans
under certain circumstances, including for homicide, but it is often unclear
what behaviors may have been selected for and what may have been a byproduct,
as in the case of collective violence.[41][42][43][44]
Although aggressive encounters are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, with often
high stakes, most encounters that involve aggression may be resolved through
posturing, or displaying and trial of strength. Game_theory is used to
understand how such behaviors might spread by natural_selection within a
population, and potentially become 'Evolutionary Stable Strategies'. An initial
model of resolution of conflicts is the hawk-dove_game. Others include the
Sequential_assessment_model and the Energetic_war_of_attrition. These try to
understand not just one-off encounters but protracted stand-offs, and mainly
differ in the criteria by which an individual decides to give up rather than
risk loss and harm in physical conflict (such as through estimates of resource
holding_potential).[45]
**** Gender[edit] ****
Gender plays an important role in human aggression.[46] There are multiple
theories that seek to explain findings that males and females of the same
species can have differing aggressive behaviors. However, the conditions under
which women and men differ in aggressiveness are not well understood or
studied.[47]
In general, sexual_dimorphism can be attributed to greater intraspecific
competition in one sex, either between rivals for access to mates and/or to be
chosen_by_mates.[48][49] This may stem from the other gender being constrained
by providing greater parental_investment, in terms of factors such as gamete
production, gestation, lactation, or upbringing of young. Although there is
much variation in species, generally the more physically aggressive sex is the
male, particularly in mammals.[50] In species where parental care by both sexes
is required, there tends to be less of a difference. When the female can leave
the male to care for the offspring, then females may be the larger and more
physically aggressive. Competitiveness despite parental investment has also
been observed in some species.[51] A related factor is the rate at which males
and females are able to mate again after producing offspring, and the basic
principles of sexual_selection are also influenced by ecological factors
affecting the ways or extent to which one sex can compete for the other. The
role of such factors in human evolution is controversial.
The pattern of male and female aggression is argued to be consistent with
evolved sexually-selected behavioral differences,[48] while alternative or
complimentary views emphasize conventional social_roles stemming from physical
evolved differences.[52] Aggression in women may have evolved to be, on
average, less physically dangerous and more covert or indirect.[53][54]
However, there are critiques for using animal behavior to explain human
behavior. Especially in the application of evolutionary explanations to
contemporary human behavior, including differences between the genders.[55]
According to the 2015 International_Encyclopedia_of_the_Social_&_Behavioral
Sciences, sex differences in aggression is one of the most robust and oldest
findings in psychology.[56] Past meta-analyses in the encyclopedia found males
regardless of age engaged in more physical and verbal aggression while small
effect for females engaging in more indirect aggression such as rumor spreading
or gossiping.[56] It also found males tend to engage in more unprovoked
aggression at higher frequency than females.[56] This analysis also conforms
with the Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology which reviewed past
analysis which found men to use more verbal and physical aggression with the
difference being greater in the physical type.[57] There are more recent
findings that show that differences in male and female aggression appear at
about two years of age, though the differences in aggression are more
consistent in middle-aged children and adolescence. Tremblay, Japel and
P√É¬©russe (1999) asserted that physically aggressive behaviors such as kicking,
biting and hitting are age-typical expressions of innate and spontaneous
reactions to biological drives such as anger, hunger, and affiliation.[58]
Girls' relational aggression, meaning non-physical or indirect, tends to
increase after age two while physical aggression decreases. There was no
significant difference in aggression between males and females before two years
of age.[59] A possible explanation for this could be that girls develop
language skills more quickly than boys, and therefore have better ways of
verbalizing their wants and needs. They are more likely to use communication
when trying to retrieve a toy with the words "Ask nicely" or "Say please."[60]
According to the journal of Aggressive Behaviour, an analysis across 9
countries found boys reported more in the use of physical aggression.[59] At
the same time no consistent sex differences emerged within relational
aggression.[59] It has been found that girls are more likely than boys to use
reactive aggression and then retract, but boys are more likely to increase
rather than to retract their aggression after their first reaction. Studies
show girls' aggressive tactics included gossip, ostracism, breaking
confidences, and criticism of a victim's clothing, appearance, or personality,
whereas boys engage in aggression that involves a direct physical and/or verbal
assault.[61] This could be due to the fact that girls' frontal lobes develop
earlier than boys, allowing them to self-restrain.[60]
One factor that shows insignificant differences between male and female
aggression is in sports. In sports, the rate of aggression in both contact and
non-contact sports is relatively equal. Since the establishment of Title IX,
female sports have increased in competitiveness and importance, which could
contribute to the evening of aggression and the "need to win" attitude between
both genders. Among sex differences found in adult sports were that females
have a higher scale of indirect hostility while men have a higher scale of
assault.[62] Another difference found is that men have up to 20 times higher
levels of testosterone than women.
Some studies suggest that romantic involvement in adolescence decreases
aggression in males and females, but decreases at a higher rate in females.
Females will seem more desirable to their mate if they fit in with society and
females that are aggressive do not usually fit well in society, they can often
be viewed as antisocial. Female aggression is not considered the norm in
society and going against the norm can sometimes prevent one from getting a
mate.[63] However, studies have shown that an increasing number of women are
getting arrested for domestic violence charges. In many states, women now
account for a quarter to a third of all domestic violence arrests, up from less
than 10 percent a decade ago. The new statistics reflect a reality documented
in research: women are perpetrators as well as victims of family violence.[64]
However, another equally possible explanation is a case of improved
diagnostics: it has become more acceptable for men to report female domestic
violence to the authorities while at the same time actual female domestic
violence has not increased at all. This can be the case when men have become
less ashamed of reporting female violence against them, therefore an increasing
number of women are arrested, although the actual number of violent women
remains the same.
In addition, males in competitive sports are often advised by their coaches not
to be in intimate relationships based on the premises that they become more
docile and less aggressive during an athletic event. The circumstances in which
males and females experience aggression are also different. A study showed that
social anxiety and stress was positively correlated with aggression in males,
meaning as stress and social anxiety increases so does aggression. Furthermore,
a male with higher social skills has a lower rate of aggressive behavior than a
male with lower social skills. In females, higher rates of aggression were only
correlated with higher rates of stress. Other than biological factors that
contribute to aggression there are physical factors are well.[65]
Regarding sexual dimorphism, humans fall into an intermediate group with
moderate sex differences in body size but relatively large testes. This is a
typical pattern of primates where several males and females live together in a
group and the male faces an intermediate number of challenges from other males
compared to exclusive polygyny and monogamy but frequent sperm_competition.[66]
Evolutionary_psychology and sociobiology have also discussed and produced
theories for some specific forms of male aggression such as sociobiological
theories_of_rape and theories regarding the Cinderella_effect. Another
evolutionary theory explaining gender differences in aggression is the Male
Warrior_hypothesis, which explains that males have psychologically evolved for
intergroup aggression in order to gain access to mates, resources, territory
and status.[39][40]
***** Physiology[edit] *****
**** Brain pathways[edit] ****
Many researchers focus on the brain to explain aggression. Numerous circuits
within both neocortical and subcortical structures play a central role in
controlling aggressive behavior, depending on the species, and the exact role
of pathways may vary depending on the type of trigger or intention.[67][2]
In mammals, the hypothalamus and periaqueductal_gray of the midbrain are
critical areas, as shown in studies on cats, rats, and monkeys. These brain
areas control the expression of both behavioral and autonomic components of
aggression in these species, including vocalization. Electrical stimulation of
the hypothalamus causes aggressive behavior[68] and the hypothalamus has
receptors that help determine aggression levels based on their interactions
with serotonin and vasopressin.[69] In rodents, activation of estrogen
receptor-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral portion of the ventromedial
hypothalamus (VMHvl) was found to be sufficient to initiate aggression in both
males and females.[70][71] Midbrain areas involved in aggression have direct
connections with both the brainstem nuclei controlling these functions, and
with structures such as the amygdala and prefrontal_cortex.
Stimulation of the amygdala results in augmented aggressive behavior in
hamsters,[72][73] while lesions of an evolutionarily_homologous area in the
lizard greatly reduce competitive drive and aggression (Bauman et al. 2006).
[74] In rhesus_monkeys, neonatal lesions in the amygdala or hippocampus results
in reduced expression of social dominance, related to the regulation of
aggression and fear.[75] Several experiments in attack-primed Syrian golden
hamsters, for example, support the claim of circuity within the amygdala being
involved in control of aggression.[73] The role of the amygdala is less clear
in primates and appears to depend more on situational context, with lesions
leading to increases in either social affiliatory or aggressive responses.
The broad area of the cortex known as the prefrontal_cortex (PFC) is crucial
for self-control and inhibition of impulses, including inhibition of aggression
and emotions. Reduced activity of the prefrontal cortex, in particular its
medial and orbitofrontal portions, has been associated with violent/antisocial
aggression.[76] In addition, reduced response_inhibition has been found in
violent offenders, compared to non-violent offenders.[67]
The role of the chemicals in the brain, particularly neurotransmitters, in
aggression has also been examined. This varies depending on the pathway, the
context and other factors such as gender. A deficit in serotonin has been
theorized to have a primary role in causing impulsivity and aggression. At
least one epigenetic study supports this supposition.[77] Nevertheless, low
levels of serotonin transmission may explain a vulnerability to impulsiveness,
potential aggression, and may have an effect through interactions with other
neurochemical systems. These include dopamine systems which are generally
associated with attention and motivation toward rewards, and operate at various
levels. Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, may influence aggression
responses both directly and indirectly through the hormonal system, the
sympathetic_nervous_system or the central_nervous_system (including the brain).
It appears to have different effects depending on the type of triggering
stimulus, for example social isolation/rank versus shock/chemical agitation
which appears not to have a linear relationship with aggression. Similarly,
GABA, although associated with inhibitory functions at many CNS synapses,
sometimes shows a positive correlation with aggression, including when
potentiated by alcohol.[78][79]
The hormonal neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin play a key role in complex
social behaviours in many mammals such as regulating attachment, social
recognition, and aggression. Vasopressin has been implicated in male-typical
social behaviors which includes aggression. Oxytocin may have a particular role
in regulating female bonds with offspring and mates, including the use of
protective aggression. Initial studies in humans suggest some similar effects.
[80][81]
In human, aggressive_behavior has been associated with abnormalities in three
principal regulatory systems in the body serotonin_systems, catecholamine
systems, and the hypothalamic√¢¬Ä¬ìpituitary√¢¬Ä¬ìadrenal_axis. Abnormalities in
these systems also are known to be induced by stress, either severe, acute
stress or chronic low-grade stress[82]
**** Testosterone[edit] ****
See also: Testosterone_√Ç¬ß¬†Aggression
Early androgenization has an organizational effect on the developing brains of
both males and females, making more neural circuits that control sexual
behavior as well as intermale and interfemale aggression become more sensitive
to testosterone.[83] Thus, aggressive behavior tends to increase with
testosterone. There are noticeable sex differences in aggression. Testosterone
is present to a lesser extent in females, who may be more sensitive to its
effects. Animal studies have also indicated a link between incidents of
aggression and the individual level of circulating testosterone. However,
results in relation to primates, particularly humans, are less clear cut and
are at best only suggestive of a positive association in some contexts.[84]
In humans, there is a seasonal variation in aggression associated with changes
in testosterone.[85] For example, in some primate species, such as rhesus
monkeys and baboons, females are more likely to engage in fights around the
time of ovulation as well as right before menstruation.[83] If the results were
the same in humans as they are in rhesus monkeys and baboons, then the increase
in aggressive behaviors during ovulation is explained by the decline in
estrogen levels. This makes normal testosterone levels more effective.[86]
Castrated mice and rats exhibit lower levels of aggression. Males castrated as
neonates exhibit low levels of aggression even when given testosterone
throughout their development.
*** Challenge hypothesis[edit] ***
The challenge_hypothesis outlines the dynamic relationship between plasma
testosterone levels and aggression in mating contexts in many species. It
proposes that testosterone is linked to aggression when it is beneficial for
reproduction, such as in mate guarding and preventing the encroachment of
intrasexual rivals. The challenge hypothesis predicts that seasonal patterns in
testosterone levels in a species are a function of mating system (monogamy
versus polygyny), paternal care, and male-male aggression in seasonal_breeders.
This pattern between testosterone and aggression was first observed in
seasonally breeding birds, such as the song_sparrow, where testosterone levels
rise modestly with the onset of the breeding season to support basic
reproductive functions.[87] The hypothesis has been subsequently expanded and
modified to predict relationships between testosterone and aggression in other
species. For example, chimpanzees, which are continuous breeders, show
significantly raised testosterone levels and aggressive male-male interactions
when receptive and fertile females are present.[88] Currently, no research has
specified a relationship between the modified challenge hypothesis and human
behavior, or the human nature of concealed_ovulation, although some suggest it
may apply.[85]
*** Effects on the nervous system[edit] ***
Testosterone to Estradiol conversion
Another line of research has focused on the proximate effects of circulating
testosterone on the nervous system, as mediated by local metabolism within the
brain. Testosterone can be metabolized to estradiol by the enzyme aromatase, or
to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5√é¬±-reductase.[89]
Aromatase is highly expressed in regions involved in the regulation of
aggressive behavior, such as the amygdala and hypothalamus. In studies using
genetic knockout techniques in inbred mice, male mice that lacked a functional
aromatase enzyme displayed a marked reduction in aggression. Long-term
treatment with estradiol partially restored aggressive behavior, suggesting
that the neural conversion of circulating testosterone to estradiol and its
effect on estrogen_receptors influences inter-male aggression. In addition, two
different estrogen receptors, ER√é¬± and ER√é¬≤, have been identified as having the
ability to exert different effects on aggression in mice. However, the effect
of estradiol appears to vary depending on the strain of mouse, and in some
strains it reduces aggression during long days (16 h of light), while during
short days (8 h of light) estradiol rapidly increases aggression.[89]
Another hypothesis is that testosterone influences brain areas that control
behavioral reactions. Studies in animal models indicate that aggression is
affected by several interconnected cortical and subcortical structures within
the so-called social_behavior network. A study involving lesions and
electrical-chemical stimulation in rodents and cats revealed that such a neural
network consists of the medial amygdala, medial hypothalamus and periaqueductal
grey (PAG), and it positively modulates reactive aggression.[90] Moreover, a
study done in human subjects showed that prefrontal-amygdala connectivity is
modulated by endogenous testosterone during social emotional behavior.[91]
In human studies, testosterone-aggression research has also focused on the role
of the orbitofrontal_cortex (OFC). This brain area is strongly associated with
impulse control and self-regulation systems that integrate emotion, motivation,
and cognition to guide context-appropriate behavior.[92] Patients with
localized lesions to the OFC engage in heightened reactive aggression.[93]
Aggressive behavior may be regulated by testosterone via reduced medial OFC
engagement following social provocation.[92] When measuring participants'
salivary testosterone, higher levels can predict subsequent aggressive
behavioral reactions to unfairness faced during a task. Moreover, brain
scanning with fMRI shows reduced activity in the medial OFC during such
reactions. Such findings may suggest that a specific brain region, the OFC, is
a key factor in understanding reactive aggression.
*** General associations with behavior[edit] ***
Scientists have for a long time been interested in the relationship between
testosterone and aggressive behavior. In most species, males are more
aggressive than females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on
aggressive behavior in males. In humans, males engage in crime and especially
violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the
early teens to mid teens which happen at the same time as testosterone levels
rise. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is
difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by a
lumbar_puncture which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have
often instead used more unreliable measurements from blood or saliva.[94]
The Handbook of Crime Correlates, a review of crime studies, states most
studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone although the
relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. However, nearly all
studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most
studies have also found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or
personality traits linked with criminality such as antisocial_behavior and
alcoholism. Many studies have also been done on the relationship between more
general aggressive behavior/feelings and testosterone. About half the studies
have found a relationship and about half no relationship.[94]
Studies of testosterone levels of male athletes before and after a competition
revealed that testosterone levels rise shortly before their matches, as if in
anticipation of the competition, and are dependent on the outcome of the event:
testosterone levels of winners are high relative to those of losers. No
specific response of testosterone levels to competition was observed in female
athletes, although a mood difference was noted.[95] In addition, some
experiments have failed to find a relationship between testosterone levels and
aggression in humans.[96][14][97]
The possible correlation between testosterone and aggression could explain the
"roid rage" that can result from anabolic_steroid use,[98][99] although an
effect of abnormally high levels of steroids does not prove an effect at
physiological levels.
**** Dehydroepiandrosterone[edit] ****
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is the most abundant circulating androgen hormone
and can be rapidly metabolized within target tissues into potent androgens and
estrogens. Gonadal steroids generally regulate aggression during the breeding
season, but non-gonadal steroids may regulate aggression during the non-
breeding season. Castration of various species in the non-breeding season has
no effect on territorial aggression. In several avian studies, circulating DHEA
has been found to be elevated in birds during the non-breeding season. These
data support the idea that non-breeding birds combine adrenal and/or gonadal
DHEA synthesis with neural DHEA metabolism to maintain territorial behavior
when gonadal testosterone secretion is low. Similar results have been found in
studies involving different strains of rats, mice, and hamsters. DHEA levels
also have been studied in humans and may play a role in human aggression.
Circulating DHEAS (its sulfated ester) levels rise during adrenarche (√¢¬â¬à7
years of age) while plasma testosterone levels are relatively low. This implies
that aggression in pre-pubertal children with aggressive conduct disorder might
be correlated with plasma DHEAS rather than plasma testosterone, suggesting an
important link between DHEAS and human aggressive behavior.[89]
**** Glucocorticoids[edit] ****
Glucocorticoid hormones have an important role in regulating aggressive
behavior. In adult rats, acute injections of corticosterone promote aggressive
behavior and acute reduction of corticosterone decreases aggression; however, a
chronic reduction of corticosterone levels can produce abnormally aggressive
behavior. In addition, glucocorticoids affect development of aggression and
establishment of social hierarchies. Adult mice with low baseline levels of
corticosterone are more likely to become dominant than are mice with high
baseline corticosterone levels.[89]
Glucocorticoids are released by the hypothalamic_pituitary_adrenal (HPA) axis
in response to stress, of which cortisol is the most prominent in humans.
Results in adults suggest that reduced levels of cortisol, linked to lower fear
or a reduced stress response, can be associated with more aggression. However,
it may be that proactive aggression is associated with low cortisol levels
while reactive aggression may be accompanied by elevated levels. Differences in
assessments of cortisol may also explain a diversity of results, particularly
in children.[84]
The HPA axis is related to the general fight-or-flight_response or acute_stress
reaction, and the role of catecholamines such as epinephrine, popularly known
as adrenaline.
**** Pheromones[edit] ****
In many animals, aggression can be linked to pheromones released between
conspecifics. In mice, major_urinary_proteins (Mups) have been demonstrated to
promote innate aggressive behavior in males,[100][101] and can be mediated by
neuromodulatory systems.[102] Mups activate olfactory_sensory_neurons in the
vomeronasal_organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via
specific sensory_receptors, of mice[101] and rats.[103] Pheremones have also
been identified in fruit_flies, detected by neurons in the antenna, that send a
message to the brain eliciting aggression; it has been noted that aggression
pheremones have not been identified in humans.[104]
***** Genetics[edit] *****
Main article: Genetics_of_aggression
In general, differences in a continuous phenotype such as aggression are likely
to result from the action of a large number of genes each of small effect,
which interact with each other and the environment through development and
life.
In a non-mammalian example of genes related to aggression, the fruitless gene
in fruit_flies is a critical determinant of certain sexually dimorphic
behaviors, and its artificial alteration can result in a reversal of
stereotypically male and female patterns of aggression in fighting. However, in
what was thought to be a relatively clear case, inherent complexities have been
reported in deciphering the connections between interacting genes in an
environmental context and a social phenotype involving multiple behavioral and
sensory interactions with another organism.[105]
In mice, candidate genes for differentiating aggression between the sexes are
the Sry (sex determining region Y) gene, located on the Y chromosome and the
Sts (steroid sulfatase) gene. The Sts gene encodes the steroid sulfatase
enzyme, which is pivotal in the regulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis. It is
expressed in both sexes, is correlated with levels of aggression among male
mice, and increases dramatically in females after parturition and during
lactation, corresponding to the onset of maternal aggression.[73] At least one
study has found a possible epigenetic signature (i.e. decreased methylation at
a specific CpG site on the promoter region) of the serotonin receptor 5-HT3a
that is associated with maternal aggression among human subjects.[77]
Mice with experimentally elevated sensitivity to oxidative_stress (through
inhibition of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, SOD1 activity) were tested for
aggressive behavior.[106] Males completely deficient in SOD1 were found to be
more aggressive than both wild-type males and males that express 50% of this
antioxidant enzyme. They were also faster to attack another male. The causal
connection between SOD1 deficiency and increased aggression is not yet
understood.
In humans, there is good evidence that the basic human neural architecture
underpinning the potential for flexible aggressive responses is influenced by
genes as well as environment. In terms of variation between individual people,
more than 100 twin_and_adoption_studies have been conducted in recent decades
examining the genetic basis of aggressive behavior and related constructs such
as conduct disorders. According to a meta-analysis published in 2002,
approximately 40% of variation between individuals is explained by differences
in genes, and 60% by differences in environment (mainly non-shared
environmental influences rather than those that would be shared by being raised
together). However, such studies have depended on self-report or observation by
others including parents, which complicates interpretation of the results. The
few laboratory-based analyses have not found significant amounts of individual
variation in aggression explicable by genetic variation in the human
population. Furthermore, linkage and association studies that seek to identify
specific genes, for example that influence neurotransmitter or hormone levels,
have generally resulted in contradictory findings characterized by failed
attempts at replication. One possible factor is an allele (variant) of the MAO-
A_gene which, in interaction with certain life events such as childhood
maltreatment (which may show a main_effect on its own), can influence
development of brain regions such as the amygdala and as a result some types of
behavioral response may be more likely. The generally unclear picture has been
compared to equally difficult findings obtained in regard to other complex
behavioral phenotypes.[107][108] For example, both 7R and 5R, ADHD-linked VNTR
alleles of dopamine_receptor_D4_gene are directly associated with the incidence
of proactive aggression in the men with no history of ADHD.[109]
***** Society and culture[edit] *****
Humans share aspects of aggression with non-human animals, and have specific
aspects and complexity related to factors such as genetics, early development,
social learning and flexibility, culture and morals. Konrad Lorenz stated in
his 1963 classic, On Aggression, that human behavior is shaped by four main,
survival-seeking animal drives. Taken together, these drives√¢¬Ä¬îhunger, fear,
reproduction, and aggression√¢¬Ä¬îachieve natural selection.[110] E._O._Wilson
elaborated in On Human Nature that aggression is, typically, a means of gaining
control over resources. Aggression is, thus, aggravated during times when high
population densities generate resource shortages.[111] According to Richard
Leakey and his colleagues, aggression in humans has also increased by becoming
more interested in ownership and by defending his or her property.[112]
However, UNESCO adopted the Seville Statement_of_Violence in 1989 that refuted
claims, by evolutionary scientists, that genetics by itself was the sole cause
of aggression.[113][114]
Social and cultural aspects may significantly interfere with the distinct
expression of aggressiveness. For example, a high population density, when
associated with a decrease of available resources, might be a significant
intervening variable for the occurrence of violent acts.[115]
**** Culture[edit] ****
Culture is one factor that plays a role in aggression. Tribal or band societies
existing before or outside of modern states have sometimes been depicted as
peaceful 'noble_savages'. The √á¬ÉKung_people were described as 'The Harmless
People' in a popular work by Elizabeth_Marshall_Thomas in 1958,[116] while
Lawrence Keeley's 1996 War_Before_Civilization suggested that regular warfare
without modern technology was conducted by most groups throughout human
history, including most Native_American tribes.[117] Studies of hunter-
gatherers show a range of different societies. In general, aggression, conflict
and violence sometimes occur, but direct confrontation is generally avoided and
conflict is socially managed by a variety of verbal and non-verbal methods.
Different rates of aggression or violence, currently or in the past, within or
between groups, have been linked to the structuring of societies and
environmental conditions influencing factors such as resource or property
acquisition, land and subsistence techniques, and population_change.[118]
American psychologist Peter_Gray hypothesizes that band hunter-gatherer
societies are able to reduce aggression while maintaining relatively peaceful,
egalitarian relations between members through various methods, such as
fostering a playful spirit in all areas of life, the use of humor to counter
the tendency of any one person to dominate the group, and non-coercive or
"indulgent" child-rearing practices. Gray likens hunter-gatherer bands to
social play groups, while stressing that such play is not frivolous or even
easy at all times.[119] According to Gray, "Social play√¢¬Ä¬îthat is, play
involving more than one player√¢¬Ä¬îis necessarily egalitarian. It always requires
a suspension of aggression and dominance along with a heightened sensitivity to
the needs and desires of the other players".[120]
Joan Durrant at the University_of_Manitoba writes that a number of studies have
found physical_punishment to be associated with "higher levels of aggression
against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other
factors.[121] According to Elizabeth_Gershoff at the University_of_Texas_at
Austin, the more that children are physically punished, the more likely they
are as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate
partners.[122] In countries where physical punishment of children is perceived
as being more culturally accepted, it is less strongly associated with
increased aggression; however, physical punishment has been found to predict
some increase in child aggression regardless of culture.[123] While these
associations do not prove causality, a number of longitudinal_studies suggest
that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later
aggressive behaviors.[121] In examining several longitudinal studies that
investigated the path from disciplinary spanking to aggression in children from
preschool age through adolescence, Gershoff concluded: "Spanking consistently
predicted increases in children's aggression over time, regardless of how
aggressive children were when the spanking occurred".[124] similar results were
found by Catherine Taylor at Tulane_University in 2010.[125] Family violence
researcher Murray_A._Straus argues, "There are many reasons this evidence has
been ignored. One of the most important is the belief that spanking is more
effective than nonviolent discipline and is, therefore, sometimes necessary,
despite the risk of harmful side effects".[126]
Analyzing aggression culturally or politically is complicated by the fact that
the label 'aggressive' can itself be used as a way of asserting a judgement
from a particular point of view.[according_to_whom?] Whether a coercive or
violent method of social control is perceived as aggression¬†√¢¬Ä¬ì or as
legitimate versus illegitimate aggression¬†√¢¬Ä¬ì depends on the position of the
relevant parties in relation to the social order of their culture. This in turn
can relate to factors such as: norms for coordinating actions and dividing
resources; what is considered self-defense or provocation; attitudes towards
'outsiders', attitudes towards specific groups such as women, the disabled or
the lower status; the availability of alternative conflict resolution
strategies; trade interdependence and collective_security pacts; fears and
impulses; and ultimate goals regarding material and social outcomes.[115]
Cross-cultural research has found differences in attitudes towards aggression
in different cultures. In one questionnaire study of university students, in
addition to men overall justifying some types of aggression more than women,
United States respondents justified defensive physical aggression more readily
than Japanese or Spanish respondents, whereas Japanese students preferred
direct verbal aggression (but not indirect) more than their American and
Spanish counterparts.[127] Within American culture, southern men were shown in
a study on university students to be more affected and to respond more
aggressively than northerners when randomly insulted after being bumped into,
which was theoretically related to a traditional culture_of_honor_in_the
Southern_United_States, or "saving_face".[128] Other cultural themes sometimes
applied to the study of aggression include individualistic versus collectivist
styles, which may relate, for example, to whether disputes are responded to
with open competition or by accommodating and avoiding_conflicts. In a study
including 62 countries school principals reported aggressive student behavior
more often the more individualist, and hence less collectivist, their country's
culture.[129] Other comparisons made in relation to aggression or war include
democratic versus authoritarian political_systems and egalitarian versus
stratified societies.[115] The economic_system known as capitalism has been
viewed by some as reliant on the leveraging of human competitiveness and
aggression in pursuit of resources and trade, which has been considered in both
positive and negative terms.[130] Attitudes about the social acceptability of
particular acts or targets of aggression are also important factors. This can
be highly controversial, as for example in disputes between religions or nation
states, for example in regard to the Arab√¢¬Ä¬ìIsraeli_conflict.[131][132]
*** Media[edit] ***
Main article: Media_violence_research
Some scholars believe that behaviors like aggression may be partially learned
by watching and imitating people's behavior, while other researchers have
concluded that the media may have some small effects on aggression.[133] There
is also research questioning this view.[134] For instance, a long-term outcome
study of youth found no long-term relationship between playing violent video
games and youth violence or bullying.[135] One study suggested there is a
smaller effect of violent video games on aggression than has been found with
television_violence on aggression. This effect is positively associated with
type of game violence and negatively_associated to time spent playing the
games.[136] The author concluded that insufficient evidence exists to link
video game violence with aggression. However, another study suggested links to
aggressive behavior.[137]
**** Fear-induced aggression[edit] ****
According to philosopher and neuroscientist Nayef_Al-Rodhan, "fear(survival)-
induced pre-emptive_aggression" is a human reaction to injustices that are
perceived to threaten survival. It is often the root of the unthinkable
brutality and injustice perpetuated by human beings. It may occur at any time,
even in situations that appear to be calm and under control. Where there is
injustice that is perceived as posing a threat to survival, "fear(survival)-
induced pre-emptive aggression" will result in individuals taking whatever
action necessary to be free from that threat.
Nayef Al-Rodhan argues that humans' strong tendency towards "fear(survival)-
induced pre-emptive aggression" means that situations of anarchy or near
anarchy should be prevented at all costs. This is because anarchy provokes
fear, which in turn results in aggression, brutality, and injustice. Even in
non-anarchic situations, survival_instincts and fear can be very powerful
forces, and they may be incited instantaneously. "Fear(survival)-induced pre-
emptive aggression" is one of the key factors that may push naturally amoral
humans to behave in immoral ways.[138] Knowing this, Al-Rodhan maintains that
we must prepare for the circumstances that may arise from humans' aggressive
behavior. According to Al-Rodhan, the risk of this aggression and its ensuing
brutality should be minimized through confidence-building_measures and policies
that promote inclusiveness and prevent anarchy.[139]
**** Children[edit] ****
The frequency of physical aggression in humans peaks at around 2√¢¬Ä¬ì3 years of
age. It then declines gradually on average.[140][141] These observations
suggest that physical aggression is not only a learned behavior but that
development provides opportunities for the learning and biological development
of self-regulation. However, a small subset of children fail to acquire all the
necessary self-regulatory abilities and tend to show atypical levels of
physical aggression across development. These may be at risk for later violent
behavior or, conversely, lack of aggression that may be considered necessary
within society. Some findings suggest that early aggression does not
necessarily lead to aggression later on, however, although the course through
early childhood is an important predictor of outcomes in middle childhood. In
addition, physical aggression that continues is likely occurring in the context
of family adversity, including socioeconomic factors. Moreover, 'opposition'
and 'status violations' in childhood appear to be more strongly linked to
social problems in adulthood than simply aggressive antisocial behavior.[142]
[143] Social learning through interactions in early childhood has been seen as
a building block for levels of aggression which play a crucial role in the
development of peer relationships in middle childhood.[144] Overall, an
interplay of biological, social and environmental factors can be considered.
[145] Some research indicates that changes in the weather can increase the
likelihood of children exhibiting deviant behavior.[146]
*** Typical expectations[edit] ***
    * Young children preparing to enter kindergarten need to develop the
      socially important skill of being assertive. Examples of assertiveness
      include asking others for information, initiating conversation, or being
      able to respond to peer_pressure.
    * In contrast, some young children use aggressive behavior, such as hitting
      or biting, as a form of communication.
    * Aggressive behavior can impede learning as a skill deficit, while
      assertive behavior can facilitate learning. However, with young children,
      aggressive behavior is developmentally appropriate and can lead to
      opportunities of building conflict resolution and communication skills.
    * By school age, children should learn more socially appropriate forms of
      communicating such as expressing themselves through verbal or written
      language; if they have not, this behavior may signify a disability or
      developmental delay.
*** Aggression triggers[edit] ***
    * Physical_fear_of_others
    * Family_difficulties
    * Learning, neurological, or conduct/behavior_disorders
    * Psychological_trauma
The Bobo_doll_experiment was conducted by Albert Bandura in 1961. In this work,
Bandura found that children exposed to an aggressive adult model acted more
aggressively than those who were exposed to a nonaggressive adult model. This
experiment suggests that anyone who comes in contact with and interacts with
children can affect the way they react and handle situations.[147]
  Summary points from recommendations by national associations
    * American_Academy_of_Pediatrics (2011): "The best way to prevent
      aggressive behavior is to give your child a stable, secure home life with
      firm, loving discipline and full-time supervision during the toddler and
      preschool years. Everyone who cares for your child should be a good role
      model and agree on the rules he's expected to observe as well as the
      response to use if he disobeys."[148]
    * National_Association_of_School_Psychologists (2008): "Proactive
      aggression is typically reasoned, unemotional, and focused on acquiring
      some goal. For example, a bully wants peer approval and victim
      submission, and gang members want status and control. In contrast,
      reactive aggression is frequently highly emotional and is often the
      result of biased or deficient cognitive processing on the part of the
      student."[149]
**** Gender[edit] ****
See also: Sex_and_psychology
Gender is a factor that plays a role in both human and animal aggression. Males
are historically believed to be generally more physically aggressive than
females from an early age,[150][151] and men commit the vast majority of
murders (Buss 2005). This is one of the most robust and reliable behavioral sex
differences, and it has been found across many different age groups and
cultures. However, some empirical_studies have found the discrepancy in male
and female aggression to be more pronounced in childhood and the gender
difference in adults to be modest when studied in an experimental context.[47]
Still, there is evidence that males are quicker to aggression (Frey et al.
2003) and more likely than females to express their aggression physically.[152]
When considering indirect forms of non-violent aggression, such as relational
aggression and social_rejection, some scientists argue that females can be
quite aggressive, although female aggression is rarely expressed physically.
[153][154][155] An exception is intimate_partner_violence that occurs among
couples who are engaged, married, or in some other form of intimate
relationship.
Although females are less likely than males to initiate physical violence, they
can express aggression by using a variety of non-physical means. Exactly which
method women use to express aggression is something that varies from culture to
culture. On Bellona_Island, a culture based on male dominance and physical
violence, women tend to get into conflicts with other women more frequently
than with men. When in conflict with males, instead of using physical means,
they make up songs mocking the man, which spread across the island and
humiliate him. If a woman wanted to kill a man, she would either convince her
male relatives to kill him or hire an assassin. Although these two methods
involve physical violence, both are forms of indirect aggression, since the
aggressor herself avoids getting directly involved or putting herself in
immediate physical danger.[156]
See also the sections on testosterone and evolutionary_explanations for gender
differences above.
**** Situational factors[edit] ****
See also: Stereotype_threat
There has been some links between those prone to violence and their alcohol
use. Those who are prone to violence and use alcohol are more likely to carry
out violent acts.[157] Alcohol impairs judgment, making people much less
cautious than they usually are (MacDonald et al. 1996). It also disrupts the
way information is processed (Bushman 1993, 1997; Bushman & Cooper 1990).
Pain and discomfort also increase aggression. Even the simple act of placing
one's hands in hot water can cause an aggressive response. Hot temperatures
have been implicated as a factor in a number of studies. One study completed in
the midst of the civil rights movement found that riots were more likely on
hotter days than cooler ones (Carlsmith & Anderson 1979). Students were found
to be more aggressive and irritable after taking a test in a hot classroom
(Anderson et al. 1996, Rule, et al. 1987). Drivers in cars without air
conditioning were also found to be more likely to honk their horns (Kenrick &
MacFarlane 1986), which is used as a measure of aggression and has shown links
to other factors such as generic symbols of aggression or the visibility of
other drivers.[158]
Frustration is another major cause of aggression. The Frustration_aggression
theory states that aggression increases if a person feels that he or she is
being blocked from achieving a goal (Aronson et al. 2005). One study found that
the closeness to the goal makes a difference. The study examined people waiting
in line and concluded that the 2nd person was more aggressive than the 12th one
when someone cut in line (Harris 1974). Unexpected frustration may be another
factor. In a separate study to demonstrate how unexpected frustration leads to
increased aggression, Kulik & Brown (1979) selected a group of students as
volunteers to make calls for charity donations. One group was told that the
people they would call would be generous and the collection would be very
successful. The other group was given no expectations. The group that expected
success was more upset when no one was pledging than the group who did not
expect success (everyone actually had horrible success). This research suggests
that when an expectation does not materialize (successful collections),
unexpected frustration arises which increases aggression.
There is some evidence to suggest that the presence of violent objects such as
a gun can trigger aggression. In a study done by Leonard_Berkowitz and Anthony
Le Page (1967), college students were made angry and then left in the presence
of a gun or badminton racket. They were then led to believe they were
delivering electric shocks to another student, as in the Milgram_experiment.
Those who had been in the presence of the gun administered more shocks. It is
possible that a violence-related stimulus increases the likelihood of
aggressive cognitions by activating the semantic_network.
A new proposal links military experience to anger and aggression, developing
aggressive reactions and investigating these effects on those possessing the
traits of a serial killer. Castle and Hensley state, "The military provides the
social context where servicemen learn aggression, violence, and murder."[159]
Post-traumatic_stress_disorder (PTSD) is also a serious issue in the military,
also believed to sometimes lead to aggression in soldiers who are suffering
from what they witnessed in battle. They come back to the civilian world and
may still be haunted by flashbacks and nightmares, causing severe stress. In
addition, it has been claimed that in the rare minority who are claimed to be
inclined toward serial killing, violent impulses may be reinforced and refined
in war, possibly creating more effective murderers.[citation_needed]
**** As a positive adaptation theory[edit] ****
Some recent scholarship has questioned traditional psychological
conceptualizations of aggression as universally negative.[33] Most traditional
psychological definitions of aggression focus on the harm to the recipient of
the aggression, implying this is the intent of the aggressor; however this may
not always be the case.[160] From this alternate view, although the recipient
may or may not be harmed, the perceived intent is to increase the status of the
aggressor, not necessarily to harm the recipient.[161] Such scholars contend
that traditional definitions of aggression have no validity.[citation_needed]
From this view, rather than concepts such as assertiveness, aggression,
violence and criminal violence existing as distinct constructs, they exist
instead along a continuum with moderate levels of aggression being most
adaptive.[33] Such scholars do not consider this a trivial difference, noting
that many traditional researchers' aggression measurements may measure outcomes
lower down in the continuum, at levels which are adaptive, yet they generalize
their findings to non-adaptive levels of aggression, thus losing precision.
