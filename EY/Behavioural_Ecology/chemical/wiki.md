****** Chemical substance ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

"Chemical" redirects here. For other uses, see Chemical_(disambiguation).
Steam and liquid water are two different forms of the same chemical substance,
water.
A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition
and characteristic properties.[1][2] A chemical substance cannot be separated
into its constituent elements by physical separation methods, i.e., without
breaking chemical_bonds.[3] Chemical substances can be simple_substances[4],
chemical_compounds, or alloys. Chemical_elements may or may not be included in
the definition, depending on expert viewpoint.[4]
Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures. A
common example of a chemical substance is pure water; it has the same
properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from
a river or made in a laboratory. Other chemical substances commonly encountered
in pure form are diamond (carbon), gold, table_salt (sodium_chloride) and
refined sugar (sucrose). However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure,
and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical.
Chemical substances exist as solids, liquids, gases, or plasma, and may change
between these phases_of_matter with changes in temperature or pressure.
Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical
reactions.
Forms of energy, such as light and heat, are not matter, and are thus not
"substances" in this regard.

***** Definition[edit] *****
Colors of a single chemical (Nile_red) in different solvents, under visible and
UV light, showing how the chemical interacts dynamically with its solvent
environment.
A chemical substance may well be defined as "any material with a definite
chemical composition" in an introductory general chemistry textbook.[5]
According to this definition a chemical substance can either be a pure chemical
element or a pure chemical compound. But, there are exceptions to this
definition; a pure substance can also be defined as a form of matter that has
both definite composition and distinct properties.[6] The chemical substance
index published by CAS also includes several alloys of uncertain composition.
[7] Non-stoichiometric_compounds are a special case (in inorganic_chemistry)
that violates the law of constant composition, and for them, it is sometimes
difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound, as in the case of
palladium_hydride. Broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can
be found, for example: "the term 'chemical substance' means any organic or
inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including â (i) any
combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a
chemical reaction or occurring in nature".[8]
In geology, substances of uniform composition are called minerals, while
physical mixtures (aggregates) of several minerals (different substances) are
defined as rocks. Many minerals, however, mutually dissolve into solid
solutions, such that a single rock is a uniform substance despite being a
mixture in stoichiometric terms. Feldspars are a common example: anorthoclase
is an alkali aluminum silicate, where the alkali metal is interchangeably
either sodium or potassium.
In law, "chemical substances" may include both pure substances and mixtures
with a defined composition or manufacturing process. For example, the EU
regulation REACH defines "monoconstituent substances", "multiconstituent
substances" and "substances of unknown or variable composition". The latter two
consist of multiple chemical substances; however, their identity can be
established either by direct chemical analysis or reference to a single
manufacturing process. For example, charcoal is an extremely complex, partially
polymeric mixture that can be defined by its manufacturing process. Therefore,
although the exact chemical identity is unknown, identification can be made to
a sufficient accuracy. The CAS index also includes mixtures.
Polymers almost always appear as mixtures of molecules of multiple molar
masses, each of which could be considered a separate chemical substance.
However, the polymer may be defined by a known precursor or reaction(s) and the
molar_mass_distribution. For example, polyethylene is a mixture of very long
chains of -CH2- repeating units, and is generally sold in several molar mass
distributions, LDPE, MDPE, HDPE and UHMWPE.
***** History[edit] *****
The concept of a "chemical substance" became firmly established in the late
eighteenth century after work by the chemist Joseph_Proust on the composition
of some pure chemical compounds such as basic_copper_carbonate.[9] He deduced
that, "All samples of a compound have the same composition; that is, all
samples have the same proportions, by mass, of the elements present in the
compound." This is now known as the law_of_constant_composition.[10] Later with
the advancement of methods for chemical_synthesis particularly in the realm of
organic_chemistry; the discovery of many more chemical elements and new
techniques in the realm of analytical_chemistry used for isolation and
purification of elements and compounds from chemicals that led to the
establishment of modern chemistry, the concept was defined as is found in most
chemistry textbooks. However, there are some controversies regarding this
definition mainly because the large number of chemical substances reported in
chemistry literature need to be indexed.
Isomerism caused much consternation to early researchers, since isomers have
exactly the same composition, but differ in configuration (arrangement) of the
atoms. For example, there was much speculation for the chemical identity of
benzene, until the correct structure was described by Friedrich_August_KekulÃ©.
Likewise, the idea of stereoisomerism â that atoms have rigid three-
dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their
three-dimensional arrangement â was another crucial step in understanding the
concept of distinct chemical substances. For example, tartaric_acid has three
distinct isomers, a pair of diastereomers with one diastereomer forming two
enantiomers.
***** Chemical elements[edit] *****
Native sulfur crystals. Sulfur occurs naturally as elemental sulfur, in sulfide
and sulfate minerals and in hydrogen_sulfide.
Main article: Chemical_element
See also: List_of_elements
An element is a chemical substance made up of a particular kind of atom and
hence cannot be broken down or transformed by a chemical reaction into a
different element, though it can be transmuted into another element through a
nuclear_reaction. This is so, because all of the atoms in a sample of an
element have the same number of protons, though they may be different isotopes,
with differing numbers of neutrons.
As of 2012, there are 118 known elements, about 80 of which are stable â that
is, they do not change by radioactive_decay into other elements. Some elements
can occur as more than a single chemical substance (allotropes). For instance,
oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3). The majority of
elements are classified as metals. These are elements with a characteristic
lustre such as iron, copper, and gold. Metals typically conduct electricity and
heat well, and they are malleable and ductile.[11] Around a dozen elements,[12]
such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are classified as non-metals. Non-metals
lack the metallic properties described above, they also have a high
electronegativity and a tendency to form negative_ions. Certain elements such
as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non-metals, and are
known as metalloids.
***** Chemical compounds[edit] *****
Potassium_ferricyanide is a compound of potassium, iron, carbon and nitrogen;
although it contains cyanide anions, it does not release them and is nontoxic.
Main article: Chemical_compound
See also: List_of_organic_compounds and List_of_inorganic_compounds
A pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a
particular set of molecules or ions. Two or more elements combined into one
substance through a chemical_reaction form a chemical_compound. All compounds
are substances, but not all substances are compounds.
A chemical compound can be either atoms bonded together in molecules or
crystals in which atoms, molecules or ions form a crystalline_lattice.
Compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called organic
compounds, and all others are called inorganic_compounds. Compounds containing
bonds between carbon and a metal are called organometallic_compounds.
Compounds in which components share electrons are known as covalent compounds.
Compounds consisting of oppositely charged ions are known as ionic compounds,
or salts.
In organic chemistry, there can be more than one chemical compound with the
same composition and molecular weight. Generally, these are called isomers.
Isomers usually have substantially different chemical properties, and often may
be isolated without spontaneously interconverting. A common example is glucose
vs. fructose. The former is an aldehyde, the latter is a ketone. Their
interconversion requires either enzymatic or acid-base_catalysis.
However, tautomers are an exception: the isomerization occurs spontaneously in
ordinary conditions, such that a pure substance cannot be isolated into its
tautomers, even if these can be identified spectroscopically or even isolated
in special conditions. A common example is glucose, which has open-chain and
ring forms. One cannot manufacture pure open-chain glucose because glucose
spontaneously cyclizes to the hemiacetal form.
***** Substances versus mixtures[edit] *****
Cranberry glass, while it looks homogeneous, is a mixture consisting of glass
and gold colloidal particles of ca. 40 nm diameter, which give it a red color.
Main article: Mixture
All matter consists of various elements and chemical compounds, but these are
often intimately mixed together. Mixtures contain more than one chemical
substance, and they do not have a fixed composition. In principle, they can be
separated into the component substances by purely mechanical processes. Butter,
soil and wood are common examples of mixtures.
Grey iron metal and yellow sulfur are both chemical elements, and they can be
mixed together in any ratio to form a yellow-grey mixture. No chemical process
occurs, and the material can be identified as a mixture by the fact that the
sulfur and the iron can be separated by a mechanical process, such as using a
magnet to attract the iron away from the sulfur.
In contrast, if iron and sulfur are heated together in a certain ratio (1 atom
of iron for each atom of sulfur, or by weight, 56 grams (1 mol) of iron to
32 grams (1 mol) of sulfur), a chemical reaction takes place and a new
substance is formed, the compound iron(II)_sulfide, with chemical formula FeS.
The resulting compound has all the properties of a chemical substance and is
not a mixture. Iron(II) sulfide has its own distinct properties such as melting
point and solubility, and the two elements cannot be separated using normal
mechanical processes; a magnet will be unable to recover the iron, since there
is no metallic iron present in the compound.
***** Chemicals versus chemical substances[edit] *****
While the term chemical substance is a precise technical term that is
synonymous with chemical for chemists, the word chemical is used in general
usage in the English speaking world to refer to both (pure) chemical substances
and mixtures (often called compounds),[13] and especially when produced or
purified in a laboratory or an industrial process.[14][15][16] In other words,
the chemical substances of which fruits and vegetables, for example, are
naturally composed even when growing wild are not called "chemicals" in general
usage. In countries that require a list of ingredients in products, the
"chemicals" listed are industrially produced "chemical substances". The word
"chemical" is also often used to refer to addictive, narcotic, or mind-altering
drugs.[14][15]
Within the chemical industry, manufactured "chemicals" are chemical substances,
which can be classified by production volume into bulk chemicals, fine
chemicals and chemicals found in research only:
    * Bulk chemicals are produced in very large quantities, usually with highly
      optimized continuous processes and to a relatively low price.
    * Fine chemicals are produced at a high cost in small quantities for
      special low-volume applications such as biocides, pharmaceuticals and
      speciality chemicals for technical applications.
    * Research chemicals are produced individually for research, such as when
      searching for synthetic routes or screening substances for pharmaceutical
      activity. In effect, their price per gram is very high, although they are
      not sold.
The cause of the difference in production volume is the complexity of the
molecular structure of the chemical. Bulk chemicals are usually much less
complex. While fine chemicals may be more complex, many of them are simple
enough to be sold as "building blocks" in the synthesis of more complex
molecules targeted for single use, as named above. The production of a chemical
includes not only its synthesis but also its purification to eliminate by-
products and impurities involved in the synthesis. The last step in production
should be the analysis of batch lots of chemicals in order to identify and
quantify the percentages of impurities for the buyer of the chemicals. The
required purity and analysis depends on the application, but higher tolerance
of impurities is usually expected in the production of bulk chemicals. Thus,
the user of the chemical in the US might choose between the bulk or "technical
grade" with higher amounts of impurities or a much purer "pharmaceutical grade"
(labeled "USP", United_States_Pharmacopeia). "Chemicals" in the commercial and
legal sense may also include mixtures of highly variable composition, as they
are products made to a technical specification instead of particular chemical
substances. For example, gasoline is not a single chemical compound or even a
particular mixture: different gasolines can have very different chemical
compositions, as "gasoline" is primarily defined through source, properties and
octane_rating.
***** Naming and indexing[edit] *****
Every chemical substance has one or more systematic_names, usually named
according to the IUPAC_rules_for_naming. An alternative system is used by the
Chemical_Abstracts_Service (CAS).
Many compounds are also known by their more common, simpler names, many of
which predate the systematic name. For example, the long-known sugar glucose is
now systematically named 6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol. Natural
products and pharmaceuticals are also given simpler names, for example the mild
pain-killer Naproxen is the more common name for the chemical compound (S)-6-
methoxy-Î±-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid.
Chemists frequently refer to chemical_compounds using chemical_formulae or
molecular_structure of the compound. There has been a phenomenal growth in the
number of chemical compounds being synthesized (or isolated), and then reported
in the scientific_literature by professional chemists around the world.[17] An
enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical
combination of the known chemical elements. As of May 2011, about sixty million
chemical compounds are known.[18] The names of many of these compounds are
often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately. Also
it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature. Several
international organizations like IUPAC and CAS have initiated steps to make
such tasks easier. CAS provides the abstracting services of the chemical
literature, and provides a numerical identifier, known as CAS_registry_number
to each chemical substance that has been reported in the chemical literature
(such as chemistry_journals and patents). This information is compiled as a
database and is popularly known as the Chemical substances index. Other
computer-friendly systems that have been developed for substance information,
are: SMILES and the International_Chemical_Identifier or InChI.

***** Isolation, purification, characterization, and identification[edit] *****
Often a pure substance needs to be isolated from a mixture, for example from a
natural_source (where a sample often contains numerous chemical substances) or
after a chemical_reaction (which often give mixtures of chemical substances).
