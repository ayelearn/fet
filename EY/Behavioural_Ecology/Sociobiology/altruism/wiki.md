Principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others
For the concept in behavioral ecology, see Altruism_(biology).
Giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.
Altruism is the principle and moral_practice of concern for happiness of other
human_beings and/or animals, resulting in a quality_of_life both material and
spiritual. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of
various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of
"others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and
religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness
which is the opposite of selfishness.
The word "altruism" was coined by the French philosopher Auguste_Comte in
French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism.[1][2] He derived it from the
Italian altrui, which in turn was derived from Latin alteri, meaning "other
people" or "somebody else".[3]
Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms
is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g.,
pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction),
but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual,
without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action.
Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is
"intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another
person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards".[4] In one sense,
the opposite of altruism is spite; a spiteful action harms another with no
self-benefit.
Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty, in that whilst the
latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider
relationships. Much debate exists as to whether "true" altruism is possible in
human psychology. The theory of psychological_egoism suggests that no act of
sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the
actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification.
The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic_rewards qualify as
"benefits".
The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that
individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is
usually contrasted with egoism, which claims individuals are morally obligated
to serve themselves first. Effective_altruism is the use of evidence and reason
to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.

***** The notion of altruism[edit] *****
The concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought. The term
was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and
philosopher_of_science, Auguste_Comte, and has become a major topic for
psychologists (especially evolutionary_psychology researchers), evolutionary
biologists, and ethologists. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can
affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields
always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is
caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.
***** Scientific viewpoints[edit] *****
**** Anthropology[edit] ****
Marcel_Mauss's book The Gift contains a passage called "Note on alms". This
note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of
altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:
     Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on
     the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity
     is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for
     the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who
     should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the
     gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the
     spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been
     offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices
     should serve the poor and children.

**** Evolutionary explanations[edit] ****
Main articles: Altruism_in_animals, Evolution_of_morality, and Evolutionary
ethics
Giving alms to beggar children
In the science of ethology (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally
in the study of social_evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual
that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness
of the actor.[5] In evolutionary_psychology this may be applied to a wide range
of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners,
tipping, courtship gifts, production of public_goods, and environmentalism.[6]
Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to
produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of
research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and
from evolutionary_game_theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural
strategies.
Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
    * Kin_selection.[7] That animals and humans are more altruistic towards
      close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous
      studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating
      kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue
      is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs
      so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants
      increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted
      persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare,
      and this has been found to increase helpful behavior. Another study found
      more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a
      group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience
      agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially
      strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.[6]
    * Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies,
      and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear. Helping such group
      members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist. Making ingroup
      membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness. Extreme self-
      sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup
      threatens to kill the entire ingroup.[6]
    * Reciprocal_altruism.[8] See also Reciprocity_(evolution).
          o Direct reciprocity.[9] Research shows that it can be beneficial to
            help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate
            the help. The effective tit_for_tat strategy is one game_theoretic
            example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by
            cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.[6]
                  One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is
                  more likely that individuals will interact again in the
                  future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive
                  that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower.
                  They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by
                  others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite
                  effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the
                  cooperative framing of a proposal may increase
                  cooperativeness such as calling it a "Community Game" instead
                  of a "Wall Street Game."[6]
                  A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel
                  obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been
                  used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors
                  hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to
                  announce publicly that someone has given a large donation.
                  The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people
                  become more helpful toward others in general after being
                  helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even
                  retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating.
                  People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended
                  to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause
                  unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy
                  to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous
                  interpretation of non-cooperation.[6]
                  People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can
                  communicate with one another first. This may be due to better
                  assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of
                  promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually
                  build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help
                  immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group
                  can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from
                  intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as
                  between groups or against the general population. Thus,
                  giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's
                  performance relative to a small local group, as is common,
                  may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.[6]
          o Indirect reciprocity.[10] The avoidance of poor reciprocators and
            cheaters causes a person's reputation to become very important. A
            person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance
            of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct
            interactions with previously.[6]
          o Strong_reciprocity.[11] A form of reciprocity where some
            individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and
            punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several
            established theories of altruism. A number of theories have been
            proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its
            existence.
          o Pseudo-reciprocity.[12] An organism behaves altruistically and the
            recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of
            acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits
            the altruist.
    * Costly_signaling and the handicap_principle.[13] Since altruism takes
      away resources from the altruist it can be an "honest signal" of resource
      availability and the abilities needed to gather resources. This may
      signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It
      may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since
      those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly
      signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term
      cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who
      help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits,
      resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more
      important signal if the population increasingly varies on these
      characteristics.[6]
      Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of
      ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive
      success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no
      more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts
      and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's
      resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly
      signal of ability.[6]
Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the Houston_Astrodome, following
Hurricane Katrina.
      Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of
      reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will
      be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be
      communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly
      announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else.
      This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to
      subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized
      eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues
      such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues
      present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless
      reinforced with real reputational effects.[6] Public displays such as
      public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations
      may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know
      that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money
      they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of
      reputational concerns.[14]
      Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners.
      When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait
      as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her
      and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in
      the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the
      presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is
      the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men
      place less value on this than women and that women may not be more
      altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid
      altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they
      expect less success.[6][14]
      People may compete for social benefit from a burnished reputation, which
      may cause competitive_altruism. On the other hand, in some experiments a
      proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not
      help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to
      reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need
      not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur
      in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the
      present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on
      future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have
      shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less
      cooperative.[6]
      Explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes
      actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic
      rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may
      replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives,
      motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which
      overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that
      people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic
      rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out
      that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce
      them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists,
      especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that
      doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at
      all.[6]
    * Group_selection. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary
      scientists such as David_Sloan_Wilson that natural selection can act at
      the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin
      group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level.
      Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be
      outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according
      to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where
      groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups
      consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend
      to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism
      against outgroup members (See also in-group_favoritism). Group selection
      theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.[15][16]

Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating
how to increase their inclusive_fitness when they are doing altruistic acts.
Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that
promote altruistic behaviors.[6]
Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive
fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on
average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not
imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the
altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right
person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and
usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.[6]
The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being
more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more
altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those
attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors,
and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.[6]
The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George_R._Price's
development of the Price_equation, which is a mathematical equation used to
study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the
cellular slime_moulds, such as Dictyostelium mucoroides. These protists live as
individual amoebae until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a
multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote
the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.
Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated
emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to
facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one
another for survival and reproductive success.[17]
Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing
politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter_Kropotkin in his
1902 book Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution and Peter_Singer in his book A
Darwinian_Left.
**** Neurobiology[edit] ****
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the National_Institutes_of
Health and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for
the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using
functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging. In their research, published in the
Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences USA in October 2006,[18] they
showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the
mesolimbic reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds
to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of
others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit
was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal_region. These structures
are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species.
Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that
suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired
and pleasurable.[19] One brain region, the subgenual anterior_cingulate cortex/
basal_forebrain, contributes to learning altruistic behavior, especially in
those with trait empathy.[20] The same study has shown a connection between
giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding.[21]
In fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the University_of_Southern
California neuroscientist Antonio_R._Damasio and his colleagues showed that
subjects with damage to the ventromedial_prefrontal_cortex lack the ability to
empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that when confronted with
moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with "end-
justifies-the-means" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was
not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted
by a difficult issue â in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger
plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city â these patients
appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally
functioning brains. According to Adrian_Raine, a clinical neuroscientist also
at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is
that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: "Psychopaths
often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying
exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral
thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of
accountability?"[19]
In another study, in the 1990s, Dr. Bill Harbaugh, a University_of_Oregon
economist, concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal
prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist
colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and
Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the
study group into two groups: "egoists" and "altruists". One of their
discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered "egoists"
sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to
the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity, such as a
person's environment and values.[21]
**** Psychology[edit] ****
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines psychological
altruism as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing anotherâs
welfare." Psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism, which
refers to the motivation to increase one's own welfare.[22]
There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of
psychological altruism.[23] Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature
to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.[24]
However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the
selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The social_exchange
theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh
costs to the self.[25] Daniel_Batson is a psychologist who examined this
question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four
major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism),
to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group
(collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (principlism). Altruism that
ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism,
but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be
genuinely selfless.[26] The empathy-altruism hypothesis basically states that
psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help
someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with
feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own
unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even
when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking
in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid
exposure to another's suffering.[22] Helping behavior is seen in humans at
about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle
emotional cues.[27]
Peace_Corps trainees swearing in as volunteers in Cambodia, 4 April 2007
In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as
demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing,
cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.[24] Research has found that
people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and
feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also
suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects
the likelihood of helping (the Bystander_effect). Greater numbers of bystanders
decrease individual feelings of responsibility.[22][28] However, a witness with
a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility
entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.[22]
Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism)
on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between
volunteerism and current and future health and well-being.[29][30] In a study
of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and
will to live, and lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization.[31]
Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental
health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity
and social integration it encourages.[29][32][33][34] One study examined the
physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that
52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major
illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one.[35] A study
on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who
volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying.
After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism
accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality.[36] Merely being aware of kindness
in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that
asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week
significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.[37] It is important to note
that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about
happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite directionâthat
happier people are also kinder. The relationship between altruistic behavior
and happiness is bidirectional. Studies have found that generosity increases
linearly from sad to happy affective states.[38]
Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of
others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness.[34] For
example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others'
demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had
a positive one (although positive effects were still significant).[39]
Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is
also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others.
Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very
important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various
character strengths showed that "a conscious focus on gratitude led to
reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive
affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.".[40]
**** Sociology[edit] ****
"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society"
("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity". American Sociological
Association.[41]). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to
exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for
the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American
Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges public_sociology saying, "The
intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of
investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable"
("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA). This type of sociology seeks
contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what
motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in
order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed,
organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of
focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the
groups it studies and "build the good society". The motivation of altruism is
also the focus of study; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage
to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims.[42]

**** Pathological altruism[edit] ****
Pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and
either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm
than good.
The term "pathological altruism" was popularised by the book Pathological
Altruism.
Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an
unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of
animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately
worsen the situations they are meant to aid.[43]
***** Religious viewpoints[edit] *****
See also: Evolutionary_origin_of_religions
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important
moral value. Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, and
Sikhism, etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.
**** Buddhism[edit] ****
Monks collecting alms
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of
all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish
that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free
from suffering. "Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and
compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the
need for them lies at the very core of our being" (Dalai_Lama).[44]
Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the
belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care
for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes"
(Dalai Lama[44]).
In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment,
Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of
our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment,
but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and
effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of
experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a
natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness,
then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.
**** Jainism[edit] ****

Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of ahimsa (non-injury)
The fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism,
not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of
Ahimsa â to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e.
uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to
be equal. The first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev, introduced the concept of altruism
for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to
donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all
living things.
Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate
goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences
of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with
anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the
powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys
humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism
recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by
straightforwardness and greed by contentment.
Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must
practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and
action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for
householders and monks. They are:
   1. Non-violence (Ahimsa);
   2. Truthfulness (Satya);
   3. Non-stealing (Asteya);
   4. Celibacy (Brahmacharya);
   5. Non-possession or non-materialism (Aparigraha);
The "great vows" (Mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows"
(Anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to
practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very
strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the
limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.
The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the
capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because
it has the potential to become Siddha (God_in_Jainism). Because all living
beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions.
Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards
all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to
microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different
capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels
of compliance for ascetics and householders.
**** Christianity[edit] ****
Statue of Mother_Teresa in India
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel, especially
in the Sermon_on_the_Mount and the Sermon_on_the_Plain. From biblical to
medieval Christian_traditions, tensions between self-affirmation and other-
regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as
in the Pauline phrase "love seeks not its own interests." In his book
Indoctrination and Self-deception, Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on
these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation
and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the
self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms
others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its
presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but
by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the
presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and
reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.
St_Thomas_Aquinas interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself'[45]
as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.[46]
Considering that "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root
of friendship" and quotes Aristotle that "the origin of friendly relations with
others lies in our relations to ourselves,"[47] he concluded that though we are
not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common
good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part.
However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours,
and more than our bodily lifeâsince the ultimate purpose of loving our
neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily
well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably
opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools
within Catholicism.
Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love
of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman,
and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. Thomas_Jay
Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of
love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism
as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that
sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands
undermine overall well-being.
German philosopher Max_Scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can
help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by
a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the
invincible fullness of oneâs own life and existence".[48] Another way is
merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge
to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peopleâs business."
[49] At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and
the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to
detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength,
power, largesse."[50]
**** Islam[edit] ****
In Islam, the concept 'ithaar' (Ø¥ÙØ«Ø§Ø±) (altruism) is the notion of
'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others
through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others
is rooted to be a demand made by ALLAH on the human body, considered to be
property of ALLAH alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the
greater good; Islam considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest
degree of nobility.[51] This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike
that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in
existence. A constant concern for ALLAH (i.e. God) results in a careful
attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.[52] This
concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like Rabia_al-Adawiyya who paid
attention to the difference between dedication to ALLAH (i.e. God) and
dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet Yunus_Emre explained
this philosophy as "YaratÄ±lanÄ± severiz, Yaratandan Ã¶tÃ¼rÃ¼" or We love the
creature, because of The Creator. For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as
a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is
also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all
times.
**** Judaism[edit] ****
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi
Abraham_Isaac_Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in
humanity.[53] This is defined as bestowal, or giving, which is the intention of
altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards
the creator or God. Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence.
Rabbi Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation'
and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with
this upper force.[54]
Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda_Ashlag, in his writings about the
future_generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social
framework.[55] Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of
creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of
altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to
divinity.[56]
**** Sikhism[edit] ****
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. The central faith in Sikhism is
that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities
like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The concept
of "seva," or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an
important concept in Sikhism.[57]
The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of
pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The ninth Guru,
Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people
against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, Guru_Gobind_Singh Ji (the
tenth guru in Sikhism), was in war with the Mughal rulers to protect the people
of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, Bhai_Kanhaiya, attended the troops of
the enemy.[58] He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the
battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were
annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought
Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that
they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield."What
were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru. "I was giving water to the wounded
because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru
responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You
were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru."
It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a
volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in
doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.
[59]
**** Hinduism[edit] ****
In Hinduism Selflessness (Atmatyag), Love (Prema), Kindness (Daya) and
Forgiveness (Kshama) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or
"Manushyattva". Giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a
divine act or "Punya" and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or
"Paapa" and will led them to heaven or "Swarga" in afterlife. Altruism is also
the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs.
Swami_Vivekananda, the legendary Hindu monk, has said -"Jive prem kare jeijon,
Seijon sebiche Iswar" (Whoever loves any living being, is serving god.). Mass
donation of clothes to poor people (Vastraseva), or blood donation camp or mass
food donation (Annaseva) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious
ceremonies.
Swami_Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the views in his commentary
synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma_Sutras, a Vedantic text. In his
commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is
insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed.
Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to
one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or
punya, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless
moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow
reward or punishment.
However the very well known and popular text, the Bhagavad_Gita supports the
doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) & "nishkaama
karma" or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be
said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very
well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.[60]
***** Philosophy[edit] *****
Main article: Altruism_(ethics)
There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or
motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of ethical_altruism maintain that
individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is
ethical_egoism, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their
own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with
utilitarianism, which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise
the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-
inhabitants.
A related concept in descriptive_ethics is psychological_egoism, the thesis
that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is
impossible. Rational_egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in
one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral
obligations).
**** Effective altruism[edit] ****
Main article: Effective_altruism
Effective_altruism is a philosophy and social_movement that uses evidence and
reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.[61] Effective
altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act
in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their
values.[62] It is the broad, evidence-based and cause-neutral approach that
distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.[63]
Effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based
practices.
While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the
nonprofit_sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to
prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which
can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest
benefit.[64] People associated with the movement include philosopher Peter
Singer,[65] Facebook cofounder Dustin_Moskovitz,[66] Cari Tuna,[67] Ben_Delo,
[68] Oxford-based researchers William_MacAskill[69] and Toby_Ord,[70]
professional poker player Liv_Boeree,[71][72] and writer Jacy_Reese.[73]
***** Genetics[edit] *****
The genes OXTR, CD38, COMT, DRD4, DRD5, IGF2, GABRB2 have been found to be
candidate genes for altruism.[74]
