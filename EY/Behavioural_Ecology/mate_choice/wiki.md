****** Mate choice ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Mate choice is highly visible in lek_mating. Along with the black_grouse the
males gather in a quagmire and the females then arrive and observe the male
before choosing one.
Mate choice is one of the primary mechanisms under which evolution can occur.
It is characterized by a âselective response by animals to particular
stimuliâ which can be observed as behavior.[1] In other words, before an
animal engages with a potential mate, they first evaluate various aspects of
that mate which are indicative of qualityâsuch as the resources or phenotypes
they haveâand evaluate whether or not those particular trait(s) are somehow
beneficial to them. The evaluation will then incur a response of some sort.[1]
These mechanisms are a part of evolutionary change because they operate in a
way that causes the qualities that are desired in a mate to be more frequently
passed on to each generation over time. For example, if female peacocks desire
mates who have a colourful plumage, then this trait will increase in frequency
over time as male peacocks with a colourful plumage will have more reproductive
success.[2] Further investigation of this concept, has found that it is in fact
the specific trait of blue and green colour near the eyespot that seems to
increase the females likelihood of mating with a specific peacock.[3]
Mate choice is one of two components of sexual_selection, the other being
intrasexual_selection. Ideas on sexual selection were first introduced in 1871,
by Charles_Darwin, then expanded on by Ronald_Fisher in 1915. At present, there
are five sub mechanisms that explain how mate choice has evolved over time.
These are direct phenotypic benefits, sensory bias, the Fisherian_runaway
hypothesis, indicator traits and genetic compatibility.
In the majority of systems where mate choice exists, one sex tends to be
competitive with their same-sex members[4] and the other sex is choosy (meaning
they are selective when it comes to picking individuals to mate with). There
are direct and indirect benefits of being the selective individual.[5][6][7] In
most species, females are the choosy sex which discriminates among competitive
males,[4] but there are several examples of reversed roles (see below). It is
preferable for an individual to choose a compatible mate of the same species,
in order to maintain reproductive success.[8] Other factors that can influence
mate choice include pathogen_stress and the Major_Histocompatibility_Complex
(MHC).

***** Origins and history[edit] *****
Ronald Fisher in 1913
The peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a Fisherian runaway
Charles_Darwin first expressed his ideas on sexual selection and mate choice in
his book The_Descent_of_Man,_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex in 1871. He was
perplexed by the elaborate ornamentation that males of some species have,
because such features appeared to be detrimental to survival and to have
negative consequences for reproductive success. Darwin proposed two
explanations for the existence of such traits: these traits are useful in male-
male combat or they are preferred by females.[9] This article focuses on the
latter. Darwin treated natural selection and sexual selection as two different
topics, although in the 1930s biologists defined sexual selection as being a
part of natural selection.[10]
In 1915, Ronald_Fisher wrote a paper on the evolution of female preference and
secondary_sexual_characteristics.[11] Fifteen years later, he expanded this
theory in a book called The_Genetical_Theory_of_Natural_Selection. There he
described a scenario where feedback between mate preference and a trait results
in elaborate characters such as the long tail of the male peacock (see
Fisherian_runaway).
In 1948, using Drosophila as a model, Angus_John_Bateman presented experimental
evidence that male reproductive_success is limited by the number of mates
obtained, while female reproductive success is limited by the number of
pregnancies that she can have in her lifetime.[12] Thus a female must be
selective when choosing a mate because the quality of her offspring depends on
it. Males must fight, in the form of intra-sexual competition, for the
opportunity to mate because not all males will be chosen by females. This
became known as Bateman's_principle, and although this was a major finding that
added to the work of Darwin and Fisher, it was overlooked until George_C.
Williams emphasised its importance in the 1960s and 1970s.[13][14]
In 1972, soon after Williams' revival of the subject, Robert_L._Trivers
presented his parental_investment theory. Trivers defined parental investment
as any investment made by the parent that benefits his or her current offspring
at the cost of investment in future offspring. These investments include the
costs of producing gametes as well as any other care or efforts that parents
provide after birth or hatching. Reformulating Bateman's ideas, Trivers argued
that the sex which exhibits less parental investment (not necessarily the male)
will have to compete for mating opportunities with the sex that invests more.
The differences in levels of parental investment create the condition that
favours mating biases.[15]
***** Direct and indirect benefits[edit] *****
The act of being choosy was likely selected for as a way to assess whether or
not a potential partnerâs contribution(s) would be capable of producing and/
or maintaining the viability of an offspring. Utilizing these behaviors usually
results in two types of benefits to the individual who is being choosy:
    * Direct benefits increase the fitness of the choosy sex through direct
      material advantages or resources. These benefits include but are not
      limited to increased territory quality, increased parental care, and
      protection from predators. There is much support for maintenance of mate
      choice by direct benefits[5] and this approach offers the least
      controversial model to explain discriminate mating.[6]
    * Indirect benefits increase genetic fitness for the offspring, and thereby
      increase the parents' inclusive_fitness. When it appears that the choosy
      sex does not receive direct benefits from his or her mate, indirect
      benefits may be the payoff for being selective. These indirect benefits
      may include high-quality genes for their offspring (known as adaptive
      indirect benefits) or genes that make their offspring more attractive
      (known as arbitrary indirect benefits).[7]
***** Mechanisms[edit] *****
As of 2018[update] five proposed mechanisms address the evolution of mate
choice:
    * Direct Phenotypic Benefits
    * Sensory Bias
    * Fisherian Runaway
    * Indicator Traits
    * Genetic Compatibility
Direct and/or indirect benefits drive the mating biases described in each
mechanism. It is possible that these mechanisms co-occur, although the relative
roles of each have not been evaluated adequately.[4]
**** Direct phenotypic benefits[edit] ****
A choosy mate tends to have preferences for certain types of traitsâalso
known as phenotypesâwhich would benefit them to have in a potential partner.
These traits must be reliable, and commutative of something that directly
benefits the choosy partner in some way.[16] Having a mating preference is
advantageous in this situation because it directly affects reproductive
fitness. Direct benefits are widespread and empirical studies provide evidence
for this mechanism of evolution.[17][18]
One example of a sexually selected trait with direct benefits is the bright
plumage of the northern_cardinal, a common backyard bird in the eastern United
States. Male northern cardinals have conspicuous red feathers while the females
are more cryptic in coloration. In this example, the females are the choosy sex
and will use male plumage brightness as a signal when picking a mate â males
with brighter plumage have been shown to feed their young more frequently than
males with duller plumage.[19] This increased help in caring for the young
lifts some of the burden from the mother so that she can raise more offspring
than she could without help.
Though this particular mechanism operates on the premise that all phenotypes
must communicate something that benefits the choosy mate directly, they can
still have unintentional indirect benefits to the mom by benefiting the
offspring. For example, with the increased help in feeding their young seen in
Northern Cardinals with more plumage brightness, comes an increase in the
overall amount of food that is likely to be given to the offspring even if the
mother has more children.[20] Though this trait was chosen for by the female to
allow her more time and energy to be allocated to creating more offspring, it
still benefits the offspring in that two parents are now providing food instead
of one, thereby increasing the likelihood of the overall amount of food
available to the offspring despite a possible increase in the amount of
siblings.[20]
**** Sensory bias[edit] ****
See also: Mating_call
The sensory-bias hypothesis states that the preference for a trait evolves in a
non-mating context and is then exploited by the less choosy sex in order to
obtain more mating opportunities. The competitive sex evolves traits that
exploit a pre-existing bias that the choosy sex already possesses. This
mechanism is thought[by_whom?] to explain remarkable trait differences in
closely related species because it produces a divergence in signaling systems
which leads to reproductive_isolation.[21]
Sensory bias has been demonstrated in guppies, freshwater fish from Trinidad
and_Tobago. In this mating system, female guppies prefer to mate with males
with more orange body-coloration. However, outside of a mating context, both
sexes prefer animate orange objects, which suggests that preference originally
evolved in another context, like foraging.[22] Orange fruits are a rare treat
that fall into streams where the guppies live. The ability to find these fruits
quickly is an adaptive quality that has evolved outside of a mating context.
Sometime after the affinity for orange objects arose, male guppies exploited
this preference by incorporating large orange spots to attract females.
Another example of sensory exploitation is the case of the water mite Neumania
papillator, an ambush_predator which hunts copepods (small crustaceans) passing
by in the water column.[23] When hunting, N. papillator adopts a characteristic
stance termed the "net stance": its holds its first four legs out into the
water column, with its four hind legs resting on aquatic vegetation; this
allows it to detect vibrational stimuli produced by swimming prey and to use
this to orient towards and clutch at prey.[24] During courtship, males actively
search for females;[25] if a male finds a female, he slowly circles around the
female whilst trembling his first and second leg near her.[23][24] Male leg-
trembling causes females (who were in the "net stance") to orient towards and
often to clutch the male.[23] This does not damage the male or deter further
courtship; the male then deposits spermatophores and begins to vigorously fan
and jerk his fourth pair of legs over the spermatophore, generating a current
of water that passes over the spermatophores and towards the female.[23] Sperm-
packet uptake by the female would sometimes follow.[23] Heather Proctor
hypothesised that the vibrations made by trembling male legs mimic the
vibrations that females detect from swimming prey. This would trigger the
female prey-detection responses, causing females to orient and then clutch at
males, mediating courtship.[23][26] If this was true and males were exploiting
female predation responses, then hungry females should be more receptive to
male trembling. Proctor found that unfed captive females did orient and clutch
at males significantly more than fed captive females did, consistent with the
sensory exploitation hypothesis.[23]
Other examples of the sensory-bias mechanism include traits in auklets,[27]
wolf_spiders,[28] and manakins.[29] Further experimental work is required to
reach a fuller understanding of the prevalence and mechanisms of sensory bias.

**** Fisherian runaway and sexy-son hypothesis[edit] ****
Main articles: Fisherian_runaway and Sexy_son_hypothesis
This creates a positive feedback loop in which a particular trait is desired by
a female and present in a male, and that desire for and presence of that
particular trait are then reflected in their offspring.[20] If this mechanism
is strong enough, it can lead to a type of self-reinforcing coevolution.[20] If
runaway selection is strong enough, it may incur significant costs, such as
increased visibility to predators and energetic costs to maintain the trait's
full expression. Hence peacocks' extravagant feathers, or any number of lek
mating displays. This model does not predict a genetic benefit; rather, the
reward is more mates.
In a study done on great_reed_warblers, models based on the polygyny threshold
and sexy-son hypotheses predict that females should gain evolutionary advantage
in either short-term or long-term in this mating system. Although the
importance of female choice was demonstrated, the study did not support the
hypotheses.[citation_needed] Other studies, such as those conducted on long-
tailed_widowbirds, have demonstrated the existence of female choice.[citation
needed] Here, females chose males with long tails, and even preferred those
males with experimentally lengthened tails over shortened tails and those of
naturally occurring length. Such a process shows how female choice could give
rise to exaggerated sexual traits through Fisherian runaway selection.
**** Indicator traits[edit] ****

Indicator traits signal good overall quality of the individual. Traits
perceived as attractive must reliably indicate broad genetic quality in order
for selection to favor them and for preference to evolve. This is an example of
indirect genetic benefits received by the choosy sex, because mating with such
individuals will result in high-quality offspring. The indicator traits
hypothesis is split into three highly related subtopics: the handicap theory of
sexual selection, the good genes hypothesis, and the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis.
People rate the importance of certain traits differently when referring to
their own or to others' ideal long-term partners. Research suggests that women
consider traits indicating genetic fitness as more important for their own
partner, while prioritising traits that provide benefits to others for their
sister's ideal partner.[31]
Indicator traits are condition-dependent and have associated costs. Therefore,
individuals which can handle these costs well (cf. "I can do X [here, survive]
with one hand tied behind my back") should be desired by the choosy sex for
their superior genetic quality. This is known as the handicap theory of sexual
selection.[32]
The good genes hypothesis states that the choosy sex will mate with individuals
who possess traits that signify overall genetic quality. In doing so, they gain
an evolutionary advantage for their offspring through indirect benefit.
The Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis posits that sexual ornaments are indicators of
parasite- and disease-resistance.[33] To test this hypothesis, red jungle-fowl
males were infected with a parasitic roundworm and monitored for growth and
developmental changes. Female preference was also evaluated. The researchers
found that parasites affected the development and final appearance of
ornamental traits and that females preferred males who were not infected. This
supports the idea that parasites are an important factor in sexual selection
and mate choice.[34]
One of many examples of indicator traits is the condition-dependent patch of
red feathers around the face and shoulders of the male house finch. This patch
varies in brightness among individuals because the pigments that produce the
red color (carotenoids) are limited in the environment. Thus, males who have a
high-quality diet will have brighter red plumage. In a manipulation experiment,
female house finches were shown to prefer males with brighter red patches.
Also, males with naturally brighter patches proved better fathers and exhibited
higher offspring-feeding rates than duller males.[18] This study is heavily
cited in the literature and it provides solid support for the indicator-traits
hypothesis that is associated with direct benefits.
**** Genetic compatibility[edit] ****
Genetic compatibility refers to how well the genes of two parents function
together in their offspring. Choosing genetically compatible mates could result
in optimally fit offspring and notably affect reproductive fitness. However,
the genetic compatibility model is limited to specific traits due to complex
genetic interactions (e.g. major_histocompatibility_complex in humans and
mice). The choosy sex must know their own genotype as well as the genotypes of
potential mates in order to select the appropriate partner.[35] This makes
testing components of genetic compatibility difficult and controversial.
A controversial but well-known experiment suggests that human females use body
odor as an indicator of genetic compatibility. In this study, males were given
a plain T-shirt to sleep in for two nights in order to provide a scent sample.
College women were then asked to rate odors from several men, some with similar
MHC (major histocompatibility complex) genes to their own and others with
dissimilar genes. MHC genes code for receptors that identify foreign pathogens
in the body so that the immune system may respond and destroy them. Since each
different gene in the MHC codes for a different type of receptor, it is
expected that females will benefit from mating with males who have more
dissimilar MHC genes. This will ensure better resistance to parasites and
disease in offspring. Researchers found that women tended to rate the odors
higher if the male's genes were more dissimilar to their own. They concluded
that the odors are influenced by the MHC and that they have consequences for
mate choice in human populations today.[36]
Similar to the humans of the odor-rating experiment, animals also choose mates
based upon genetic compatibility as determined by evaluating the body odor of
their potential mate(s). Some animals, such as mice, assess a mate's genetic
compatibility based on their urine odor.[37]
In an experiment studying three-spined_sticklebacks, researchers found that
females prefer to mate with males that share a greater diversity of major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and in addition possess a MHC halotype
specific to fighting the common parasite Gyrodactylus_salaris.[38] Mates that
have MHC genes different from one another will be superior when reproducing
with regard to parasite resistance, body condition and reproductive success and
survival.[39]
The genetic diversity of animals and life reproductive success (LRS) at the MHC
level is optimal at intermediate levels rather than at its maximum,[40][41]
despite MHC being one of the most polymorphic genes.[42] In a study,
researchers discovered that mice heterozygous at all MHC loci were less
resistant than mice homozygous at all loci to salmonella, so it appears
disadvantageous to display many different MHC alleles due to the increased loss
of T-cells,[43] which aid an organism's immune system and trigger its
appropriate response.[44]
MHC diversity may also correlate with MHC gene_expression. As long as a
heritable component exists in expression patterns, natural selection is able to
act upon the trait. Therefore, gene expression for MHC genes might contribute
to the natural selection processes of certain species and be in fact
evolutionarily relevant. For example, in another study of three-spined
sticklebacks, exposure to parasite species increased MHC class IIB expression
by over 25%, proving that parasitic infection increases gene expression.[45]
MHC diversity in vertebrates may also be generated by the recombination of
alleles on the MHC gene.[46]
***** Sex role reversal in animals[edit] *****
In species where mating biases exist, females are typically the choosy sex
because they provide a greater parental_investment than males. However, there
are some examples of sex role reversals where females must compete with each
other for mating opportunities with males. Species that exhibit parental care
after the birth of their offspring have the potential to overcome the sex
differences in parental investment (the amount of energy that each parent
contributes per offspring) and lead to a reversal in sex roles.[4] The
following are examples of male mate choice (sex role reversal) across several
taxa.
    * Fish: Male fish typically display high levels of parental care (see
      pipefish, scissortail_sergeant, and seahorses). This is because females
      will deposit their eggs in a special brooding pouch that the male
      possesses. She doesn't participate in parental care after this event. The
      male then has the burden of raising the offspring on his own which
      requires energy and time. Thus, males in these species must choose among
      competitive females for mating opportunities. Surveys across multiple
      species of pipefish suggest that the sex differences in the level of
      parental care may not be the only reason for the reversal. Mating systems
      (e. i. monogamy and polygamy) might also heavily influence the appearance
      of male mate choice.[47]
    * Amphibian: Male poison-arrow_frogs (Dendrobates auratus) take on a very
      active parenting role. Females are lured by the males to rearing sites
      where they deposit their eggs. The male fertilises these eggs and accepts
      the burden of defending and caring for the young until they are
      independent. Because the male contributes a higher level of parental
      investment, females must compete for opportunities to leave their eggs
      with the limited available males.[48]
    * Bird: Bird species are typically biparental in care, and may also be
      maternal like the Guianan_cock-of-the-rocks. However the reverse may also
      hold true. Male wattled_jacanas provide all parental care after the eggs
      have been laid by the females. This means that the males must incubate
      the eggs and defend the nest for an extended period of time. Since males
      invest much more time and energy into the offspring, females are very
      competitive for the right to lay their eggs in an established nest.[49]
    * Mammal: There are no confirmed cases of sex role reversed mammals but
      female spotted_hyenas have peculiar anatomy and behaviour that has
      warranted much attention.[50] Female spotted hyenas are much more
      aggressive than males due to their high levels of androgens during
      development. The increased male hormones during development contribute to
      an enlarged pseudopenis that is involved in mating and birth.[51]
      Although the anatomical and behavioural roles differ from accepted norms,
      spotted hyenas are not sex role reversed because the females do not
      compete with each other for mates.[52]
***** Speciation[edit] *****
For many years it has been suggested that sexual isolation caused by
differences in mating behaviours is a precursor for reproductive isolation
(lack of gene_flow), and consequently speciation, in nature.[53] Mate choice
behaviours are thought to be important forces that can result in speciation
events because the strength of selection for attractive traits is often very
strong. Speciation by this method occurs when a preference for some sexual
trait shifts and produces a pre-zygotic barrier (preventing fertilisation).
These processes have been difficult to test until recently with advances in
genetic modelling.[54] Speciation by sexual selection is gaining popularity in
the literature with increasing theoretical and empirical studies.
There is evidence of early speciation through mate preference in guppies.
Guppies are located across several isolated streams in Trinidad and male colour
patterns differ geographically. Female guppies have no coloration but their
preference for these colour patterns also vary across locations. In a mate
choice study, female guppies were shown to prefer males with colour patterns
that are typical of their home stream.[55] This preference could result in
reproductive isolation if two populations came into contact again. There is a
similar trend shown in two species of the wood white butterfly, L. reali and L.
sinapis. Female L. sinapis controls mate choice by engaging only in conspecific
mating, while males attempt to mate with either species. This female mate
choice has encouraged speciation of the two wood whites.[56]
The black-throated_blue_warbler, a North American bird, is another example.
Asymmetric recognition of local and non-local songs has been found between two
populations of black-throated blue warblers in the United States, one in the
northern United States (New Hampshire) and the other in the southern United
States (North Carolina).[57] Males in the northern population respond strongly
to the local male songs but relatively weakly to the non-local songs of
southern males. In contrast, southern males respond equally to both local and
non-local songs. The fact that northern males exhibit differential recognition
indicates that northern females tend not to mate with "heterospecific" males
from the south; thus it is not necessary for the northern males to respond
strongly to the song from a southern challenger. A barrier to gene flow exists
from South to North as a result of the female choice, which can eventually lead
to speciation.
***** Mate choice in humans[edit] *****
In humans, males and females differ in their strategies to acquire mates and
focus on certain qualities. There are two main categories of strategies that
both sex's utilize: short-term and long-term. Human mate choice depends on a
variety of factors, such as ecology, demography, access to resources, rank/
social standing, genes, and parasite_stress.
While there are a few common mating systems seen among humans, the amount of
variation in mating strategies is relatively large. This is due to how humans
evolved in diverse niches that were geographically and ecologically expansive.
This diversity, as well as cultural practices and human consciousness, have all
led to a large amount of variation in mating systems. Below are some of the
overarching trends of female mate choice.
**** Female mate choice[edit] ****
Although, in humans, both males and females are selective in terms of whom they
decide to mate with, as is seen in nature, females exhibit even more mate
choice selection than males. However, relative to most other animals, female
and male mating strategies are found to be more similar to one another than
they are different. According to Bateman's principle of Lifespan Reproductive
Success (LRS), human females display the least variance of the two sexes in
their LRS due to their high obligatory parental_investment, that is a nine-
month gestational period, as well as lactation following birth in order to feed
offspring so that their brain can grow to the required size.[58]
Human female sexual selection can be examined by looking at ways in which males
and females are sexually dimorphic, especially in traits that serve little
other evolutionary purpose. For example, male traits such as the presence of
beards, overall lower voice pitch, and average greater height are thought to be
sexually selected traits as they confer benefits to either the women selecting
for them, or to their offspring. Experimentally, women have reported a
preference for men with beards and lower voices.[59][60]
Female mate choice hinges on many different coinciding male traits, and the
trade-off between many of these traits must be assessed. The ultimate traits
most salient to female human mate choice, however, are parental investment,
resource provision and the provision of good genes to offspring. Many
phenotypic traits are thought to be selected for as they act as an indication
of one of these three major traits. The relative importance of these traits
when considering mate selection differ depending on the type of mating
arrangement females engage in. Human women typically employ long-term mating
strategies when choosing a mate, however they also engage in short-term mating
arrangements, so their mate choice preferences change depending on the function
of the type of arrangement.[61]
The type of mating strategy that females choose to engage in is also influenced
by the type of environment or culture they are surrounded by. For example, in a
patriarchal society where wealth and social status are inherited through the
male lineage, monogamy is often practiced to assure certainty of paternal
lineage. On the other hand, matriarchal societies often followed multiple
mating and female cooperative breeding systems. Other environmental factors
which influence mating strategies include access to available resources and
risk/need for protection.[citation_needed]
*** Short-term mating strategies[edit] ***
Women do not always seek out and engage in long-term mating arrangements. This
is evidenced by factors such as the evolved male tendency to seek out multiple
sexual partners â a trait that could not have evolved if women were not also
historically engaging in short-term arrangements[62] â and by the tendency of
some women to pursue affairs outside of their long-term couple pairings.
David_Buss outlines several hypotheses as to the function of women's short-term
mate choices:
    * Resource hypothesis: Women may engage in short-term mating in order to
      gain resources that they may not be able to gain from a long-term
      partner, or that a long-term partner may not be able to provide
      consistently. These resources may be food, protection for the woman and
      her children from aggressive men who may capture or sexually coerce them,
      or status, by providing the woman with a higher social standing. Women
      may also benefit from having several short-term mating arrangements
      through paternity confusion â if the paternity of her offspring is not
      certain, she may be able to accrue resources from several men as a result
      of this uncertainty.[61]
    * Genetic benefit hypothesis: Women may choose to engage in short-term
      mating arrangements in order to aid conception if her long-term partner
      is infertile, to gain superior genes to those of her long-term partner,
      or to acquire different genes to those of her partner and increase the
      genetic diversity of her offspring. This relates to what is known as the
      sexy_son_hypothesis; if a woman acquires genes from a high quality male,
      her offspring will likely have higher mate value, resulting in their
      increased reproductive success.[61]
    * Mate expulsion and mate switching: Women may engage in a short-term
      mating arrangement in order to cause her long-term partner to end their
      relationship; in other words, to facilitate a break-up. Women may also
      use short-term mating if their current partner has depreciated in value,
      and they wish to 'trade-up' and find a partner that they believe has
      higher value.[61]
    * Short-term for long-term goals: Women may use short-term sexual
      relationships in order to assess a mate's value as a long-term partner,
      or in the hopes that the short-term arrangement will result in one that
      is long-term.[61]
*** Long-term mating strategies[edit] ***
While there has been evidence and research to support the existence of short
term mating in women, it has nevertheless been shown that women prefer long
term partners over short term mates. This preference is due to women's tendency
to invest and require more energy for parental care. In long-term mating
arrangements, women typically look for males who will provide a high level of
parental investment, and who can provide resources to the woman or to her
offspring.[citation_needed] The provision of economic resources, or the
potential to acquire many economic resources is the most obvious cue towards
the ability of a man to provide resources, and women in the United States have
been shown experimentally to rate the importance of their partner's financial
status more highly than men.[61] However, many other traits exist that may act
as cues towards a man's ability to provide resources that have been sexually
selected for in women's evolutionary history. These include older age â older
males have had more time to accrue resources â industriousness, dependability
and stability â if a woman's long-term partner is not emotionally stable or
is not dependable then their provision of resources to her and her offspring
are likely to be inconsistent. Additionally, the costs associated with an
emotionally unstable partner such as jealousy and manipulation may outweigh the
benefits associated with the resources they are able to provide.[61]
Women's mate choice is not as straightforward as selecting a mate that displays
all of her desired qualities. Often, potential mates will possess some
qualities that are desirable and some that are not, so women must assess the
relative costs and benefits of their potential partners' traits and 'trade
off'. Women's mate choices will also be constrained by the context in which
they are making them, resulting in conditional mate choices.[58] Some of the
conditions that may influence female mate choice include the woman's own
perceived attractiveness, the woman's personal resources, mate copying and
parasite stress.[61]
**** Male mate choice[edit] ****
Generally, it is unusual for males within a species to be the choosy sex. There
are many reasons for this. In humans, following sexual_reproduction, the female
is obliged to endure a nine-month pregnancy and childbirth.[61] This means that
females naturally provide a greater parental_investment to offspring, than
males.[61][63] Human males have a larger quantity of gametes than females,
which are replenished at a rate of approximately 12 million per hour.
Conversely, female humans are born with a fixed amount of egg cells which are
not restocked over the lifespan.[61] This provides males with a greater window
of opportunity to mate and reproduce than females, hence females are usually
more choosy.
Despite not being the typically choosy gender, human males can be influenced by
certain traits of females when making decisions about a potential mate:[63]
*** Short-term mating strategies[edit] ***
When finding a short-term mate, males highly value women with sexual experience
and physical attractiveness.[64] Men seeking short-term sexual relationships
are likely to avoid women who are interested in commitment or require
investment.
Examples of short-term mating strategies in males:
    * Multiple sexual partners: When looking for short-term sexual
      relationships, men may wish for there to be as little time as possible
      between each partner.[64] When engaging in sexual intercourse with
      multiple partners, it is important to be aware that the risk of
      contracting a sexually transmitted disease may increase if contraception
      is not used.
    * Physical attractiveness: Men who are interested in a short-term sexual
      relationship are more likely to prioritise information about the body of
      potential partners, rather than their faces.[64] When finding a female
      for a short-term relationship, compared with a long-term relationship,
      males are less likely to prioritise factors such as commitment.
    * Relaxation of standards: It has been reported that men are more likely to
      engage in a sexual relationship with women who have lower levels of
      intelligence, independence, honesty, generosity, athleticism,
      responsibility and cooperativeness, when this relationship is short-term.
      [64] Men may be more accepting of lower standards, than what they usually
      prefer, because they are not entering a long-term relationship with this
      person.
    * Sexual experience: Many men assume that women who have engaged in sexual
      experiences beforehand are likely to have a higher sex drive than women
      who haven't.[64] These women may also be more accessible and require less
      courtship.
*** Long-term mating strategies[edit] ***
Although from an evolutionary perspective women are usually the choosy sex, if
a human male has the desire to reproduce he may seek certain qualities in a
potential mate who could be the mother of his offspring. Humans have the
ability to rely on biological_signals of reproductive success and non-
biological signals, such as the female's willingness to marry.[65] Unlike many
animals, humans are not able to consciously display physical changes to their
body when they are ready to mate, so they have to rely on other forms of
communication before engaging in a consensual relationship.
Males may look for:
    * Commitment and marriage: A human male may be interested in mating with a
      female who seeks marriage.[65] This is because he has exclusive sexual
      access to the female, so any offspring produced in the relationship will
      be genetically related to him (unless the female has sexual intercourse
      with another male outside of the marriage). This increases the likelihood
      of paternity_certainty. With two married parents investing in the
      offspring, their chance of survival may increase; therefore the male's
      DNA will be passed on to the children of his offspring. Also, a male who
      is interested in committing to a female may be more attractive to
      potential mates. A male who can promise resources and future parental
      investment is likely to be more appealing to women than a male who is
      unwilling to commit to her.
    * Facial_symmetry: Symmetrical faces have been judged to signal good
      general health and the ability for a woman to withstand adverse
      environmental factors, such as illness.[65]
    * Femininity: A feminine face can be a signal of youth, which in turn
      signals strong reproductive value.[65] As a woman gets older, her facial
      features become less feminine due to ageing. Femininity can also be
      linked to disease-resistance and high estrogen levels, which are factors
      that suggest reproductive value to a potential mate.
    * Physical beauty: Observable characteristics of a woman can indicate good
      health and the ability to reproduce, qualities which are likely to be
      desired by a male. This may include smooth skin, absence of lesions,
      muscle tone, long hair and high energy levels.[65]
    * Resources: Men who are looking for a long-term partner may strive to
      achieve a high status or resources, such as their own home or a job
      promotion.[65] This may increase their chance of attracting a desirable
      mate.
    * Waist-to-hip_ratio: A waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 is an indicator of
      fertility, lower long-term health risks and suggests that the woman isn't
      already pregnant.[65] A male is likely to desire these qualities in a
      mate, as it will increase the chance of survival of any offspring the
      couple have together.
    * Breasts: Men typically prefer women who have larger breasts because it is
      a sign of being 20â24 years of age. A woman in this age range is
      perceived to be more fertile, sexually mature, and reproductively
      healthy. Larger breasts are also an indicator of having a higher body fat
      percentage which secures more energy to provide nutrients to the fetus
      during gestation as well as increase the productivity of lactation.
      Although breast size is of importance to male attraction because it is
      very prominent, areola pigment is also found to be significant. As women
      age and take part in more pregnancies, their areolae become darker in
      pigment. Therefore, darker areolae are seen to be more attractive as they
      indicate that the woman is capable of successfully birthing healthy
      children. This is however only seen to be attractive in women with larger
      breasts. If a woman has breasts that are small or medium sized, a lighter
      areola is preferred by men because the areola lightens as a woman goes
      through puberty. This way, she is still seen to be fertile, she just may
      not be assumed to be as sexually mature and reproductively healthy as a
      woman with larger breasts and darker areolae.[66]
    * Youth: Both young and old men are attracted to women in their twenties.
      [67][68] Faces that appear younger are usually rated as more attractive
      by males.[65] This could include faces with clear skin and a lack of
      wrinkles as well as whiter eyes and redder cheeks and lips[69] A female
      who appears younger is likely to be appealing to mates, as it suggests
      that she has a higher reproductive value than alternative, older,
      females. As a woman passes her twentieth birthday, her reproductive value
      declines steadily until around the age of fifty.
***** Parasite Stress on Mate Choice[edit] *****
The parasite-stress_theory, otherwise known as pathogen stress, states that
parasites or diseases, stress the development of organisms, leading to a change
in the appearance of their sexually attractive traits. In societies with a high
prevalence of parasites or pathogens greater evolutionary advantage is derived
from selecting for physical attractiveness/good looks of their potential mates,
by the members of that society, compared to members of societies with a lower
prevalence of parasites or diseases who put less emphasis on physical
attractiveness. It indicates that physical attractiveness serves as a method by
which humans can determine resistance to parasites, as it's believed that
parasites and diseases would lower the ability to portray attractive traits of
those who are suffering or have suffered from a disease, and would also limit
the number of high-quality pathogen-resistant mates.[70]
**** Hamilton-Zuk Hypothesis[edit] ****
The Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis[71] (see Indicator_traits) has greatly influenced
research regarding human mate choice. The initial research showed that, within
one species (brightly colored birds), there was greater sexual selection for
males that had brighter plumage (feathers). In addition, Hamilton and Zuk
showed that, between multiple species, there is greater selection for physical
attributes in species under greater parasitic stress. In cultures where
parasitic infection is especially high, members of that society use cues
available to them to determine the physical health status of the potential
mate.[72] Regardless of the wealth or ideology, the females in areas of a
society that are more at risk or have higher rates of parasites and diseases
will rate masculinity as a higher priority.
*** Hamilton-Zuk Hypothesis in Humans[edit] ***
    * Scarification: In pre-industrial societies, body markings such as tattoos
      or scarifications are predicted to have been a way in which individuals
      could attract potential mates, by indicating the reproductive quality of
      a person. Meaning, scars on the body could be viewed by prospective mates
      as evidence that a person has overcome parasites and is thus more
      attractive to potential mates.[73] Research investigating this hypothesis
      (Singh and Bronstad 1997), found that in instances of increased pathogen
      prevalence, the only anatomical area with evidence of scarification in
      females was found on the stomach, with no evidence found for male
      scarification.[74]
    * Masculinity: In societies where there are high levels of parasites or
      diseases, the females of that society, as the overall health of its
      members decreases, increasingly start to place more emphasis on
      masculinity in their mate preference.[75] In particular, women look for
      increasing signs of masculinity in areas such as the voice, face and body
      shape of males.[76] The face, in particular, may hold several cues for
      parasitic resistance[77] and has been the subject of most attractiveness
      research.[78]
    * Polygamy: Tropical areas were originally associated with polygynous
      societies and this was a result of the surrounding environment being both
      ecologically richer and homogenous.[79] However, whilst tropical areas
      were associated with Polygamy, pathogen stress, is regarded as a better
      indicator of polygamy and has been positively correlated with it.
      Furthermore, over the course of human evolution, areas which had high
      levels of parasite-stress may have shifted the polygamy threshold and
      increased the presence of certain types of polygamy in a society.[80]
**** Criticisms[edit] ****
Gangested and Buss (2009) say that research indicates that parasite stress may
have only influenced mate choice through females searching for "good genes"
which show parasite resistance, in areas which have high prevalence of
parasites.[81] John Cartwright also points out that females may be simply
avoiding the transmission of parasites to themselves rather than it being them
choosing males with good genes and that females look for more than just
parasite-resistant genes.[72]
***** MHC-Correlated Mate Choice[edit] *****
Major_Histocompatibility_Complex (MHC) or in humans, Human_Leukocyte_Antigen
(HLA), produces proteins that are essential for immune system functioning. The
genes of the MHC complex have extremely high variability, assumed to be a
result of frequency-dependent parasite-driven selection and mate choice. This
is believed to be so it promotes heterozygosity improving the chances of
survival for the offspring.
**** Odour preferences[edit] ****
In experiments using rats, MHC-associated mate choice indicated that odor cues
played a role.[82] In humans, there is conflicting evidence about whether men
and women will rate the opposite genders odor as more pleasant, if the
potential mate has MHC-dissimilar antigens to them.[83] However, women on
contraceptive pills rate the odour of MHC-similar men as being more pleasant,
it is unknown why women on contraceptive pills rate smell in this way. It was
found that when processing MHC-similar smells were processed faster.[84]
Contrary to these findings, other studies have found that there is no
correlation between attraction and odor by testing males' odor preferences on
women's odors. The study concludes that there is no correlation in attraction
between men and women of dissimilar HLA proteins.[85] Research completed on a
Southern Brazilian student population resulted in similar findings that found
significant differences in the attraction ratings of giving to male sweat and
MHC-difference.[86]
**** Facial preferences[edit] ****
Human facial preferences have been shown to correlate with both MHC-similarity
and MHC-heterozygosity.[87] Research into MHC-similarity with regards to facial
attractiveness is limited but research so far suggests that women, when
thinking of long-term relationships, will choose males who are MHC-similar.[88]
While facial_asymmetry hasn't been correlated with MHC-heterozygosity, the
perceived healthiness of skin appears to be.[89] It appears to be that only
MHC-heterozygosity and no other genetic markers are correlated with facial
attractiveness in males[90] and it has been shown that so far that there is no
correlation that has been found in females.[91][92] Slightly different from
facial attractiveness, facial masculinity is not shown to correlate with MHC
heterogeneity (a common measure of immunocompetence).[93]
**** Criticisms[edit] ****
A review article published in June 2018 concluded that there is no correlation
between HLA and mate choice.[94] In addition to assessing previous studies on
HLA-Mate choice analysis to identify errors in their research methods(such as
small population sizes), the study collects a larger set of data and re-runs
the analysis of the previous studies. By using the larger data set to conduct
analysis on 30 couples of European descent, they generate findings contrary to
previous studies that identified significant divergence in the mate choice with
accordance to HLA genotyping. Additional studies have been conducted
simultaneously on African and European populations that only show correlation
of MHC divergence in European but not African populations.[95]
