In biology, adaptation has three related meanings. Firstly, it is the dynamic
evolutionary process that fits organisms to their environment, enhancing their
evolutionary_fitness. Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during
that process. Thirdly, it is a phenotypic_trait or adaptive trait, with a
functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has evolved
through natural_selection.
Organisms face a succession of environmental challenges as they grow, and show
adaptive plasticity as traits develop in response to the imposed conditions.
This gives them resilience to varying environments.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_evolutionary_thought
Adaptation is an observable fact of life accepted by philosophers and natural
historians from ancient times, independently of their views on evolution, but
their explanations differed. Empedocles did not believe that adaptation
required a final_cause (~ purpose), but thought that it "came about naturally,
since such things survived." Aristotle did believe in final causes, but assumed
that species_were_fixed.[1]
The second of Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck's two factors (the first being a
complexifying force) was an adaptive force that causes animals with a given
body_plan to adapt to circumstances by inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics,
creating a diversity of species and genera.
In natural_theology, adaptation was interpreted as the work of a deity and as
evidence for the existence of God.[2] William_Paley believed that organisms
were perfectly adapted to the lives they led, an argument that shadowed
Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz, who had argued that God had brought about "the_best
of_all_possible_worlds." Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss[3] is a parody of this
optimistic idea, and David_Hume also argued against design.[4] The Bridgewater
Treatises are a product of natural theology, though some of the authors managed
to present their work in a fairly neutral manner. The series was lampooned by
Robert_Knox, who held quasi-evolutionary views, as the Bilgewater Treatises.
Charles_Darwin broke with the tradition by emphasising the flaws and
limitations which occurred in the animal and plant worlds.[5]
Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck proposed a tendency for organisms to become more complex,
moving up a ladder of progress, plus "the influence of circumstances," usually
expressed as use and disuse.[6] This second, subsidiary element of his theory
is what is now called Lamarckism, a proto-evolutionary hypothesis of the
inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics, intended to explain adaptations by
natural means.[7]
Other natural historians, such as Buffon, accepted adaptation, and some also
accepted evolution, without voicing their opinions as to the mechanism. This
illustrates the real merit of Darwin and Alfred_Russel_Wallace, and secondary
figures such as Henry_Walter_Bates, for putting forward a mechanism whose
significance had only been glimpsed previously. A century later, experimental
field studies and breeding experiments by people such as E._B._Ford and
Theodosius_Dobzhansky produced evidence_that_natural_selection was not only the
'engine' behind adaptation, but was a much stronger force than had previously
been thought.[8][9][10]
***** General principles[edit] *****
     The significance of an adaptation can only be understood in relation
     to the total biology of the species.
     â Julian_Huxley, Evolution:_The_Modern_Synthesis[11]
**** What adaptation is[edit] ****
Adaptation is primarily a process rather than a physical form or part of a
body.[12] An internal parasite (such as a liver_fluke) can illustrate the
distinction: such a parasite may have a very simple bodily structure, but
nevertheless the organism is highly adapted to its specific environment. From
this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such
parasites critical adaptations take place in the life_cycle, which is often
quite complex.[13] However, as a practical term, "adaptation" often refers to a
product: those features of a species which result from the process. Many
aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there
are always some features whose function remains in doubt. By using the term
adaptation for the evolutionary process, and adaptive trait for the bodily part
or function (the product), one may distinguish the two different senses of the
word.[14][15][16][17]
Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the observed diversity
of species, such as the different species of Darwin's_finches. The other
process is speciation, in which new species arise, typically through
reproductive_isolation.[18][19] A favourite example used today to study the
interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in
African lakes, where the question of reproductive isolation is complex.[20][21]
Adaptation is not always a simple matter where the ideal phenotype evolves for
a given external environment. An organism must be viable at all stages of its
development and at all stages of its evolution. This places constraints on the
evolution of development, behaviour, and structure of organisms. The main
constraint, over which there has been much debate, is the requirement that each
genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small,
because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. However, it is
not clear what "relatively small" should mean, for example polyploidy in plants
is a reasonably common large genetic change.[22] The origin of eukaryotic
endosymbiosis is a more dramatic example.[23]
All adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological_niches.[24] The
adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. Structural
adaptations are physical features of an organism, such as shape, body covering,
armament, and internal_organization. Behavioural adaptations are inherited
systems of behaviour, whether inherited in detail as instincts, or as a
neuropsychological capacity for learning. Examples include searching_for_food,
mating, and vocalizations. Physiological adaptations permit the organism to
perform special functions such as making venom, secreting slime, and
phototropism), but also involve more general functions such as growth_and
development, temperature_regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of
homeostasis. Adaptation affects all aspects of the life of an organism.
The following definitions are given by the evolutionary biologist Theodosius
Dobzhansky:
      1. Adaptation is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes
      better able to live in its habitat or habitats.[25][26][27]
      2. Adaptedness is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an
      organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.[28]
      3. An adaptive trait is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the
      organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism
      surviving and reproducing.[29]
**** What adaptation is not[edit] ****
Some generalists, such as birds, have the flexibility to adapt to urban_areas.
Adaptation differs from flexibility, acclimatization, and learning. Flexibility
deals with the relative capacity of an organism to maintain itself in different
habitats: its degree of specialization. Acclimatization describes automatic
physiological adjustments during life;[30] learning means improvement in
behavioral performance during life.[31] These terms are preferred to adaptation
for changes during life which are not inherited by the next generation.
Flexibility stems from phenotypic_plasticity, the ability of an organism with a
given genotype to change its phenotype in response to changes in its habitat,
or to move to a different habitat.[32][33] The degree of flexibility is
inherited, and varies between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant
lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot
survive if its needs are not met. Many herbivores are like this; extreme
examples are koalas which depend on Eucalyptus, and giant_pandas which require
bamboo. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive
in many different conditions. Examples are humans, rats, crabs and many
carnivores. The tendency to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is
inheritedâit is an adaptation. Rather different is developmental flexibility:
"An animal or plant is developmentally flexible if when it is raised in or
transferred to new conditions, it changes in structure so that it is better
fitted to survive in the new environment," writes evolutionary_biologist John
Maynard_Smith.[34]
If humans move to a higher altitude, respiration and physical exertion become a
problem, but after spending time in high altitude conditions they acclimatize
to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen, such as by producing more red_blood
cells. The ability to acclimatize is an adaptation, but the acclimatization
itself is not. Fecundity goes down, but deaths from some tropical diseases also
go down. Over a longer period of time, some people are better able to reproduce
at high altitudes than others. They contribute more heavily to later
generations, and gradually by natural selection the whole population becomes
adapted to the new conditions. This has demonstrably occurred, as the observed
performance of long-term communities at higher altitude is significantly better
than the performance of new arrivals, even when the new arrivals have had time
to acclimatize.[35]
**** Adaptedness and fitness[edit] ****
In this sketch of a fitness_landscape, a population can evolve by following the
arrows to the adaptive peak at point B, and the points A and C are local optima
where a population could become trapped.
Main articles: Fitness_(biology) and Fitness_landscape
There is a relationship between adaptedness and the concept of fitness used in
population_genetics. Differences in fitness between genotypes predict the rate
of evolution by natural selection. Natural selection changes the relative
frequencies of alternative phenotypes, insofar as they are heritable.[36]
However, a phenotype with high adaptedness may not have high fitness.
Dobzhansky mentioned the example of the Californian_redwood, which is highly
adapted, but a relict species in danger of extinction.[25] Elliott_Sober
commented that adaptation was a retrospective concept since it implied
something about the history of a trait, whereas fitness predicts a trait's
future.[37]
      1. Relative fitness. The average contribution to the next generation by a
      genotype or a class of genotypes, relative to the contributions of other
      genotypes in the population.[38] This is also known as Darwinian fitness,
      selection_coefficient, and other terms.
      2. Absolute fitness. The absolute contribution to the next generation by
      a genotype or a class of genotypes. Also known as the Malthusian
      parameter when applied to the population as a whole.[36][39]
      3. Adaptedness. The extent to which a phenotype fits its local ecological
      niche. Researchers can sometimes test this through a reciprocal
      transplant.[40]
Sewall_Wright proposed that populations occupy adaptive peaks on a fitness
landscape. To evolve to another, higher peak, a population would first have to
pass through a valley of maladaptive intermediate stages, and might be
"trapped" on a peak that is not optimally adapted.[41]
**** Genetic basis[edit] ****
A large diversity of genome DNAs in a species is the basis for adaptation and
differentiation. A large population is needed to carry sufficient diversity.
According to the misrepair-accumulation aging theory,[42][43] The misrepair
mechanism is important in maintaining a sufficient number of individuals in a
species.[44] misrepair is a way of repair for increasing the surviving chance
of an organism when it has severe injuries. Without misrepairs, no individual
could survive to reproduction age. Thus misrepair mechanism is an essential
mechanism for the survival of a species and for maintaining the number of
individuals. Although individuals die from aging, genome DNAs are being
recopied and transmitted by individuals generation by generation. In addition,
the DNA misrepairs in germ cells contribute also to the diversity of genome
DNAs.
***** Types[edit] *****
     Adaptation is the heart and soul of evolution.
     â Niles_Eldredge, Reinventing Darwin: The Great Debate at the High
     Table of Evolutionary Theory[45]
**** Changes in habitat[edit] ****
Before Darwin, adaptation was seen as a fixed relationship between an organism
and its habitat. It was not appreciated that as the climate changed, so did the
habitat; and as the habitat changed, so did the biota. Also, habitats are
subject to changes in their biota: for example, invasions of species from other
areas. The relative numbers of species in a given habitat are always changing.
Change is the rule, though much depends on the speed and degree of the change.
When the habitat changes, three main things may happen to a resident
population: habitat tracking, genetic change or extinction. In fact, all three
things may occur in sequence. Of these three effects only genetic change brings
about adaptation. When a habitat changes, the resident population typically
moves to more suitable places; this is the typical response of flying insects
or oceanic organisms, which have wide (though not unlimited) opportunity for
movement.[46] This common response is called habitat tracking. It is one
explanation put forward for the periods of apparent stasis in the fossil_record
(the punctuated_equilibrium theory).[47]
**** Genetic change[edit] ****
Genetic change occurs in a population when natural selection and mutations act
on its genetic_variability.[48] The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism
may have been parts of purine_nucleotide_metabolism, with previous metabolic
pathways being part of the ancient RNA_world. By this means, the population
adapts genetically to its circumstances.[10] Genetic changes may result in
visible structures, or may adjust physiological activity in a way that suits
the habitat.
Habitats and biota do frequently change. Therefore, it follows that the process
of adaptation is never finally complete.[49] Over time, it may happen that the
environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings
better and better. On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the
environment occur relatively rapidly, and then the species becomes less and
less well adapted. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic tracking process,
which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population
cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic
change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough
to bring a population back from the brink of extinction in a process called
evolutionary_rescue. Adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a
particular ecosystem.[50][51]
Leigh_Van_Valen thought that even in a stable environment, competing species
constantly had to adapt to maintain their relative standing. This became known
as the Red_Queen_hypothesis, as seen in host-parasite interaction.[52]
**** Co-adaptation[edit] ****
Main article: Co-adaptation
Pollinating insects are co-adapted with flowering plants.
In coevolution, where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the
life of another species, new or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one
species are often followed by the appearance and spread of corresponding
features in the other species. These co-adaptational relationships are
intrinsically dynamic, and may continue on a trajectory for millions of years,
as has occurred in the relationship between flowering_plants and pollinating
insects.[53][54]
**** Mimicry[edit] ****
Main article: Mimicry
A and B show real wasps; the rest are Batesian_mimics: three hoverflies and one
beetle.
Bates' work on Amazonian butterflies led him to develop the first scientific
account of mimicry, especially the kind of mimicry which bears his name:
Batesian_mimicry.[55] This is the mimicry by a palatable species of an
unpalatable or noxious species, gaining a selective advantage. A common example
seen in temperate gardens is the hoverfly, many of whichâthough bearing no
stingâmimic the warning coloration of hymenoptera (wasps and bees). Such
mimicry does not need to be perfect to improve the survival of the palatable
species.[56]
Bates, Wallace and Fritz_MÃ¼ller believed that Batesian and MÃ¼llerian_mimicry
provided evidence_for_the_action_of_natural_selection, a view which is now
standard amongst biologists.[57][58][59]
**** Trade-offs[edit] ****
     It is a profound truth that Nature does not know best; that genetical
     evolution... is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and blunder.
     â Peter_Medawar, The Future of Man[60]
All adaptations have a downside: horse legs are great for running on grass, but
they can't scratch their backs; mammals' hair helps temperature, but offers a
niche for ectoparasites; the only flying penguins do is under water.
Adaptations serving different functions may be mutually destructive. Compromise
and makeshift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in
different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of
compromise.[61]
     Since the phenotype as a whole is the target of selection, it is
     impossible to improve simultaneously all aspects of the phenotype to
     the same degree.
     â Ernst_Mayr, The_Growth_of_Biological_Thought:_Diversity,
     Evolution,_and_Inheritance[62]
Consider the antlers of the Irish_elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in
deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously,
antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories
in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during
the last_glacial_period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of
reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time.[63] As
another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid
coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is
counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.[64]
Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian_salamander or Gold-striped
salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the
banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their
larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk
of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also
negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire_salamander, less
perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more
successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range.[65]
An Indian_peacock's train
in full display
The peacock's ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a
famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely
conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources. Darwin's explanation of its
advantage was in terms of sexual_selection: "This depends on the advantage
which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and
species, in exclusive relation to reproduction."[66] The kind of sexual
selection represented by the peacock is called 'mate choice,' with an
implication that the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has
survival value.[67] The recognition of sexual selection was for a long time in
abeyance, but has been rehabilitated.[68]
The conflict between the size of the human foetal brain at birth, (which cannot
be larger than about 400 cm3, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis)
and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400 cm3), means the brain of a
newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life
(locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That
is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our
upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably
for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.[69][70][71]
As another example, the long neck of a giraffe is a burden and a blessing. The
neck of a giraffe can be up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length.[72] This neck can be
used for inter-species competition or for foraging on tall trees where shorter
herbivores cannot reach. However, as previously stated, there is always a
trade-off. This long neck is heavy and it adds to the body mass of a giraffe,
so the giraffe needs an abundance of nutrition to provide for this costly
adaptation.[73]
***** Shifts in function[edit] *****
     Adaptation and function are two aspects of one problem.
     â Julian Huxley, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis[74]
**** Pre-adaptation[edit] ****
Pre-adaptation occurs when a population has characteristics which by chance are
suited for a set of conditions not previously experienced. For example, the
polyploid cordgrass Spartina townsendii is better adapted than either of its
parent species to their own habitat of saline marsh and mud-flats.[75] Among
domestic animals, the White_Leghorn chicken is markedly more resistant to
vitamin_B1 deficiency than other breeds; on a plentiful diet this makes no
difference, but on a restricted diet this preadaptation could be decisive.[76]
Pre-adaptation may arise because a natural population carries a huge quantity
of genetic variability.[77] In diploid eukaryotes, this is a consequence of the
system of sexual_reproduction, where mutant alleles get partially shielded, for
example, by genetic_dominance.[78] Microorganisms, with their huge populations,
also carry a great deal of genetic variability. The first experimental evidence
of the pre-adaptive nature of genetic variants in microorganisms was provided
by Salvador_Luria and Max_DelbrÃ¼ck who developed the Fluctuation_Test, a
method to show the random fluctuation of pre-existing genetic changes that
conferred resistance to bacteriophages in Escherichia_coli.[79]
**** Co-option of existing traits: exaptation[edit] ****
The feathers of Sinosauropteryx, a dinosaur with feathers, were used for
insulation, making them an exaptation for flight.
Main article: Exaptation
Features that now appear as adaptations sometimes arose by co-option of
existing traits, evolved for some other purpose. The classic example is the ear
ossicles_of_mammals, which we know from paleontological and embryological
evidence originated in the upper and lower jaws and the hyoid_bone of their
synapsid ancestors, and further back still were part of the gill_arches of
early fish.[80][81] The word exaptation was coined to cover these common
evolutionary shifts in function.[82] The flight feathers of birds evolved from
the much earlier feathers_of_dinosaurs,[83] which might have been used for
insulation or for display.[84][85]
***** Non-adaptive traits[edit] *****
Main articles: Spandrel_(biology) and Vestigiality
Some traits do not appear to be adaptive, that is, they have a neutral or
deleterious effect on fitness in the current environment. Because genes have
pleiotropic effects, not all traits may be functional: they may be what Stephen
Jay_Gould and Richard_Lewontin called spandrels, features brought about by
neighbouring adaptations, like the triangular areas under neighbouring arches
in architecture which began as functionless features.[86][clarification_needed]
Another possibility is that a trait may have been adaptive at some point in an
organism's evolutionary history, but a change in habitats caused what used to
be an adaptation to become unnecessary or even maladapted. Such adaptations are
termed vestigial. Many organisms have vestigial organs, which are the remnants
of fully functional structures in their ancestors. As a result of changes in
lifestyle the organs became redundant, and are either not functional or reduced
in functionality. Since any structure represents some kind of cost to the
general economy of the body, an advantage may accrue from their elimination
once they are not functional. Examples: wisdom_teeth in humans; the loss of
pigment and functional eyes in cave fauna; the loss of structure in
endoparasites.[87]
***** Extinction and coextinction[edit] *****
Main articles: Extinction and Coextinction
If a population cannot move or change sufficiently to preserve its long-term
viability, then obviously, it will become extinct, at least in that locale. The
species may or may not survive in other locales. Species extinction occurs when
the death rate over the entire species exceeds the birth rate for a long enough
period for the species to disappear. It was an observation of Van Valen that
groups of species tend to have a characteristic and fairly regular rate of
extinction.[88]
Just as there is co-adaptation, there is also coextinction, the loss of a
species due to the extinction of another with which it is coadapted, as with
the extinction of a parasitic insect following the loss of its host, or when a
flowering plant loses its pollinator, or when a food_chain is disrupted.[89]
[90]
***** Philosophical issues[edit] *****
Main articles: Adaptationism and Teleology_in_biology
Adaptation raises philosophical_issues concerning how biologists speak of
function and purpose, as this carries implications of evolutionary history â
that a feature evolved by natural selection for a specific reason â and
potentially of supernatural intervention â that features and organisms exist
because of a deity's conscious intentions.[91][92] In_his_biology,_Aristotle
introduced teleology to describe the adaptedness of organisms, but without
accepting the supernatural intention built into Plato's thinking, which
Aristotle rejected.[93][94] Modern biologists continue to face the same
difficulty.[95][96][97][98][99][100] On the one hand, adaptation is obviously
purposeful: natural selection chooses what works and eliminates what does not.
On the other hand, biologists want to deny conscious purpose in evolution. The
dilemma gave rise to a famous joke by the evolutionary biologist Haldane:
"Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but
he's unwilling to be seen with her in public.'" David_Hull commented that
Haldane's mistress "has become a lawfully wedded wife. Biologists no longer
feel obligated to apologize for their use of teleological language; they flaunt
it."[101]
