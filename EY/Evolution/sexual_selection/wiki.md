Sexual selection is a form of natural selection where one sex prefers a
specific characteristic in an individual of the other sex. Peafowls exhibit
sexual selection in that peahens look for peacocks with more "eyes" on their
tail feathers. This results in the peacocks with more eyes reproducing more,
leading to peacocks with more eyes becoming more common in subsequent
generations.
Sexual selection is a mode of natural_selection in which members of one
biological_sex choose_mates of the other sex to mate with (intersexual
selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of
the opposite sex (intrasexual selection). These two forms of selection mean
that some individuals have better reproductive_success than others within a
population, either because they are more attractive or prefer more attractive
partners to produce offspring.[1][2] For instance, in the breeding season,
sexual_selection_in_frogs occurs with the males first gathering at the water's
edge and making their mating_calls: croaking. The females then arrive and
choose the males with the deepest croaks and best territories. In general,
males benefit from frequent mating and monopolizing access to a group of
fertile females. Females can have a limited number of offspring and maximize
the return on the energy they invest in reproduction.
The concept was first articulated by Charles_Darwin and Alfred_Russel_Wallace
who described it as driving species adaptations and that many organisms had
evolved features whose function was deleterious to their individual survival,
[3] and then developed by Ronald_Fisher in the early 20th century. Sexual
selection can, typically, lead males to extreme efforts to demonstrate their
fitness to be chosen by females, producing sexual_dimorphism in secondary
sexual_characteristics, such as the ornate plumage of birds such as birds_of
paradise and peafowl, or the antlers of deer, or the manes of lions, caused by
a positive_feedback mechanism known as a Fisherian_runaway, where the passing-
on of the desire for a trait in one sex is as important as having the trait in
the other sex in producing the runaway effect. Although the sexy_son_hypothesis
indicates that females would prefer male offspring, Fisher's_principle explains
why the sex_ratio is 1:1 almost without exception. Sexual selection is also
found in plants and fungi.[4][5]
The maintenance of sexual reproduction in a highly competitive world is one of
the major puzzles in biology given that asexual_reproduction can reproduce much
more quickly as 50% of offspring are not males, unable to produce offspring
themselves. Many non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed,[6] including the
positive impact of an additional form of selection, sexual selection, on the
probability of persistence of a species.[7]

***** History[edit] *****
**** Darwin[edit] ****
Sexual selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin in The_Origin_of_Species
(1859) and developed in The_Descent_of_Man_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex
(1871), as he felt that natural selection alone was unable to account for
certain types of non-survival adaptations. He once wrote to a colleague that
"The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me
sick!" His work divided sexual selection into male-male competition and female
choice.
     ... depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle
     between the males for possession of the females; the result is not
     death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring.[8]
     ... when the males and females of any animal have the same general
     habits ... but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such
     differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection.[9]
These views were to some extent opposed by Alfred_Russel_Wallace, mostly after
Darwin's death. He accepted that sexual selection could occur, but argued that
it was a relatively weak form of selection. He argued that male-male
competitions were forms of natural selection, but that the "drab" peahen's
coloration is itself adaptive as camouflage. In his opinion, ascribing mate
choice to females was attributing the ability to judge standards of beauty to
animals (such as beetles) far too cognitively undeveloped to be capable of
aesthetic feeling.[10]
**** Ronald Fisher[edit] ****
Ronald_Fisher, the English statistician and evolutionary_biologist developed a
number of ideas about sexual selection in his 1930 book The_Genetical_Theory_of
Natural_Selection including the sexy_son_hypothesis and Fisher's_principle. The
Fisherian_runaway describes how sexual selection accelerates the preference for
a specific ornament, causing the preferred trait and female preference for it
to increase together in a positive_feedback runaway cycle. In a remark that was
not widely understood[11] for another 50 years he said:
     ... plumage development in the male, and sexual preference for such
     developments in the female, must thus advance together, and so long
     as the process is unchecked by severe counterselection, will advance
     with ever-increasing speed. In the total absence of such checks, it
     is easy to see that the speed of development will be proportional to
     the development already attained, which will therefore increase with
     time exponentially, or in geometric_progression. âRonald Fisher,
     1930
Male long-tailed_widowbird
This causes a dramatic increase in both the male's conspicuous feature and in
female preference for it, resulting in marked sexual_dimorphism, until
practical physical constraints halt further exaggeration. A positive_feedback
loop is created, producing extravagant physical structures in the non-limiting
sex. A classic example of female choice and potential runaway selection is the
long-tailed_widowbird. While males have long tails that are selected for by
female choice, female tastes in tail length are still more extreme with females
being attracted to tails longer than those that naturally occur.[12] Fisher
understood that female preference for long tails may be passed on genetically,
in conjunction with genes for the long tail itself. Long-tailed widowbird
offspring of both sexes inherit both sets of genes, with females expressing
their genetic preference for long tails, and males showing off the coveted long
tail itself.[11]
Richard_Dawkins presents a non-mathematical explanation of the runaway sexual
selection process in his book The_Blind_Watchmaker.[11] Females that prefer
long tailed males tend to have mothers that chose long-tailed fathers. As a
result, they carry both sets of genes in their bodies. That is, genes for long
tails and for preferring long tails become linked. The taste for long tails and
tail length itself may therefore become correlated, tending to increase
together. The more tails lengthen, the more long tails are desired. Any slight
initial imbalance between taste and tails may set off an explosion in tail
lengths. Fisher wrote that:
     The exponential element, which is the kernel of the thing, arises
     from the rate of change in hen taste being proportional to the
     absolute average degree of taste. âRonald Fisher, 1932[13]
The peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a Fisherian_runaway
The female widow bird chooses to mate with the most attractive long-tailed male
so that her progeny, if male, will themselves be attractive to females of the
next generation - thereby fathering many offspring that carry the female's
genes. Since the rate of change in preference is proportional to the average
taste amongst females, and as females desire to secure the services of the most
sexually attractive males, an additive effect is created that, if unchecked,
can yield exponential increases in a given taste and in the corresponding
desired sexual attribute.
     It is important to notice that the conditions of relative stability
     brought about by these or other means, will be far longer duration
     than the process in which the ornaments are evolved. In most existing
     species the runaway process must have been already checked, and we
     should expect that the more extraordinary developments of sexual
     plumage are not due like most characters to a long and even course of
     evolutionary progress, but to sudden spurts of change. âRonald
     Fisher, 1930
Since Fisher's initial conceptual model of the 'runaway' process, Russell Lande
[14] and Peter O'Donald[15] have provided detailed mathematical proofs that
define the circumstances under which runaway sexual selection can take place.

**** Reproductive success[edit] ****
Extinct Irish_elk (Megaloceros giganteus). These antlers span 2.7 metres
(8.9 ft) and have a mass of 40 kg (88 lb).
The reproductive_success of an organism is measured by the number of offspring
left behind, and their quality or probable fitness.
Sexual preference creates a tendency towards assortative_mating or homogamy.
The general conditions of sexual discrimination appear to be (1) the acceptance
of one mate precludes the effective acceptance of alternative mates, and (2)
the rejection of an offer is followed by other offers, either certainly or at
such high chance that the risk of non-occurrence is smaller than the chance
advantage to be gained by selecting a mate.
The conditions determining which sex becomes the more limited resource in
intersexual selection have been hypothesized with Bateman's_principle, which
states that the sex which invests the most in producing offspring becomes a
limiting resource for which the other sex competes, illustrated by the greater
nutritional_investment of an egg in a zygote, and the limited capacity of
females to reproduce; for example, in humans, a woman can only give birth every
ten months, whereas a male can become a father numerous times in the same
period.
**** Modern interpretation[edit] ****
Male mountain_gorilla, a tournament species
The sciences of evolutionary_psychology, human_behavioural_ecology, and
sociobiology study the influence of sexual selection in humans.
Darwin's ideas on sexual selection were met with scepticism by his
contemporaries and not considered of great importance in the early 20th
century, until in the 1930s biologists decided to include sexual selection as a
mode of natural selection.[16] Only in the 21st century have they become more
important in biology.[17] The theory however is generally applicable and
analogous to natural selection.[18]
Flour beetle
Tungara frog
Research in 2015 indicates that sexual selection, including mate_choice,
"improves population health and protects against extinction, even in the face
of genetic stress from high levels of inbreeding" and "ultimately dictates who
gets to reproduce their genes into the next generation - so it's a widespread
and very powerful evolutionary force." The study involved the flour_beetle over
a ten-year period where the only changes were in the intensity of sexual
selection.[7]
Another theory, the handicap_principle of Amotz_Zahavi, Russell_Lande and W._D.
Hamilton, holds that the fact that the male is able to survive until and
through the age of reproduction with such a seemingly maladaptive trait is
taken by the female to be a testament to his overall fitness. Such handicaps
might prove he is either free of or resistant to disease, or that he possesses
more speed or a greater physical strength that is used to combat the troubles
brought on by the exaggerated trait. Zahavi's work spurred a re-examination of
the field, which has produced an ever-accelerating number of theories. In 1984,
Hamilton and Marlene_Zuk introduced the "Bright Male" hypothesis, suggesting
that male elaborations might serve as a marker of health, by exaggerating the
effects of disease and deficiency. In 1990, Michael Ryan and A.S. Rand, working
with the tungara_frog, proposed the hypothesis of "Sensory Exploitation", where
exaggerated male traits may provide a sensory stimulation that females find
hard to resist. Subsequently, the theories of the "Gravity Hypothesis" by Jordi
Moya-Larano et al. (2002), invoking a simple biomechanical model to account for
the adaptive value for smaller male spiders of speed in climbing vertical
surfaces,[19] and "Chase Away" by Brett Holland and William R. Rice have been
added. In the late 1970s, Janzen and Mary Willson, noting that male flowers are
often larger than female flowers, expanded the field of sexual selection into
plants.[20]
In the past few years, the field has exploded to include other areas of study,
not all of which fit Darwin's definition of sexual selection. These include
cuckoldry, nuptial gifts, sperm_competition, infanticide (especially in
primates), physical beauty, mating by subterfuge, species isolation mechanisms,
male parental care, ambiparental care, mate location, polygamy, and homosexual
rape in certain male animals.
Focusing on the effect of sexual_conflict, as hypothesized by William Rice,
Locke Rowe et GÃ¶ran Arnvist, Thierry_LodÃ© argues that divergence of interest
constitutes a key for evolutionary process. Sexual conflict leads to an
antagonistic_co-evolution in which one sex tends to control the other,
resulting in a tug of war. Besides, the sexual propaganda theory only argued
that mates were opportunistically led, on the basis of various factors
determining the choice such as phenotypic characteristics, apparent vigour of
individuals, strength of mate signals, trophic resources, territoriality, etc.,
but and could explain the maintenance of genetic diversity within populations.
[21]
Several workers have brought attention to the fact that elaborated characters
that ought to be costly in one way or another for their bearers (e.g., the
tails of some species of Xiphophorus fish) do not always appear to have a cost
in terms of energetics, performance or even survival. One possible explanation
for the apparent lack of costs is that "compensatory traits" have evolved in
concert with the sexually selected traits.[22]
**** Toolkit of natural selection[edit] ****
Protarchaeopteryx - skull based on Incisivosaurus and wings on Caudipteryx
Sexual selection may explain how certain characteristics (such as feathers) had
distinct survival value at an early stage in their evolution. Geoffrey_Miller
proposes that sexual selection might have contributed by creating evolutionary
modules such as Archaeopteryx feathers as sexual ornaments, at first. The
earliest proto-birds such as China's Protarchaeopteryx, discovered in the early
1990s, had well-developed feathers but no sign of the top/bottom asymmetry that
gives wings lift. Some have suggested that the feathers served as insulation,
helping females incubate their eggs. But perhaps the feathers served as the
kinds of sexual ornaments still common in most bird species, and especially in
birds such as peacocks and birds-of-paradise today. If proto-bird courtship
displays combined displays of forelimb feathers with energetic jumps, then the
transition from display to aerodynamic functions could have been relatively
smooth.[23]
Sexual selection sometimes generates features that may help cause a species'
extinction, as has been suggested[23] for the giant antlers of the Irish_elk
(Megaloceros giganteus) that became extinct in Pleistocene Europe.[24] However,
sexual selection can also do the opposite, driving species divergence -
sometimes through elaborate changes in genitalia - such that new species
emerge.[25][26][27]

Main article: Sexual_dimorphism
Sex differences directly related to reproduction and serving no direct purpose
in courtship are called primary_sexual_characteristics. Traits amenable to
sexual selection, which give an organism an advantage over its rivals (such as
in courtship) without being directly involved in reproduction, are called
secondary_sex_characteristics.
The rhinoceros_beetle is a classic case of sexual_dimorphism. Plate from
Darwin's Descent_of_Man, male at top, female at bottom
In most sexual species the males and females have different equilibrium
strategies, due to a difference in relative investment in producing offspring.
As formulated in Bateman's principle, females have a greater initial investment
in producing offspring (pregnancy in mammals or the production of the egg in
birds and reptiles), and this difference in initial investment creates
differences in variance in expected reproductive success and bootstraps the
sexual selection processes. Classic examples of reversed sex-role species
include the pipefish, and Wilson's_phalarope[28]. Also, unlike a female, a male
(except in monogamous species) has some uncertainty about whether or not he is
the true parent of a child, and so is less interested in spending his energy
helping to raise offspring that may or may not be related to him. As a result
of these factors, males are typically more willing to mate than females, and so
females are typically the ones doing the choosing (except in cases of forced
copulations, which can occur in certain species of primates, ducks, and
others). The effects of sexual selection are thus held to typically be more
pronounced in males than in females.
Differences in secondary sexual characteristics between males and females of a
species are referred to as sexual_dimorphisms. These can be as subtle as a size
difference (sexual size dimorphism, often abbreviated as SSD) or as extreme as
horns and colour patterns. Sexual dimorphisms abound in nature. Examples
include the possession of antlers by only male deer, the brighter coloration of
many male birds in comparison with females of the same species, or even more
distinct differences in basic morphology, such as the drastically increased
eye-span of the male stalk-eyed_fly. The peacock, with its elaborate and
colourful tail feathers, which the peahen lacks, is often referred to as
perhaps the most extraordinary example of a dimorphism. Male and female black-
throated_blue_warblers and Guianan_cock-of-the-rocks also differ radically in
their plumage. Early naturalists even believed the females to be a separate
species. The largest sexual size dimorphism in vertebrates is the shell
dwelling cichlid fish Neolamprologus_callipterus in which males are up to 30
times the size of females[29]. Many other fish such as guppies also exhibit
sexual dimorphism. Extreme sexual size dimorphism, with females larger than
males, is quite common in spiders and birds_of_prey.
***** The Role of Male-Male Competition in Sexual Selection[edit] *****
Male-male competition occurs when two males of the same species compete for the
opportunity to mate with a female. Sexually_dimorphic traits, size, sex ratio
[30] and the social situation [31] may all play a role in the effects male-male
competition has on the reproductive success of a male and the mate choice of a
female.
**** Conditions that Influence Competition[edit] ****
*** Sex Ratio[edit] ***
Japanese medaka, Orzyas latipes.
There are multiple types of male-male competition that may occur in a
population at different times depending on the conditions. Competition
variation occurs based on the frequency of various mating behaviours present in
the population.[30] One factor that can influence the type of competition
observed is the population density of males.[30] When there is a high density
of males present in the population, competition tends to be less aggressive and
therefore sneak tactics and disruptions techniques are more often employed.[30]
These techniques often indicate a type of competition referred to as scramble
competition.[30] In Japanese medaka, Oryzias_latipes, sneaking behaviours refer
to when a male interrupts a mating pair during copulation by grasping on to
either the male or the female and releasing their own sperm in the hopes of
being the one to fertilize the female.[30] Disruption is a technique which
involves one male bumping the male that is copulating with the female away just
before his sperm is released and the eggs are fertilized.[30]
However, all techniques are not equally successful when in competition for
reproductive success. Disruption results in a shorter copulation period and can
therefore disrupt the fertilization of the eggs by the sperm, which frequently
results in lower rates of fertilization and smaller clutch size.[30]
*** Resource Value and Social Ranking[edit] ***
Another factor that can influence male-male competition is the value of the
resource to competitors. Male-male competition can pose many risks to a male's
fitness, such as high energy expenditure, physical injury, lower sperm quality
and lost paternity.[32] The risk of competition must therefore be worth the
value of the resource. A male is more likely to engage in competition for a
resource that improves their reproductive success if the resource value is
higher. While male-male competition can occur in the presence or absence of a
female, competition occurs more frequently in the presence of a female.[31] The
presence of a female directly increases the resource value of a territory or
shelter and so the males are more likely to accept the risk of competition when
a female is present.[31] The smaller males of a species are also more likely to
engage in competition with larger males in the presence of a female.[31] Due to
the higher level of risk for subordinate males, they tend to engage in
competition less frequently than larger, more dominant males and therefore
breed less frequently than dominant males.[32] This is seen in many species,
such as the Omei treefrog, Rhacophorus_omeimontis, where larger males obtained
more mating opportunities and successfully mated with larger mates. [33]
*** Winner-Loser Effects[edit] ***
A third factor that can impact the success of a male in competition is winner-
loser_effects.[34] Burrowing crickets, velarifictorous aspersus, compete for
burrows to attract females using their large mandibles for fighting. [34]
Female burrowing crickets, are more likely to choose winner of a competition in
the 2 hours after the fight.[34] The presence winning male suppresses mating
behaviours of the losing males because the winning male tends to produce more
frequent and enhanced mating calls in this period of time.[34]
**** Effect of Male-Male Competition on Female Fitness[edit] ****
Male-male competition can both positively and negatively affect female fitness.
When there is a high density of males in a population and a large number of
males attempting to mate with the female, she is more likely to resist mating
attempts, resulting in lower fertilization rates.[30] High levels of male-male
competition can also result in a reduction in female investment in mating.[32]
Many forms of competition can also cause significant distress for the female
negatively impacting her ability to reproduce.[30] An increase in male-male
competition can affect a females ability to select the best mates, and
therefore decrease the likelihood of successful reproduction.[35]
However, group mating in Japanese medaka has been shown to positively affect
the fitness of females due to an increase in genetic variation, a higher
likelihood of paternal care and a higher likelihood of successful
fertilization.[30]
**** Examples[edit] ****
A leaf-footed cactus bug, Narnia femorata.
In Japanese medaka, females mate daily during mating season.[30] Males compete
for the opportunity to mate with the female by displaying themselves
aggressively and chasing each other.[30] To obtain the selection of the
females, they court the females prior to copulation by performing a courting
behaviour referred to as "quick circles".[30]
In leaf-footed_cactus_bugs, Narnia femorata, males compete for territories
where females can lay their eggs.[31] Males compete more intensely for cacti
territories with fruit to attract females. [31] In this species, the males
possess sexually dimorphic traits, such as their larger size and hind legs,
which are used to gain the most advantage over competitors when females are
present, but are not used in the absence of females.
Anuran (such as frogs) select habitats (pools) free of conspecifics in order to
minimize male-male competition for both themselves and their offspring.[35]
Displays are used in attempt to keep competitors out of their territory and
deter sneaking behaviours, while fighting is only used when necessary due to
the high costs and risks associated with fighting.[35]

Sexual selection has been observed to occur in plants, animals and fungi.[5] In
certain hermaphroditic snail and slug species of molluscs the throwing of love
darts is a form of sexual selection.[36] Certain male insects of the
lepidoptera order of insects cement the vaginal pores of their females.[37]
A male bed_bug (Cimex lectularius) traumatically inseminates a female bed bug

Today, biologists say that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by
intraspecific_competition - competition between members of the same species -
distinguishing between competition before or after sexual_intercourse.
Illustration from The Descent of Man showing the tufted_coquette Lophornis
ornatus: female on left, ornamented male on right
Before copulation, intrasexual selection - usually between males - may take the
form of male-to-male combat. Also, intersexual selection, or mate_choice,
occurs when females choose between male mates.[38] Traits selected by male
combat are called secondary sexual characteristics (including horns, antlers,
etc.), which Darwin described as "weapons", while traits selected by mate
(usually female) choice are called "ornaments". Due to their sometimes greatly
exaggerated nature, secondary sexual characteristics can prove to be a
hindrance to an animal, thereby lowering its chances of survival. For example,
the large antlers of a moose are bulky and heavy and slow the creature's flight
from predators; they also can become entangled in low-hanging tree branches and
shrubs, and undoubtedly have led to the demise of many individuals. Bright
colourations and showy ornamenations, such as those seen in many male birds, in
addition to capturing the eyes of females, also attract the attention of
predators. Some of these traits also represent energetically costly investments
for the animals that bear them. Because traits held to be due to sexual
selection often conflict with the survival fitness of the individual, the
question then arises as to why, in nature, in which survival_of_the_fittest is
considered the rule of thumb, such apparent liabilities are allowed to persist.
However, one must also consider that intersexual selection can occur with an
emphasis on resources that one sex possesses rather than morphological and
physiological differences. For example, males of Euglossa_imperialis, a non-
social bee species, form aggregations of territories considered to be leks, to
defend fragrant-rich primary territories. The purpose of these aggregations is
only facultative, since the more suitable fragrant-rich sites there are, the
more habitable territories there are to inhabit, giving females of this species
a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate.[39]
After copulation, maleâmale competition distinct from conventional aggression
may take the form of sperm_competition, as described by Parker[40] in 1970.
More recently, interest has arisen in cryptic_female_choice,[41] a phenomenon
of internally fertilised animals such as mammals and birds, where a female can
get rid of a male's sperm without his knowledge.
Victorian cartoonists quickly picked up on Darwin's ideas about display in
sexual selection. Here he is fascinated by the apparent steatopygia in the
latest fashion.
Finally, sexual_conflict is said to occur between breeding partners,[42]
sometimes leading to an evolutionary_arms_race between males and females.
Sexual selection can also occur as a product of pheromone release, such as with
the stingless bee, Trigona_corvina.[43]
Female mating preferences are widely recognized as being responsible for the
rapid and divergent evolution of male secondary sexual traits.[44] Females of
many animal species prefer to mate with males with external ornaments -
exaggerated features of morphology such as elaborate sex organs. These
preferences may arise when an arbitrary female preference for some aspect of
male morphology â initially, perhaps, a result of genetic_drift â creates,
in due course, selection for males with the appropriate ornament. One
interpretation of this is known as the sexy_son_hypothesis. Alternatively,
genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may
simply show off greater disease_resistance or a more efficient metabolism,
features that also benefit females. This idea is known as the good_genes
hypothesis.
Bright colors that develop in animals during mating season function to attract
partners. It has been suggested that there is a causal link between strength of
display of ornaments involved in sexual selection and free radical biology.[45]
To test this idea, experiments were performed on male painted_dragon_lizards.
[46] Male lizards are brightly conspicuous in their breeding coloration, but
their color declines with aging. Experiments involving administration of
antioxidants to these males led to the conclusion that breeding coloration is a
reflection of innate anti-oxidation capacity that protects against oxidative
damage, including oxidative_DNA_damage.[46] Thus color could act as a âhealth
certificateâ that allows females to visualize the underlying oxidative_stress
induced damage in potential mates.
Darwin conjectured that heritable traits such as beards and hairlessness in
different human populations are results of sexual_selection_in_humans. Geoffrey
Miller has hypothesized that many human behaviours not clearly tied to survival
benefits, such as humour, music, visual art, verbal creativity, and some forms
of altruism, are courtship adaptations that have been favoured through sexual
selection. In that view, many human artefacts could be considered subject to
sexual selection as part of the extended_phenotype, for instance clothing that
enhances sexually selected traits. Some argue that the evolution_of_human
intelligence is a sexually selected trait, as it would not confer enough
fitness in itself relative to its high maintenance costs.[47]
