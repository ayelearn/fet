Associated populations of species in a given area
"Ecological community" redirects here. For human community organized around
economic and ecological sustainability, see ecovillage.
Interspecific interactions such as predation are a key aspect of community
ecology.
In ecology, a community is a group or association of populations of two or more
different species occupying the same geographical area and in a particular
time, also known as a biocoenosis. The term community has a variety of uses. In
its simplest form it refers to groups of organisms in a specific place or time,
for example, "the fish community of Lake Ontario before industrialization".
Community ecology or synecology is the study of the interactions between
species in communities on many spatial and temporal scales, including the
distribution, structure, abundance, demography, and interactions between
coexisting populations.[1] The primary focus of community ecology is on the
interactions between populations as determined by specific genotypic and
phenotypic characteristics. Community ecology has its origin in European plant
sociology. Modern community ecology examines patterns such as variation in
species_richness, equitability, productivity and food_web structure (see
community_structure); it also examines processes such as predatorâprey
population_dynamics, succession, and community_assembly.
On a deeper level the meaning and value of the community concept in ecology is
up for debate. Communities have traditionally been understood on a fine scale
in terms of local processes constructing (or destructing) an assemblage of
species, such as the way climate change is likely to affect the make-up of
grass communities.[2] Recently this local community focus has been criticised.
Robert_Ricklefs has argued that it is more useful to think of communities on a
regional scale, drawing on evolutionary taxonomy and biogeography,[1] where
some species or clades evolve and others go extinct.[3]

***** Theories[edit] *****
**** Holistic theory[edit] ****
Clements developed a holistic_(or_organismic) concept of community, as it was a
superorganism or discrete unit, with sharp boundaries.
**** Individualistic theory[edit] ****
Gleason developed the individualistic (also known as open or continuum) concept
of community, with the abundance of a population of a species changing
gradually along complex environmental gradients, but individually, not equally
to other populations. In that view, it is possible that individualistic
distribution of species gives rise to discrete communities as well as to
continuum. Niches would not overlap.[4][5]
**** Neutral theory[edit] ****
In the neutral_theory view of the community (or metacommunity), popularized by
Hubbell, species are functionally equivalent, and the abundance of a population
of a species changes by stochastic demographic processes (i.e., random births
and deaths).[6] Each population would have the same adaptive_value (competitive
and dispersal abilities), and local and regional composition would represent a
balance between speciation or dispersal (which increase diversity), and random
extinctions (which decrease diversity).[7]
***** Interspecific interactions[edit] *****
Species interact in various ways: competition, predation, parasitism,
mutualism, commensalism, etc. The organization of a biological community with
respect to ecological interactions is referred to as community structure.
**** Competition[edit] ****
Species can compete with each other for finite resources. It is considered to
be an important limiting factor of population_size, biomass and species
richness. Many types of competition have been described, but proving the
existence of these interactions is a matter of debate. Direct competition has
been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little
evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large
groups.[8]
   1. Interference competition: occurs when an individual of one species
      directly interferes with an individual of another species. Examples
      include a lion chasing a hyena from a kill, or a plant releasing
      allelopathic chemicals to impede the growth of a competing species.
   2. Exploitative competition: This occurs via the consumption of resources.
      When an individual of one species consumes a resource (e.g., food,
      shelter, sunlight, etc.), that resource is no longer available to be
      consumed by a member of a second species. Exploitative competition is
      thought to be more common in nature, but care must be taken to
      distinguish it from apparent competition. Exploitative competition vary
      from complete_symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of
      resources, irrespective of their size) to perfectly_size_symmetric (all
      individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to
      absolutely size-asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the
      available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on
      the structure and diversity of ecological communities
   3. Apparent competition: occurs when two species share a predator. The
      populations of both species can be depressed by predation without direct
      exploitative competition.[9]
**** Predation[edit] ****
Predation is hunting another species for food. This is a positiveânegative (+
â) interaction in that the predator species benefits while the prey species
is harmed. Some predators kill their prey before eating them (e.g., a hawk
killing a mouse). Other predators are parasites that feed on prey while alive
(e.g., a vampire bat feeding on a cow). Another example is the feeding on
plants of herbivores (e.g., a cow grazing). Predation may affect the population
size of predators and prey and the number of species coexisting in a community.
**** Mutualism[edit] ****
Mutualism is an interaction between species in which both benefit. Examples
include Rhizobium bacteria growing in nodules on the roots of legumes and
insects pollinating the flowers of angiosperms.
**** Commensalism[edit] ****
Commensalism is a type of relationship among organisms in which one organism
benefits while the other organism is neither benefited nor harmed. The organism
that benefited is called the commensal while the other organism that is neither
benefited nor harmed is called the host. For example, an epiphytic orchid
attached to the tree for support benefits the orchid but neither harms nor
benefits the tree. The opposite of commensalism is amensalism, an interspecific
relationship in which a product of one organism has a negative effect on
another organism but the original organism is unaffected.[10]
**** Parasitism[edit] ****
Parasitism is an interaction in which one organism, the host, is harmed while
the other, the parasite, benefits.
***** Community structure[edit] *****
A major research theme among community ecology has been whether ecological
communities have a (nonrandom) structure and, if so how to characterise this
structure. Forms of community structure include aggregation[11] and nestedness.
