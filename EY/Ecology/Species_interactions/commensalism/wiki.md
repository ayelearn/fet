****** Commensalism ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
An interaction between two organisms living together in more or less intimate
association in a relationship in which one benefits and the other is
unaffected.
Remora are specially adapted to attach themselves to larger fish that provide
locomotion and food.
Commensalism is a long-term biological interaction (symbiosis) in which members
of one species gain benefits while those of the other species neither benefit
nor are harmed.[1] This is in contrast with mutualism, in which both organisms
benefit from each other, amensalism, where one is harmed while the other is
unaffected, and parasitism, where one benefits while the other is harmed. The
commensal (the species that benefits from the association) may obtain
nutrients, shelter, support, or locomotion from the host species, which is
substantially unaffected. The commensal relation is often between a larger host
and a smaller commensal; the host organism is unmodified, whereas the commensal
species may show great structural adaptation consonant with its habits, as in
the remoras that ride attached to sharks and other fishes. Remoras feed on
their hosts' fecal matter[2], while pilot_fish feed on the leftovers of their
hosts' meals. Numerous birds perch on bodies of large mammal herbivores or feed
on the insects turned up by grazing mammals.[3]

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word "commensalism" is derived from the word "commensal", meaning "eating
at the same table" in human social interaction, which in turn comes through
French from the Medieval_Latin commensalis, meaning "sharing a table", from the
prefix com-, meaning "together", and mensa, meaning "table" or "meal".[4]
Commensality, at Oxford and Cambridge Universities, refers to professors eating
at the same table as students (as they live in the same "college").
Pierre-Joseph_van_Beneden introduced the term "commensalism" in 1876.[5]
***** Examples of commensal relationships[edit] *****
The commensal pathway was traveled by animals that fed on refuse around human
habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human camps. Those
animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals
benefited but the humans received little benefit or harm. Those animals that
were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human
camps would have been the âtamerâ individuals: less aggressive, with
shorter fight-or-flight distances. Later, these animals developed closer social
or economic bonds with humans and led to a domestic relationship.[6][7]
The leap from a synanthropic population to a domestic one could only have taken
place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to
commensalism and partnership, at which point the establishment of a reciprocal
relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for
domestication, including captivity and then human-controlled breeding. From
this perspective, animal domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a
population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche that
includes another species with evolving behaviors.[7]
Commensal pathway animals include dogs, cats, fowl, and possibly pigs.
**** Dogs[edit] ****
The dog was the first domesticated animal, and was domesticated and widely
established across Eurasia before the end of the Pleistocene, well before the
cultivation of crops or the domestication of other animals.[8] The dog is often
hypothesised to be a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled
a commensal pathway into domestication. Archaeological evidence, such as the
Bonn-Oberkassel dog dating to ~14,000BP,[9] supports the hypothesis that dog
domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture [10][11] and began close to
the Last_Glacial_Maximum when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna.
The wolves more likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive,
subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress
thresholds, and less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for
domestication.[6] Proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on
site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense
from large competing predators at kills.[11] However, the extent to which
proto-domestic wolves could have become dependent on this way of life prior to
domestication and without human provisioning is unclear and highly debated. In
contrast, cats may have become fully dependent on a commensal lifestyle before
being domesticated by preying on other commensal animals, such as rats and
mice, without any human provisioning. Debate over the extent to which some
wolves were commensal with humans prior to domestication stems from debate over
the level of human intentionality in the domestication process, which remains
untested.[7][12]
The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotonization of skull
morphology[13][14][6] and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth
crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a reduction in the number of teeth,[15]
[6] which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression.
[14][6] This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog
domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.
[6][7]
A mitochondrial, microsatellite, and Y-chromosome assessment of two wolf
populations in North America combined with satellite telemetry data revealed
significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that
migrated with and preyed upon caribou and another territorial ecotype
population that remained in a boreal coniferous forest. Although these two
populations spend a period of the year in the same place, and though there was
evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in preyâhabitat
specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration
divergence.[16][7]
A different study has identified the remains of a population of extinct
Pleistocene Beringian_wolves with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull
shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these remains were derived
from a population of specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became
extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived.[17][7] Analogous to the
modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a
Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers,
thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have
allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat.[18][7]
**** Aspergillus and Staphylococcus[edit] ****
See also: Aspergillus and Staphylococcus
Numerous genera of bacteria and fungi live on and in the human body as part of
its natural flora. The fungal genus Aspergillus is capable of living under
considerable environmental stress, and thus is capable of colonising the upper
gastrointestinal tract where relatively few examples of the body's gut flora
can survive due to highly acidic or alkaline conditions produced by gastric
acid and digestive juices. While Aspergillus normally produces no symptoms, in
individuals who are immunocompromised or suffering from existing conditions
such as tuberculosis, a condition called aspergillosis can occur, in which
populations of Aspergillus grow out of control.
Staphylococcus_aureus, a common bacterial species, is known best for its
numerous pathogenic strains that can cause numerous illnesses and conditions.
However, many strains of S. aureus are metabiotic commensals, and are present
on roughly 20 to 30% of the human population as part of the skin_flora.[19] S.
aureus also benefits from the variable ambient conditions created by the body's
mucous membranes, and as such can be found in the oral and nasal_cavities, as
well as inside the ear_canal. Other Staphylococcus species including S.
warneri, S._lugdunensis and S._epidermidis, will also engage in commensalism
for similar purposes.
***** Arguments[edit] *****
Whether the relationship between humans and some types of gut_flora is
commensal or mutualistic is still unanswered.
Some biologists argue that any close interaction between two organisms is
unlikely to be completely neutral for either party, and that relationships
identified as commensal are likely mutualistic or parasitic in a subtle way
that has not been detected. For example, epiphytes are "nutritional pirates"
that may intercept substantial amounts of nutrients that would otherwise go to
the host plant.[20] Large numbers of epiphytes can also cause tree limbs to
break or shade the host plant and reduce its rate of photosynthesis. Similarly,
phoretic mites may hinder their host by making flight more difficult, which may
affect its aerial hunting ability or cause it to expend extra energy while
carrying these passengers.
***** Types[edit] *****
Phoretic mites on a fly (Pseudolynchia canariensis)
Like all ecological interactions, commensalisms vary in strength and duration
from intimate, long-lived symbioses to brief, weak interactions through
intermediaries.
**** Phoresy[edit] ****
Phoresy is one animal attached to another exclusively for transport, mainly
arthropods, examples of which are mites on insects (such as beetles, flies or
bees), pseudoscorpions on mammals[21] or beetles, and millipedes on birds.[22]
Phoresy can be either obligate or facultative (induced by environmental
conditions).
**** Inquilinism[edit] ****
Inquilinism: Tillandsia_bourgaei growing on an oak tree in Mexico
Inquilinism is the use of a second organism for permanent housing. Examples are
epiphytic plants (such as many orchids) that grow on trees,[23] or birds that
live in holes in trees.
**** Metabiosis[edit] ****
Metabiosis is a more indirect dependency, in which one organism creates or
prepares a suitable environment for a second. Examples include maggots, which
feast and develop on corpses, and hermit_crabs, which use gastropod shells to
protect their bodies.
