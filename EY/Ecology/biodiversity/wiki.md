Variety and variability of life forms
A sampling of fungi collected during summer 2008 in Northern Saskatchewan mixed
woods, near LaRonge is an example regarding the species diversity of fungi. In
this photo, there are also leaf lichens and mosses.
Biodiversity is the variety and variability of life_on_Earth. Biodiversity is
typically a measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem level.
[1] Terrestrial biodiversity is usually greater near the equator,[2] which is
the result of the warm climate and high primary_productivity.[3] Biodiversity
is not distributed evenly on Earth, and is richest in the tropics. These
tropical forest ecosystems cover less than 10 percent of earth's surface, and
contain about 90 percent of the world's species.[4] Marine_biodiversity is
usually highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea_surface
temperature is highest, and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There
are latitudinal_gradients_in_species_diversity.[5] Biodiversity generally tends
to cluster in hotspots,[6] and has been increasing through time,[7][8] but will
be likely to slow in the future.[9]
Rapid environmental_changes typically cause mass_extinctions.[10][11][12] More
than 99.9 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, amounting to over
five billion species,[13] are estimated to be extinct.[14][15] Estimates on the
number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million,[16] of
which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet
been described.[17] More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1
trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-
thousandth of one percent described.[18] The total amount of related DNA base
pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes.[19] In
comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as
4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon).[20] In July 2016, scientists reported
identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last_Universal_Common_Ancestor (LUCA)
of all organisms living on Earth.[21]
The age_of_the_Earth is about 4.54 billion years.[22][23][24] The earliest
undisputed evidence of life_on_Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago,
[25][26][27] during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to
solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon. There are microbial_mat
fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western
Australia.[28][29][30] Other early physical evidence of a biogenic_substance is
graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old meta-sedimentary_rocks discovered in Western
Greenland.[31] More recently, in 2015, "remains of biotic_life" were found in
4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[32][33] According to one of
the researchers, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth .. then it could be
common in the universe."[32]
Since life_began_on_Earth, five major mass_extinctions and several minor events
have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity. The Phanerozoic eon (the
last 540 million years) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the Cambrian
explosionâa period during which the majority of multicellular phyla first
appeared.[34] The next 400 million years included repeated, massive
biodiversity_losses classified as mass_extinction events. In the Carboniferous,
rainforest_collapse led to a great loss of plant and animal life.[35] The
PermianâTriassic_extinction_event, 251 million years ago, was the worst;
vertebrate recovery took 30 million years.[36] The most recent, the
CretaceousâPaleogene_extinction_event, occurred 65 million years ago and has
often attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the
extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.[37]
The period since the emergence of humans has displayed an ongoing biodiversity
reduction and an accompanying loss of genetic_diversity. Named the Holocene
extinction, the reduction is caused primarily by human_impacts, particularly
habitat destruction.[38] Conversely, biodiversity positively impacts human
health in a number of ways, although a few negative effects are studied.[39]
The United_Nations designated 2011â2020 as the United_Nations_Decade_on
Biodiversity.[40] and 2021-2030 as the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem
Restoration [41] According to a 2019 Global_Assessment_Report_on_Biodiversity
and_Ecosystem_Services by IPBES, 25% of plant and animal species are threatened
with extinction as the result of human activity.[42][43][44]

***** History of terminology[edit] *****
    * 1916 - The term biological diversity was used first by J. Arthur Harris
      in "The Variable Desert," Scientific American, JSTOR 6182: "The bare
      statement that the region contains a flora rich in genera and species and
      of diverse geographic origin or affinity is entirely inadequate as a
      description of its real biological diversity."
    * 1975 - The term natural diversity was introduced (by The Science Division
      of The Nature Conservancy in a 1975 study, "The Preservation of Natural
      Diversity.")[citation_needed]
    * 1980 - Thomas_Lovejoy introduced the term biological diversity to the
      scientific community in a book.[45] It rapidly became commonly used.[46]
    * 1985 - According to Edward_O._Wilson, the contracted form biodiversity
      was coined by W. G. Rosen: "The National Forum on BioDiversity ... was
      conceived by Walter G.Rosen ... Dr. Rosen represented the NRC/NAS
      throughout the planning stages of the project. Furthermore, he introduced
      the term biodiversity".[47]
    * 1985 - The term "biodiversity" appears in the article, "A New Plan to
      Conserve the Earth's Biota" by Laura Tangley.[48]
    * 1988 - The term biodiversity first appeared in a publication.[49][50]
    * The present - the term has achieved widespread use.
***** Definitions[edit] *****
**** Prior term[edit] ****
"Biodiversity" is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and
long established terms, species_diversity and species_richness.
**** Alternate terms[edit] ****
Biologists most often define biodiversity as the "totality of genes, species
and ecosystems of a region".[51][52] An advantage of this definition is that it
seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the
traditional types of biological variety previously identified:
    * taxonomic diversity (usually measured at the species diversity level)
    * ecological diversity (often viewed from the perspective of ecosystem
      diversity)
    * morphological diversity (which stems from genetic_diversity and molecular
      diversity[53])
    * functional_diversity (which is a measure of the number of functionally
      disparate species within a population (e.g. different feeding mechanism,
      different motility, predator vs prey, etc.)[54]) This multilevel
      construct is consistent with Datman and Lovejoy.
**** Wilcox 1982[edit] ****
An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a
paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the International_Union_for_the
Conservation_of_Nature_and_Natural_Resources (IUCN) for the 1982 World National
Parks Conference. Wilcox's definition was "Biological diversity is the variety
of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular,
organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...".[55]
**** Genetic: Wilcox 1984[edit] ****
Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles, genes and
organisms. They study processes such as mutation and gene_transfer that drive
evolution.[55]
**** United Nations 1992[edit] ****
The 1992 United_Nations Earth_Summit defined "biological diversity" as "the
variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia',
terrestrial, marine and other aquatic_ecosystems and the ecological complexes
of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species
and of ecosystems".[56] This definition is used in the United Nations
Convention_on_Biological_Diversity.[56]
**** Gaston and Spicer 2004[edit] ****
Gaston & Spicer's definition in their book "Biodiversity: an introduction" is
"variation of life at all levels of biological organization".[57]
***** Distribution[edit] *****
A conifer_forest in the Swiss_Alps (National_Park)
Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the
globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all
living things (biota) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils,
geography and the presence of other species. The study of the spatial
distribution of organisms, species and ecosystems, is the science of
biogeography.
Diversity consistently measures higher in the tropics and in other localized
regions such as the Cape_Floristic_Region and lower in polar regions generally.
Rain_forests that have had wet climates for a long time, such as YasunÃ­
National_Park in Ecuador, have particularly high biodiversity.[58][59]
Terrestrial biodiversity is thought to be up to 25 times greater than ocean
biodiversity.[60] A new method used in 2011, put the total number of species on
Earth at 8.7 million, of which 2.1 million were estimated to live in the ocean.
[61] However, this estimate seems to under-represent the diversity of
microorganisms.
**** Latitudinal gradients[edit] ****
Main article: Latitudinal_gradients_in_species_diversity
Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the tropics.
Thus localities at lower latitudes have more species than localities at higher
latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species
diversity. Several ecological factors may contribute to the gradient, but the
ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the
equator compared to that of the poles.[62][63][64]
Even though terrestrial biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles,
[65] some studies claim that this characteristic is unverified in aquatic
ecosystems, especially in marine_ecosystems.[66] The latitudinal distribution
of parasites does not appear to follow this rule.[67]
In 2016, an alternative hypothesis ("the fractal biodiversity") was proposed to
explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient.[68] In this study, the species
pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some
general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers temperature,
moisture, and net_primary_production (NPP) as the main variables of an
ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological hypervolume. In this way, it
is possible to build fractal hypervolumes, whose fractal_dimension rises up to
three moving towards the equator.
**** Hotspots[edit] ****
A biodiversity_hotspot is a region with a high level of endemic species that
have experienced great habitat_loss.[69] The term hotspot was introduced in
1988 by Norman_Myers.[70][71][72][73] While hotspots are spread all over the
world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the tropics.
Brazil's Atlantic_Forest is considered one such hotspot, containing roughly
20,000 plant species, 1,350 vertebrates and millions of insects, about half of
which occur nowhere else.[74][citation_needed] The island of Madagascar and
India are also particularly notable. Colombia is characterized by high
biodiversity, with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide and it
has the largest number of endemics (species that are not found naturally
anywhere else) of any country. About 10% of the species of the Earth can be
found in Colombia, including over 1,900 species of bird, more than in Europe
and North America combined, Colombia has 10% of the world's mammals species,
14% of the amphibian species and 18% of the bird species of the world.[75]
Madagascar_dry_deciduous_forests and lowland rainforests possess a high ratio
of endemism.[76][citation_needed] Since the island separated from mainland
Africa 66 million years ago, many species and ecosystems have evolved
independently.[77] Indonesia's 17,000 islands cover 735,355 square miles
(1,904,560 km2) and contain 10% of the world's flowering_plants, 12% of mammals
and 17% of reptiles, amphibians and birdsâalong with nearly 240 million
people.[78] Many regions of high biodiversity and/or endemism arise from
specialized habitats which require unusual adaptations, for example, alpine
environments in high mountains, or Northern_European peat bogs.[citation
needed]
Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult. Selection
bias amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern
estimates of biodiversity. In 1768, Rev. Gilbert_White succinctly observed of
his Selborne,_Hampshire "all nature is so full, that that district produces the
most variety which is the most examined."[79]
***** Evolution[edit] *****
Main article: Evolution
Apparent marine fossil diversity during the Phanerozoic[80]
**** Chronology[edit] ****
Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of evolution. The origin_of
life has not been definitely established by science, however some evidence
suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred
million years after the formation_of_the_Earth. Until approximately 600 million
years ago, all life consisted of microorganisms â archaea, bacteria, and
single-celled protozoans and protists.
The history of biodiversity during the Phanerozoic (the last 540 million
years), starts with rapid growth during the Cambrian_explosionâa period
during which nearly every phylum of multicellular_organisms first appeared.
Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little
overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend.[81]
This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of
diversity classified as mass_extinction events.[81] A significant loss occurred
when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous.[35] The worst was the Permian-
Triassic_extinction_event, 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million
years to recover from this event.[36]
The fossil_record suggests that the last few million years featured the
greatest biodiversity in history.[81] However, not all scientists support this
view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased
by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections. Some
scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity
may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago.,[82] whereas
others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification
of life.[81] Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary
from 2 million to 100 million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9
million,[61] the vast majority arthropods.[83] Diversity appears to increase
continually in the absence of natural selection.[84]
**** Diversification[edit] ****
The existence of a global carrying capacity, limiting the amount of life that
can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would
also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea shows a
logistic pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows
an exponential rise in diversity. As one author states, "Tetrapods have not yet
invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without
human influence the ecological and taxonomic diversity of tetrapods would
continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the
available ecospace is filled."[81]
It also appears that the diversity continue to increase over time, especially
after mass extinctions.[85]
On the other hand, changes through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with
the hyperbolic model (widely used in population_biology, demography and
macrosociology, as well as fossil biodiversity) than with exponential and
logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided
by a first-order positive_feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a
negative_feedback arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a
second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the world_population
growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size
and the rate of technological growth.[86] The hyperbolic character of
biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between
diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves
of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are
derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and
stochastic dynamics.[86][87]
Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of
a new mass extinction, named the Holocene_extinction_event, caused primarily by
the impact humans are having on the environment.[88] It has been argued that
the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the
planet Earth within 100 years.[89]
In 2011, in his Biodiversity-related Niches Differentiation Theory, Roberto
Cazzolla_Gatti proposed that species themselves are the architects of
biodiversity, by proportionally increasing the number of potentially available
niches in a given ecosystem.[90] This study led to the idea that biodiversity
is autocatalytic.[91] An ecosystem of interdependent species can be, therefore,
considered as an emergent autocatalytic_set (a self-sustaining network of
mutually "catalytic" entities), where one (group of) species enables the
existence of (i.e., creates niches for) other species. This view offers a
possible answer to the fundamental question of why so many species can coexist
in the same ecosystem.
New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5â10,000 new species
each year, most of them insects) and many, though discovered, are not yet
classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all arthropods are not yet
classified).[83] Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in tropical_forests
and in general, land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7 million species
may exists on Earth, of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean.[61]
***** Ecosystem services[edit] *****

Main article: ecosystem_services
**** The balance of evidence[edit] ****
"Ecosystem services are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to
humanity."[92] The natural species, or biota, are the caretakers of all
ecosystems. It is as if the natural world is an enormous bank account of
capital assets capable of paying life sustaining dividends indefinitely, but
only if the capital is maintained.[93]
These services come in three flavors:
   1. Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources
      (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water)[92]
   2. Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change
      (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control)[92]
   3. Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment (e.g.: landscape
      aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation and spiritual
      significance)[94]
There have been many claims about biodiversity's effect on these ecosystem
services, especially provisioning and regulating services. After an exhaustive
survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about
biodiversity's effect on ecosystem services, 14 of those claims have been
validated, 6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported, 3 are incorrect and
13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions.[92]
*** Services enhanced[edit] ***
** Provisioning services[edit] **
Greater species diversity
    * of plants increases fodder yield (synthesis of 271 experimental studies).
      [95]
    * of plants (i.e. diversity within a single species) increases overall crop
      yield (synthesis of 575 experimental studies).[96] Although another
      review of 100 experimental studies reports mixed evidence.[97]
    * of trees increases overall wood_production (Synthesis of 53 experimental
      studies).[98] However, there is not enough data to draw a conclusion
      about the effect of tree trait diversity on wood production.[92]
** Regulating services[edit] **
Greater species diversity
    * of fish increases the stability of fisheries yield (Synthesis of 8
      observational studies)[92]
    * of natural pest enemies decreases herbivorous pest populations (Data from
      two separate reviews; Synthesis of 266 experimental and observational
      studies;[99] Synthesis of 18 observational studies.[100][101] Although
      another review of 38 experimental studies found mixed support for this
      claim, suggesting that in cases where mutual intraguild predation occurs,
      a single predatory species is often more effective[102]
    * of plants decreases disease prevalence on plants (Synthesis of 107
      experimental studies)[103]
    * of plants increases resistance to plant_invasion (Data from two separate
      reviews; Synthesis of 105 experimental studies;[103] Synthesis of 15
      experimental studies[104])
    * of plants increases carbon sequestration, but note that this finding only
      relates to actual uptake of carbon dioxide and not long term storage, see
      below; Synthesis of 479 experimental studies)[95]
    * plants increases soil_nutrient remineralization (Synthesis of 103
      experimental studies)[103]
    * of plants increases soil organic matter (Synthesis of 85 experimental
      studies)[103]
*** Services with mixed evidence[edit] ***
** Provisioning services[edit] **
    * None to date
** Regulating services[edit] **
    * Greater species diversity of plants may or may not decrease herbivorous
      pest populations. Data from two separate reviews suggest that greater
      diversity decreases pest populations (Synthesis of 40 observational
      studies;[105] Synthesis of 100 experimental studies).[97] One review
      found mixed evidence (Synthesis of 287 experimental studies[106]), while
      another found contrary evidence (Synthesis of 100 experimental studies
      [103])
    * Greater species diversity of animals may or may not decrease disease
      prevalence on those animals (Synthesis of 45 experimental and
      observational studies),[107] although a 2013 study offers more support
      showing that biodiversity may in fact enhance disease resistance within
      animal communities, at least in amphibian frog ponds.[108] Many more
      studies must be published in support of diversity to sway the balance of
      evidence will be such that we can draw a general rule on this service.
    * Greater species and trait diversity of plants may or may not increase
      long term carbon storage (Synthesis of 33 observational studies)[92]
    * Greater pollinator diversity may or may not increase pollination
      (Synthesis of 7 observational studies),[92] but a publication from March
      2013 suggests that increased native pollinator diversity enhances pollen
      deposition (although not necessarily fruit set as the authors would have
      you believe, for details explore their lengthy supplementary material).

      â they did however find studies on the effect of species diversity and
      root biomass)[92]
    * Effect of diversity on flood_regulation (In a survey of the literature,
      the investigators could not find any studies)[92]
    * Effect of species and trait diversity of plants on soil_moisture (In a
      survey of the literature, the investigators only found 2 studies)[92]
Other sources have reported somewhat conflicting results and in 1997 Robert
Costanza and his colleagues reported the estimated global value of ecosystem
services (not captured in traditional markets) at an average of $33 trillion
annually.[110]
Since the stone_age, species loss has accelerated above the average basal rate,
driven by human activity. Estimates of species losses are at a rate 100-10,000
times as fast as is typical in the fossil record.[111] Biodiversity also
affords many non-material benefits including spiritual and aesthetic values,
knowledge systems and education.[111]
**** Agriculture[edit] ****
See also: Agricultural_biodiversity
Amazon_Rainforest in South_America
Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: intraspecific
diversity, which includes the genetic variety within a single species, like the
potato (Solanum_tuberosum) that is composed of many different forms and types
(e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or
purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, S.
tuberosum).
The other category of agricultural diversity is called interspecific_diversity
and refers to the number and types of different species. Thinking about this
diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different
crops like potatoes and also carrots, peppers, lettuce etc.
Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is âplannedâ
diversity or âassociatedâ diversity. This is a functional classification
that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned
diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised
(e.g. crops, covers, symbionts and livestock, among others), which can be
contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops,
uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others).[112]
The control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural
challenges that farmers face. On monoculture farms, the approach is generally
to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive
pesticides, mechanized tools and transgenic_engineering_techniques, then to
rotate_crops. Although some polyculture farmers use the same techniques, they
also employ integrated_pest_management strategies as well as strategies that
are more labor-intensive, but generally less dependent on capital,
biotechnology and energy.
Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in
what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single
species, also offers us choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture,
we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a
wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the
next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in
that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific
diversity. Even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures,
relies on biodiversity at some point.
    * The Irish_potato_blight of 1846 was a major factor in the deaths of one
      million people and the emigration of about two million. It was the result
      of planting only two potato varieties, both vulnerable to the blight,
      Phytophthora_infestans, which arrived in 1845[112]
    * When rice_grassy_stunt_virus struck rice fields from Indonesia to India
      in the 1970s, 6,273 varieties were tested for resistance.[113] Only one
      was resistant, an Indian variety and known to science only since 1966.
      [113] This variety formed a hybrid with other varieties and is now widely
      grown.[113]
    * Coffee_rust attacked coffee plantations in Sri_Lanka, Brazil and Central
      America in 1970. A resistant variety was found in Ethiopia.[114] The
      diseases are themselves a form of biodiversity.
Monoculture was a contributing factor to several agricultural disasters,
including the European wine industry collapse in the late 19th century and the
US southern_corn_leaf_blight epidemic of 1970.[115]
Although about 80 percent of humans' food supply comes from just 20 kinds of
plants,[citation_needed][116] humans use at least 40,000 species.[citation
needed][117] Many people depend on these species for food, shelter and
clothing.[citation_needed] Earth's surviving biodiversity provides resources
for increasing the range of food and other products suitable for human use,
although the present extinction rate shrinks that potential.[89]
**** Human health[edit] ****
The diverse forest canopy on Barro_Colorado_Island, Panama, yielded this
display of different fruit
Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political
issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of
biodiversity loss.[118][119] [120] This issue is closely linked with the issue
of climate_change,[121] as many of the anticipated health risks of climate
change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations
and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on
agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species
most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease
transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease
transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus,
according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard
College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson
Center_for_a_Sustainable_Future (ACSF) at Cornell_University.[122]
The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an
additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in
the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups
promoting preservation of water resources.[123] While the distribution of clean
water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to
the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a
safely managed drinking-water service.[124]
Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and
nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal
resources, social and psychological health.[125] Biodiversity is also known to
have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief
and recovery efforts.[126][127]
Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability
of medicinal resources.[128][129] A significant proportion of drugs are
derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the
pharmaceutical compounds on the US market are derived from plants, animals and
micro-organisms, while about 80% of the world population depends on medicines
from nature (used in either modern or traditional medical practice) for primary
healthcare.[119] Only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for
medical potential. Biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the
field of bionics. Evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science
indicates that the decline in output from the pharmaceutical sector since the
mid-1980s can be attributed to a move away from natural product exploration
("bioprospecting") in favor of genomics and synthetic chemistry, indeed claims
about the value of undiscovered pharmaceuticals may not provide enough
incentive for companies in free markets to search for them because of the high
cost of development;[130] meanwhile, natural products have a long history of
supporting significant economic and health innovation.[131][132] Marine
ecosystems are particularly important,[133] although inappropriate
bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss, as well as violating the laws of
the communities and states from which the resources are taken.[134][135][136]
**** Business and industry[edit] ****
Agriculture production, pictured is a tractor and a chaser_bin
Many industrial materials derive directly from biological sources. These
include building materials, fibers, dyes, rubber and oil. Biodiversity is also
important to the security of resources such as water, timber, paper, fiber and
food.[137][138][139] As a result, biodiversity loss is a significant risk
factor in business development and a threat to long term economic
sustainability.[140][141]
**** Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value[edit] ****
Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as hiking, birdwatching or
natural history study. Biodiversity inspires musicians, painters, sculptors,
writers and other artists. Many cultures view themselves as an integral part of
the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms.
Popular activities such as gardening, fishkeeping and specimen collecting
strongly depend on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such
pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the majority do not enter
commerce.
The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic
animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators
and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly
understood. The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual
organisms, reflecting their inherent value.
Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic
and spiritual value to mankind in and of itself. This idea can be used as a
counterweight to the notion that tropical_forests and other ecological realms
are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.[142]
**** Ecological services[edit] ****
See also: Ecological_effects_of_biodiversity
Eagle_Creek, Oregon hiking
Biodiversity supports many ecosystem_services:
     "There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the
     efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically
     essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle
     biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that
     biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through
     time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain
     key species that have a large influence on productivity and
     differences in functional traits among organisms increase total
     resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological
     processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many
     other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple
     ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher
     levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place
     and time."[92]
It plays a part in regulating the chemistry of our atmosphere and water_supply.
Biodiversity is directly involved in water_purification, recycling nutrients
and providing fertile soils. Experiments with controlled environments have
shown that humans cannot easily build ecosystems to support human needs;[143]
for example insect_pollination cannot be mimicked, though there have been
attempts to create artificial pollinators using unmanned_aerial_vehicles.[144]
The economic activity of pollination alone represented between $2.1-14.6
billions in 2003.[145]
***** Number of species[edit] *****
Main article: Global_biodiversity
Discovered and predicted total number of species on land and in the oceans
According to Mora and colleagues, the total number of terrestrial species is
estimated to be around 8.7 million while the number of oceanic species is much
lower, estimated at 2.2 million. The authors note that these estimates are
strongest for eukaryotic organisms and likely represent the lower bound of
prokaryote diversity.[146] Other estimates include:
    * 220,000 vascular_plants, estimated using the species-area relation method
      [147]
    * 0.7-1 million marine species[148]
    * 10â30 million insects;[149] (of some 0.9 million we know today)[150]
    * 5â10 million bacteria;[151]
    * 1.5-3 million fungi, estimates based on data from the tropics, long-term
      non-tropical sites and molecular studies that have revealed cryptic
      speciation.[152] Some 0.075 million species of fungi had been documented
      by 2001)[153]
    * 1 million mites[154]
    * The number of microbial species is not reliably known, but the Global
      Ocean_Sampling_Expedition dramatically increased the estimates of genetic
      diversity by identifying an enormous number of new genes from near-
      surface plankton samples at various marine locations, initially over the
      2004-2006 period.[155] The findings may eventually cause a significant
      change in the way science defines species and other taxonomic categories.
      [156][157]
Since the rate of extinction has increased, many extant species may become
extinct before they are described.[158] Not surprisingly, in the animalia the
most studied groups are birds and mammals, whereas fishes and arthropods are
the least studied animals groups.[159]
***** Measuring biodiversity[edit] *****
Main articles: diversity_index and measurement_of_biodiversity
***** Species loss rates[edit] *****
Further information: Loss_of_biodiversity
     No longer do we have to justify the existence of humid tropical
     forests on the feeble grounds that they might carry plants with drugs
     that cure human disease. Gaia_theory forces us to see that they offer
     much more than this. Through their capacity to evapotranspirate vast
     volumes of water vapor, they serve to keep the planet cool by wearing
     a sunshade of white reflecting cloud. Their replacement by cropland
     could precipitate a disaster that is global in scale.
During the last century, decreases in biodiversity have been increasingly
observed. In 2007, German Federal Environment Minister Sigmar_Gabriel cited
estimates that up to 30% of all species will be extinct by 2050.[160] Of these,
about one eighth of known plant species are threatened with extinction.[161]
Estimates reach as high as 140,000 species per year (based on Species-area
theory).[162] This figure indicates unsustainable ecological practices, because
few species emerge each year.[citation_needed] Almost all scientists
acknowledge that the rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in
human history, with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher
than background_extinction rates.[161] As of 2012, some studies suggest that
25% of all mammal species could be extinct in 20 years.[163]
In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970
according to a 2016 study by the World_Wildlife_Fund. The Living Planet Report
2014 claims that "the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish
across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago". Of
that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine
wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the
biggest hit in Latin_America, plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries
showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-
income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five
times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as
a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource_depletion
to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.[164]
A 2017 study published in PLOS_One found that the biomass of insect life in
Germany had declined by three-quarters in the last 25 years. Dave Goulson of
Sussex_University stated that their study suggested that humans "appear to be
making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are
currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then
everything is going to collapse."[165]
***** Threats[edit] *****
In 2006, many species were formally classified as rare or endangered or
threatened; moreover, scientists have estimated that millions more species are
at risk which have not been formally recognized. About 40 percent of the 40,177
species assessed using the IUCN_Red_List criteria are now listed as threatened
with extinctionâa total of 16,119.[166]
Jared_Diamond describes an "Evil Quartet" of habitat_destruction, overkill,
introduced species and secondary extinctions.[167] Edward_O._Wilson prefers the
acronym HIPPO, standing for Habitat destruction, Invasive species, Pollution,
human over-Population and Over-harvesting.[168][169] The most authoritative
classification in use today is IUCN's Classification of Direct Threats[170]
(version 2.0 released in 2016) which has been adopted by major international
conservation organizations such as the US Nature_Conservancy, the World
Wildlife_Fund, Conservation_International and BirdLife_International.
The 11 main direct threats to conservation are:
1. residential & commercial development
          * housing & urban areas (urban areas, suburbs, villages, vacation
            homes, shopping areas, offices, schools, hospitals)
          * commercial & industrial areas (manufacturing plants, shopping
            centers, office parks, military bases, power plants, train & ship
            yards, airports)
          * tourism & recreational areas (skiing, golf courses, sports fields,
            parks, campgrounds)
2. farming activities

          * non-renewable energy production (oil and gas drilling)
          * mining (fuel and minerals)
4. transportation & service corridors
          * service corridors (electrical & phone wires, aqueducts, oil & gas
            pipelines)
          * transport corridors (roads, railroads, shipping lanes, and flight
            paths)
          * collisions with the vehicles using the corridors
          * associated accidents and catastrophes (oil spills, electrocution,
            fire)
5. biological resource usages
          * hunting (bushmeat, trophy, fur)
          * persecution (predator control and pest control, superstitions)
          * plant destruction or removal (human consumption, free range
            livestock foraging, battling timber disease, orchid collection)
          * logging or wood harvesting (selective or clear cutting, firewood
            collection, charcoal production)
          * fishing (trawling, whaling, live coral or seaweed or egg
            collection)
6. human intrusions & activities that alter, destroy, simply disturb habitats
and species from exhibiting natural behaviors

            mountain bikes, hikers, birdwatchers, skiers, pets in recreational
            areas, temporary campsites, caving, rock-climbing)
          * war, civil unrest, & military exercises (armed conflict, mine
            fields, tanks & other military vehicles, training exercises &
            ranges, defoliation, munitions testing)
          * illegal activities (smuggling, immigration, vandalism)

            management, escaped agricultural and campfires, arson)
          * water management (dam construction & operation, wetland filling,
            surface water diversion, groundwater pumping)
          * other modifications (reclamation projects, shoreline rip-rap, lawn
            cultivation, beach construction and maintenance, tree-thinning in
            parks)
          * removing/reducing human maintenance (mowing meadows, reduction in
            controlled burns, lack of indigenous management of key ecosystems,
            ceasing supplemental feeding of condors)
8. invasive & problematic species, pathogens & genes
          * invasive species (feral horses & household pets, zebra mussels,
            Miconia tree, kudzu, introduction for biocontrol)

            drowning of coral reefs from sea level rise, sand dune encroachment
            from desertification)
          * changes in geochemical regimes (ocean acidification, changes in
            atmospheric CO2 affecting plant growth, loss of sediment leading to
            broad-scale subsidence)

          * severe weather events (thunderstorms, tropical storms, hurricanes,
            cyclones, tornadoes, hailstorms, ice storms or blizzards, dust
            storms, erosion of beaches during storms)
**** Habitat destruction[edit] ****
Deforestation and increased road-building in the Amazon_Rainforest cause
significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas,
increased resource extraction and further threats to biodiversity.
Main article: Habitat_destruction
Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in
relation to tropical_forest destruction.[171] Factors contributing to habitat
loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land_use_change, deforestation,
[172] pollution (air_pollution, water_pollution, soil_contamination) and global
warming or climate change.[citation_needed]
Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically
larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are
more sensitive to reduction in habitat area.[173] Conversion to "trivial"
standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively
destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion.
Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity â through clearing/
draining land, discouraging weeds and "pests", and encouraging just a limited
set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of
property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to
biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).
[citation_needed]
A 2007 study conducted by the National_Science_Foundation found that
biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependentâthat diversity among
species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. "If any one type is
removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes
dominated by a single species."[174] At present[update], the most threatened
ecosystems occur in fresh_water, according to the Millennium_Ecosystem
Assessment 2005, which was confirmed by the "Freshwater Animal Diversity
Assessment" organised by the biodiversity_platform and the French Institut_de
recherche_pour_le_dÃ©veloppement (MNHNP).[175]
Co-extinctions are a form of habitat_destruction. Co-extinction occurs when the
extinction or decline in one species accompanies similar processes in another,
such as in plants and beetles.[176]
A 2019 report has revealed that bees and other pollinating insects have been
wiped out of almost a quarter of their habitats across the United Kingdom. The
population crashes have been happening since 1980s and are affecting the
biodiversity. The increase in industrial farming and pesticide use, combined
with disease, invasive species and climate change is threatening the future of
these insects and the agriculture they support.[177]
**** Introduced and invasive species[edit] ****
Main articles: Introduced_species and Invasive_species
Male Lophura nycthemera (silver_pheasant), a native of East_Asia that has been
introduced into parts of Europe for ornamental reasons
Barriers such as large rivers, seas, oceans, mountains and deserts encourage
diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via
the process of allopatric_speciation. The term invasive_species is applied to
species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them
constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often
supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources
that would normally sustain native species.
The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the
beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on
purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic
changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald
ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American
Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive
in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance.
[178] Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that
species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously
[179] while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist
invasive plants and animals.[180] An important question is, "do invasive
species cause extinctions?" Many studies cite effects of invasive species on
natives,[181] but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local
(i.e.: alpha_diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.:
beta_diversity). Overall gamma_diversity may be lowered because species are
going extinct because of other causes,[182] but even some of the most insidious
invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North
America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation,
population_decline and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more
common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species
circumventing their barriers,[183] by introducing them for food and other
purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and
thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically
have been required for a species to extend its range.
Not all introduced species are invasive, nor all invasive species deliberately
introduced. In cases such as the zebra_mussel, invasion of US waterways was
unintentional. In other cases, such as mongooses in Hawaii, the introduction is
deliberate but ineffective (nocturnal rats were not vulnerable to the diurnal
mongoose). In other cases, such as oil_palms in Indonesia and Malaysia, the
introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are
accompanied by costly unintended_consequences.
Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that
depends on the species it replaces. In Belgium, Prunus_spinosa from Eastern
Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts, disrupting the
feeding habits of the Thecla_betulae butterfly (which feeds on the leaves).
Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to
compete with the exotic species and unable to survive. The exotic organisms may
be predators, parasites, or may simply outcompete indigenous species for
nutrients, water and light.
At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species,
particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their own indigenous
fauna/flora may be outnumbered. For example, the introduction of kudzu from
Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in
certain areas.[184]
*** Genetic pollution[edit] ***
Main article: Genetic_pollution
Endemic species can be threatened with extinction[185] through the process of
genetic_pollution, i.e. uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic
swamping. Genetic pollution leads to homogenization or replacement of local
genomes as a result of either a numerical and/or fitness advantage of an
introduced species.[186] Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of
introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to
rare_species that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant
species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its gene_pool. This
problem is not always apparent from morphological (outward appearance)
observations alone. Some degree of gene_flow is normal adaptation and not all
gene and genotype constellations can be preserved. However, hybridization with
or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence.
[187][188]
**** Overexploitation[edit] ****
Main article: Overexploitation
Overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate.
This occurs on land in the form of overhunting, excessive logging, poor soil
conservation in agriculture and the illegal wildlife_trade.
About 25% of world fisheries are now overfished to the point where their
current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.
[189]
The overkill_hypothesis, a pattern of large animal extinctions connected with
human_migration patterns, can be used explain why megafaunal extinctions can
occur within a relatively short time period.[190]
**** Hybridization, genetic pollution/erosion and food security[edit] ****
The Yecoro wheat (right) cultivar is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting
from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high
salinity
See also: Food_security and Genetic_erosion
In agriculture and animal_husbandry, the Green_Revolution popularized the use
of conventional hybridization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds
originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local
varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to
local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing
hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds
have collapsed causing widespread genetic_erosion and genetic pollution. This
has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole.[191]
Genetically_modified_organisms contain genetic material that is altered through
genetic_engineering. Genetically_modified_crops have become a common source for
genetic pollution in not only wild varieties, but also in domesticated
varieties derived from classical hybridization.[192][193][194][195][196]
Genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique
genotypes, threatening future access to food_security. A decrease in genetic
diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist
disease and survive changes in climate.[191]
**** Climate change[edit] ****
Main article: Effect_of_climate_change_on_plant_biodiversity
Polar_bears on the sea ice of the Arctic_Ocean, near the North_Pole. Climate
change has started affecting bear populations.
Global warming is also considered to be a major potential threat to global
biodiversity in the future.[197][198] For example, coral reefs â which are
biodiversity hotspots â will be lost within the century if global warming
continues at the current trend.[199][200]
Climate change has seen many claims about potential to affect biodiversity but
evidence supporting the statement is tenuous. Increasing atmospheric carbon
dioxide certainly affects plant morphology[201] and is acidifying oceans,[202]
and temperature affects species ranges,[203][204][205] phenology,[206] and
weather,[207] but the major impacts that have been predicted are still just
potential impacts. We have not documented major extinctions yet, even as
climate change drastically alters the biology of many species.
In 2004, an international collaborative study on four continents estimated that
10 percent of species would become extinct by 2050 because of global warming.
"We need to limit climate change or we wind up with a lot of species in
trouble, possibly extinct," said Dr. Lee Hannah, a co-author of the paper and
chief climate change biologist at the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science
at Conservation International.[208]
A recent study predicts that up to 35% of the world terrestrial carnivores and
ungulates will be at higher risk of extinction by 2050 because of the joint
effects of predicted climate and land-use change under business-as-usual human
development scenarios.[209]
**** Human overpopulation[edit] ****
Main article: Human_overpopulation
The world's population numbered nearly 7.6 billion as of mid-2017 (which is
approximately one billion more inhabitants compared to 2005) and is forecast to
reach 11.1 billion in 2100.[210] Sir David_King, former chief scientific
adviser to the UK government, told a parliamentary inquiry: "It is self-evident
that the massive growth in the human_population through the 20th century has
had more impact on biodiversity than any other single factor."[211][212] At
least until the middle of the 21st century, worldwide losses of pristine
biodiverse land will probably depend much on the worldwide human_birth_rate.
[213] Biologists such as Paul_R._Ehrlich and Stuart_Pimm have noted that human
population_growth and overconsumption are the main drivers of species
extinction.[214][215][216]
According to a 2014 study by the World_Wildlife_Fund, the global human
population already exceeds planet's biocapacity â it would take the
equivalent of 1.5 Earths of biocapacity to meet our current demands.[217] The
report further points that if everyone on the planet had the Footprint of the
average resident of Qatar, we would need 4.8 Earths and if we lived the
lifestyle of a typical resident of the US, we would need 3.9 Earths.[164]
***** The Holocene extinction[edit] *****
Main article: Holocene_extinction
Rates of decline in biodiversity in this sixth mass extinction match or exceed
rates of loss in the five previous mass_extinction_events in the fossil_record.
[218][219][220][221][222][223][224] Loss of biodiversity results in the loss of
natural_capital that supplies ecosystem_goods_and_services. From the
perspective of the method known as Natural Economy the economic value of 17
ecosystem services for Earth's biosphere (calculated in 1997) has an estimated
value of US$33 trillion (3.3x1013) per year.[225]
***** Conservation[edit] *****
Main article: Conservation_biology
A schematic image illustrating the relationship between biodiversity, ecosystem
services, human well-being and poverty.[226] The illustration shows where
conservation action, strategies and plans can influence the drivers of the
current biodiversity crisis at local, regional, to global scales.
The retreat of Aletsch_Glacier in the Swiss_Alps (situation in 1979, 1991 and
2002), due to global_warming.
Conservation_biology matured in the mid-20th century as ecologists, naturalists
and other scientists began to research and address issues pertaining to global
biodiversity declines.[227][228][229]
The conservation ethic advocates management of natural_resources for the
purpose of sustaining biodiversity in species, ecosystems, the evolutionary
process and human culture and society.[219][227][229][230][231]
Conservation biology is reforming around strategic plans to protect
biodiversity.[227][232][233] Preserving global biodiversity is a priority in
strategic conservation plans that are designed to engage public policy and
concerns affecting local, regional and global scales of communities, ecosystems
and cultures.[234] Action plans identify ways of sustaining human well-being,
employing natural_capital, market_capital and ecosystem_services.[235][236]
In the EU_Directive_1999/22/EC zoos are described as having a role in the
preservation of the biodiversity of wildlife animals by conducting research or
participation in breeding_programs.[237]
**** Protection and restoration techniques[edit] ****
Removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively
impacted to recover their ecological niches. Exotic species that have become
pests can be identified taxonomically (e.g., with Digital_Automated
Identification_SYstem (DAISY), using the barcode_of_life).[238][239] Removal is
practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost.
As sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become
assured, "missing" species that are candidates for reintroduction can be
identified using databases such as the Encyclopedia_of_Life and the Global
Biodiversity_Information_Facility.
    * Biodiversity_banking places a monetary value on biodiversity. One example
      is the Australian Native_Vegetation_Management_Framework.
    * Gene_banks are collections of specimens and genetic material. Some banks
      intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem (e.g., via tree
      nurseries).[240]
    * Reduction and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to
      survive in agricultural and urbanized areas.
    * Location-specific approaches may be less useful for protecting migratory
      species. One approach is to create wildlife_corridors that correspond to
      the animals' movements. National and other boundaries can complicate
      corridor creation.[citation_needed]
***** Protected areas[edit] *****

Protected areas are meant for affording protection to wild animals and their
habitat which also includes forest reserves and biosphere reserves.[241]
Protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of
protecting and conserving plants and animals. Some scientists have called on
the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet
by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate biodiversity loss from
anthropogenic causes.[242]
**** National parks[edit] ****
Main article: National_park
National park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private
organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the
objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation. National parks are
usually owned and managed by national or state governments. A limit is placed
on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas. Designated
trails or roads are created. The visitors are allowed to enter only for study,
cultural and recreation purposes. Forestry operations, grazing of animals and
hunting of animals are regulated. Exploitation of habitat or wildlife is
banned.
**** Wildlife sanctuary[edit] ****
Wildlife_sanctuaries aim only at conservation of species and have the following
features:
   1. The boundaries of the sanctuaries are not limited by state legislation.
   2. The killing, hunting or capturing of any species is prohibited except by
      or under the control of the highest authority in the department which is
      responsible for the management of the sanctuary.
   3. Private ownership may be allowed.
   4. Forestry and other usages can also be permitted.
**** Forest reserves[edit] ****
The forests play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000
faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic.
[citation_needed] Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical
area are called endemic species. In reserved forests, rights to activities like
hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of
the forest, who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest
resources or products. The unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total
forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics:
   1. They are large inaccessible forests.
   2. Many of these are unoccupied.
   3. They are ecologically and economically less important.
*** Steps to conserve the forest cover[edit] ***
Further information: forest_cover
   1. An extensive reforestation/afforestation programme should be followed.
   2. Alternative environment-friendly sources of fuel energy such as biogas
      other than wood should be used.
   3. Loss of biodiversity due to forest_fire is a major problem, immediate
      steps to prevent forest fire need to be taken.
   4. Overgrazing by cattle can damage a forest seriously. Therefore, certain
      steps should be taken to prevent overgrazing by cattle.
   5. Hunting and poaching should be banned.
**** Zoological parks[edit] ****
In zoological_parks or zoos, live animals are kept for public recreation,
education and conservation purposes. Modern zoos offer veterinary facilities,
provide opportunities for threatened species to breed_in_captivity and usually
build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their
care. Zoos play a major role in creating awareness about the need to conserve
nature.
**** Botanical gardens[edit] ****
In botanical_gardens, plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific
and educational purposes. They consist of a collection of living plants, grown
outdoors or under glass in greenhouses and conservatories. In addition, a
botanical garden may include a collection of dried plants or herbarium and such
facilities as lecture rooms, laboratories, libraries, museums and experimental
or research plantings.
***** Resource allocation[edit] *****
Focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater
immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on
areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity.[243]
A second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original
diversity, which typically require little or no restoration. These are
typically non-urbanized, non-agricultural areas. Tropical areas often fit both
criteria, given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development.
[244]
***** Legal status[edit] *****
A great deal of work is occurring to preserve the natural characteristics of
Hopetoun_Falls, Australia while continuing to allow visitor access.
**** International[edit] ****
    * United Nations Convention_on_Biological_Diversity (1992) and Cartagena
      Protocol_on_Biosafety;
    * Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES);
    * Ramsar_Convention (Wetlands);
    * Bonn_Convention on Migratory Species;
    * World_Heritage_Convention (indirectly by protecting biodiversity
      habitats)
    * Regional Conventions such as the Apia Convention
    * Bilateral agreements such as the Japan-Australia_Migratory_Bird
      Agreement.
Global agreements such as the Convention_on_Biological_Diversity, give
"sovereign national rights over biological resources" (not property). The
agreements commit countries to "conserve biodiversity", "develop resources for
sustainability" and "share the benefits" resulting from their use. Biodiverse
countries that allow bioprospecting or collection of natural products, expect a
share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that
discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately. Bioprospecting can
become a type of biopiracy when such principles are not respected.[citation
needed]
Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as Access_and_Benefit
Sharing_Agreements (ABAs). The Convention on Biodiversity implies informed
consent between the source country and the collector, to establish which
resource will be used and for what and to settle on a fair_agreement_on_benefit
sharing.
**** National level laws[edit] ****
Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions:
    * The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has
      consequences for biodiversity. It is related to private and public
      property rights. It can define protection for threatened ecosystems, but
      also some rights and duties (for example, fishing and hunting rights).
      [citation_needed]
    * Law regarding species is more recent. It defines species that must be
      protected because they may be threatened by extinction. The U.S.
      Endangered_Species_Act is an example of an attempt to address the "law
      and species" issue.
    * Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old.[citation_needed]
      Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new, but advances in
      genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of
      genetically_modified_organisms, gene patents and process patents.[245]
      Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example, genes,
      genomes, or organisms and species.[citation_needed]
Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been
achieved, however. Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a
legal standard, claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty
cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without
promoting preservation goals.[246]
India passed the Biological_Diversity_Act in 2002 for the conservation of
biological diversity in India. The Act also provides mechanisms for equitable
sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and
knowledge.
***** Analytical limits[edit] *****
**** Taxonomic and size relationships[edit] ****
Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond
simply noting their existence.[247] The vast majority of Earth's species are
microbial. Contemporary biodiversity physics is "firmly fixated on the visible
[macroscopic] world".[248] For example, microbial life is metabolically and
environmentally more diverse than multicellular life (see e.g., extremophile).
"On the tree of life, based on analyses of small-subunit ribosomal_RNA, visible
life consists of barely noticeable twigs. The inverse relationship of size and
population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladderâto a first approximation,
all multicellular species on Earth are insects".[249] Insect_extinction rates
are highâsupporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis.[250][251]
***** Diversity study (botany)[edit] *****
The number of morphological attributes that can be scored for diversity study
is generally limited and prone to environmental influences; thereby reducing
the fine resolution required to ascertain the phylogenetic relationships. DNA
based markers- microsatellites otherwise known as simple sequence repeats (SSR)
were therefore used for the diversity studies of certain species and their wild
relatives.
In the case of cowpea, a study conducted to assess the level of genetic
diversity in cowpea germplasm and related wide species, where the relatedness
among various taxa were compared, primers useful for classification of taxa
identified, and the origin and phylogeny of cultivated cowpea classified show
that SSR markers are useful in validating with species classification and
revealing the center of diversity.[252]
