English grammar is the way in which meanings are encoded into wordings in the
English_language. This includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses, and
sentences, right up to the structure of whole texts.
There are historical, social, cultural and regional variations of English.
Divergences from the grammar described here occur in some dialects. This
article describes a generalized present-day Standard_English â a form of
speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting, education,
entertainment, government, and news, over a range of registers from formal to
informal. There are differences in grammar between the standard forms of
British, American, and Australian_English, although these are more minor than
differences in vocabulary and pronunciation.
Modern_English has largely abandoned the inflectional case_system of Indo-
European in favor of analytic constructions. The personal_pronouns retain
morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant of the
more extensive Germanic case_system_of_Old_English). For other pronouns, and
all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by
word_order, by prepositions, and by the "Saxon_genitive or English_possessive"
(-'s).[1]
Eight "word_classes"_or_"parts_of_speech" are commonly distinguished in
English: nouns, determiners, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
prepositions, and conjunctions. Nouns form the largest word class, and verbs
the second-largest. Unlike many Indo-European languages, English nouns do not
have grammatical_gender.

***** Word classes and phrases[edit] *****
Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs form open_classes â word classes that
readily accept new members, such as the noun celebutante (a celebrity who
frequents the fashion circles), and other similar relatively new words.[2] The
others are considered to be closed_classes. For example, it is rare for a new
pronoun to enter the language. Determiners, traditionally classified along with
adjectives, have not always been regarded as a separate part of speech.
Interjections are another word class, but these are not described here as they
do not form part of the clause and sentence structure of the language.[2]
English words are not generally marked for word class. It is not usually
possible to tell from the form of a word which class it belongs to except, to
some extent, in the case of words with inflectional endings or derivational
suffixes. On the other hand, most words belong to more than one word class. For
example, run can serve as either a verb or a noun (these are regarded as two
different lexemes).[3] Lexemes may be inflected to express different
grammatical categories. The lexeme run has the forms runs, ran, runny, runner,
and running.[3] Words in one class can sometimes be derived from those in
another. This has the potential to give rise to new words. The noun aerobics
has recently given rise to the adjective aerobicized.[3]
Words combine to form phrases. A phrase typically serves the same function as a
word from some particular word class.[3] For example, my very good friend Peter
is a phrase that can be used in a sentence as if it were a noun, and is
therefore called a noun_phrase. Similarly, adjectival_phrases and adverbial
phrases function as if they were adjectives or adverbs, but with other types of
phrases the terminology has different implications. For example, a verb_phrase
consists of a verb together with any objects and other dependents; a
prepositional_phrase consists of a preposition and its complement (and is
therefore usually a type of adverbial phrase); and a determiner_phrase is a
type of noun phrase containing a determiner.
**** Nouns[edit] ****
There are many common suffixes used to form nouns from other nouns or from
other types of words, such as -age (as in shrinkage), -hood (as in sisterhood),
and so on,[3] although many nouns are base forms not containing any such suffix
(such as cat, grass, France). Nouns are also often created by conversion of
verbs or adjectives, as with the words talk and reading (a boring talk, the
assigned reading).
Nouns are sometimes classified semantically (by their meanings) as proper_nouns
and_common_nouns (Cyrus, China vs. frog, milk) or as concrete_nouns_and
abstract_nouns (book, laptop vs. heat, prejudice).[4] A grammatical distinction
is often made between count_(countable)_nouns such as clock and city, and non-
count_(uncountable)_nouns such as milk and decor.[5] Some nouns can function
both as countable and as uncountable such as the word "wine" (This is a good
wine, I prefer red wine).
Countable nouns generally have singular and plural forms.[4] In most cases the
plural is formed from the singular by adding -[e]s (as in dogs, bushes),
although there are also irregular forms (woman/women, foot/feet, etc.),
including cases where the two forms are identical (sheep, series). For more
details, see English_plural. Certain nouns can be used with plural verbs even
though they are singular in form, as in The government were ... (where the
government is considered to refer to the people constituting the government).
This is a form of synesis; it is more common in British than American English.
See English_plural_Â§ Singulars_with_collective_meaning_treated_as_plural.
English nouns are not marked for case as they are in some languages, but they
have possessive forms, through the addition of -'s (as in John's, children's)
or just an apostrophe (with no change in pronunciation) in the case of -[e]s
plurals and sometimes other words ending with -s (the dogs' owners, Jesus'
love). More generally, the ending can be applied to noun phrases (as in the man
you saw yesterday's sister); see below. The possessive form can be used either
as a determiner (John's cat) or as a noun phrase (John's is the one next to
Jane's).
The status_of_the_possessive as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate.
[6][7] It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that
the genitive ending may attach to the last word of the phrase. To account for
this, the possessive can be analysed, for instance as a clitic construction (an
"enclitic postposition"[8]) or as an inflection[9][10] of the last word of a
phrase ("edge inflection").
*** Phrases[edit] ***
Noun_phrases are phrases that function grammatically as nouns within sentences,
for example as the subject or object of a verb. Most noun phrases have a noun
as their head.[5]
An English noun phrase typically takes the following form (not all elements
need be present):
      Determiner + Pre-modifiers + NOUN + Postmodifiers/Complement
In this structure:
    * the determiner may be an article (the, a[n]) or other equivalent word, as
      described in the following section. In many contexts it is required for a
      noun phrase to include some determiner.
    * pre-modifiers include adjectives and some adjective phrases (such as red,
      really lovely), and noun_adjuncts (such as college in the phrase the
      college student). Adjectival modifiers usually come before noun adjuncts.
    * a complement or postmodifier[5] may be a prepositional phrase (... of
      London), a relative_clause (like ...which we saw yesterday), certain
      adjective or participial phrases (... sitting on the beach), or a
      dependent_clause or infinitive_phrase appropriate to the noun (like ...
      that the world is round after a noun such as fact or statement, or ... to
      travel widely after a noun such as desire).
An example of a noun phrase that includes all of the above-mentioned elements
is that rather attractive young college student to whom you were talking. Here
that is the determiner, rather attractive and young are adjectival pre-
modifiers, college is a noun adjunct, student is the noun serving as the head
of the phrase, and to whom you were talking is a post-modifier (a relative
clause in this case). Notice the order of the pre-modifiers; the determiner
that must come first and the noun adjunct college must come after the
adjectival modifiers.
Coordinating conjunctions such as and, or, and but can be used at various
levels in noun phrases, as in John, Paul, and Mary; the matching green coat and
hat; a dangerous but exciting ride; a person sitting down or standing up. See
Â§ Conjunctions below for more explanation.
Noun phrases can also be placed in apposition (where two consecutive phrases
refer to the same thing), as in that president, Abraham Lincoln, ... (where
that president and Abraham Lincoln are in apposition). In some contexts the
same can be expressed by a prepositional phrase, as in the twin curses of
famine and pestilence (meaning "the twin curses" that are "famine and
pestilence").
Particular forms of noun phrases include:
    * phrases formed by the determiner the with an adjective, as in the
      homeless, the English (these are plural phrases referring to homeless
      people or English people in general);
    * phrases with a pronoun rather than a noun as the head (see below);
    * phrases consisting just of a possessive;
    * infinitive and gerund phrases, in certain positions;
    * certain clauses, such as that clauses and relative_clauses like what he
      said, in certain positions.
*** Gender[edit] ***
Main article: Gender_in_English
A system of grammatical gender, whereby every noun was treated as either
masculine, feminine or neuter, existed in Old_English, but fell out of use
during the Middle_English period. Modern_English retains features relating to
natural_gender, namely the use of certain nouns and pronouns (such as he and
she) to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders and
certain others (such as it) for sexless objects â although feminine_pronouns
are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes
and analogous machinery) and nation states.
Some aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement
towards a preference for gender-neutral_language. Animals are triple-gender
nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns.[11]
Generally there is no difference between male and female in English nouns.
However, gender is occasionally exposed by different shapes or dissimilar words
when referring to people or animals.[12]
Masculine Feminine Gender neutral
man       woman    adult
boy       girl     child
husband   wife     spouse
actor     actress  -
rooster   hen      chicken
Many nouns that mention people's roles and jobs can refer to either a masculine
or a feminine subject, for instance "cousin", "teenager", "teacher", "doctor",
"student", "friend", and "colleague".[12]
    * Jane is my friend. She is a dentist.
    * Paul is my cousin. He is a dentist.
Often the gender distinction for these neutral nouns is established by
inserting the words "male" or "female".[12]
    * Sam is a female doctor.
    * No, he is not my boyfriend; he is just a male friend.
    * I have three female cousins and two male cousins.
Rarely, nouns illustrating things with no gender are referred to with a
gendered pronoun to convey familiarity. It is also standard to use the gender-
neutral pronoun (it).[12]
    * I love my car. She (the car) is my greatest passion.
    * France is popular with her (France's) neighbors at the moment.
    * I travelled from England to New York on the Queen Elizabeth; she (the
      Queen Elizabeth) is a great ship.
**** Determiners[edit] ****
Main articles: English_determiners and English_articles
English determiners constitute a relatively small class of words. They include
the articles the, a[n], certain demonstrative and interrogative words such as
this, that, and which, possessives such as my and whose (the role of determiner
can also be played by noun_possessive forms such as John's and the girl's),
various quantifying_words like all, some, many, various, and numerals (one,
two, etc.). There are also many phrases (such as a couple of) that can play the
role of determiners.
Determiners are used in the formation of noun phrases (see above). Many words
that serve as determiners can also be used as pronouns (this, that, many, etc.)
Determiners can be used in certain combinations, such as all the water and the
many problems.
In many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to be completed with an
article or some other determiner. It is not grammatical to say just cat sat on
table; one must say my cat sat on the table. The most common situations in
which a complete noun phrase can be formed without a determiner are when it
refers generally to a whole class or concept (as in dogs are dangerous and
beauty is subjective) and when it is a name (Jane, Spain, etc.) This is
discussed in more detail at English_articles and Zero_article_in_English.
**** Pronouns[edit] ****
Pronouns are a relatively small, closed class of words that function in the
place of nouns or noun phrases. They include personal_pronouns, demonstrative
pronouns, relative_pronouns, interrogative_pronouns, and some others, mainly
indefinite_pronouns.
*** Personal[edit] ***
Main article: English_personal_pronouns
The personal pronouns of modern standard English, and the corresponding
possessive forms, are as follows:
              Nominative     Oblique         Reflexive  Possessive Possessive
                                                        determiner pronoun
1st pers.     I              me              myself     my         mine
sing.
2nd pers.     you            you             yourself/  your       yours
sing./pl.                                    yourselves
                                             herself,
3rd pers.     she, he, they, her, him, them, himself,   her, his,  hers, his,
sing.         it             it              themself,  their, its theirs, its
                                             itself
1st pers. pl. we             us              ourselves  our        ours
3rd pers. pl. they           them            themselves their      theirs
The second-person forms such as you are used with both singular and plural
reference. In the Southern United States, y'all (you all) is used as a plural
form, and various other phrases such as you guys are used in other places. An
archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference is thou,
thee, thyself, thy, thine,which are still used in religious services and can be
seen in older works, such as Shakespeare's - in such texts, the you set of
pronouns are used for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal
V-form. You can also be used as an indefinite_pronoun, referring to a person in
general (see generic_you) compared to the more formal alternative, one
(reflexive oneself, possessive one's).
The third-person singular forms are differentiated according to the sex of the
referent. For example, she is used to refer to a female person, sometimes a
female animal, and sometimes an object to which female characteristics are
attributed, such as a ship or a country. A male person, and sometimes a male
animal, is referred to using he. In other cases it can be used. (See Gender_in
English.) The word it can also be used as a dummy_subject, in sentences like It
is going to be sunny this afternoon.
The third-person plural forms such as they are sometimes used with singular
reference, as a gender-neutral_pronoun, as in each employee should ensure they
tidy their desk. Despite its long history, this usage is sometimes considered
ungrammatical. (See singular_they.)
The possessive determiners such as my are used as determiners together with
nouns, as in my old man, some of his friends. The second possessive forms like
mine are used when they do not qualify a noun: as pronouns, as in mine is
bigger than yours, and as predicates, as in this one is mine. Note also the
construction a friend of mine (meaning "someone who is my friend"). See English
possessive for more details.
*** Demonstrative and interrogative[edit] ***
The demonstrative_pronouns of English are this (plural these), and that (plural
those), as in these are good, I like that. Note that all four words can also be
used as determiners (followed by a noun), as in those cars. They can also form
the alternative pronominal expressions this/that one, these/those ones.
The interrogative_pronouns are who, what, and which (all of them can take the
suffix -ever for emphasis). The pronoun who refers to a person or people; it
has an oblique form whom (though in informal contexts this is usually replaced
by who), and a possessive form (pronoun or determiner) whose. The pronoun what
refers to things or abstracts. The word which is used to ask about alternatives
from what is seen as a closed set: which (of the books) do you like best? (It
can also be an interrogative determiner: which book?; this can form the
alternative pronominal expressions which one and which ones.) Which, who, and
what can be either singular or plural, although who and what often take a
singular verb regardless of any supposed number. For more information see who.
All the interrogative pronouns can also be used as relative pronouns; see below
for more details.
*** Relative[edit] ***
Main article: English_relative_clauses
For "who/whom" and related forms, see Who_(pronoun).
The main relative_pronouns in English are who (with its derived forms whom and
whose), which, and that.[13]
The relative pronoun which refers to things rather than persons, as in the
shirt, which used to be red, is faded. For persons, who is used (the man who
saw me was tall). The oblique_case form of who is whom, as in the man whom I
saw was tall, although in informal registers who is commonly used in place of
whom.
The possessive form of who is whose (the man whose car is missing ...); however
the use of whose is not restricted to persons (one can say an idea whose time
has come).
The word that as a relative pronoun is normally found only in restrictive
relative_clauses (unlike which and who, which can be used in both restrictive
and unrestrictive clauses). It can refer to either persons or things, and
cannot follow a preposition. For example, one can say the song that [or which]
I listened to yesterday, but the song to which [not to that] I listened
yesterday. The relative pronoun that is usually pronounced with a reduced vowel
(schwa), and hence differently from the demonstrative that (see Weak_and_strong
forms_in_English). If that is not the subject of the relative clause, it can be
omitted (the song I listened to yesterday).
The word what can be used to form a free_relative_clause â one that has no
antecedent and that serves as a complete noun phrase in itself, as in I like
what he likes. The words whatever and whichever can be used similarly, in the
role of either pronouns (whatever he likes) or determiners (whatever book he
likes). When referring to persons, who(ever) (and whom(ever)) can be used in a
similar way (but not as determiners).
*** "There"[edit] ***
The word there is used as a pronoun in some sentences, playing the role of a
dummy_subject, normally of an intransitive_verb. The "logical subject" of the
verb then appears as a complement after the verb.
This use of there occurs most commonly with forms of the verb be in existential
clauses, to refer to the presence or existence of something. For example: There
is a heaven; There are two cups on the table; There have been a lot of problems
lately. It can also be used with other verbs: There exist two major variants;
There occurred a very strange incident.
The dummy subject takes the number (singular or plural) of the logical subject
(complement), hence it takes a plural verb if the complement is plural. In
informal English, however, the contraction there's is often used for both
singular and plural.[14]
The dummy subject can undergo inversion, Is there a test today? and Never has
there been a man such as this. It can also appear without a corresponding
logical subject, in short sentences and question_tags: There wasn't a
discussion, was there? There was.
The word there in such sentences has sometimes been analyzed as an adverb, or
as a dummy predicate, rather than as a pronoun.[15] However, its identification
as a pronoun is most consistent with its behavior in inverted sentences and
question tags as described above.
Because the word there can also be a deictic adverb (meaning "at/to that
place"), a sentence like There is a river could have either of two meanings: "a
river exists" (with there as a pronoun), and "a river is in that place" (with
there as an adverb). In speech, the adverbial there would be given stress,
while the pronoun would not â in fact the pronoun is often pronounced as a
weak_form, /Ã°É(r)/.
*** Other[edit] ***
Other pronouns in English are often identical in form to determiners
(especially quantifiers), such as many, a little, etc. Sometimes, the pronoun
form is different, as with none (corresponding to the determiner no), nothing,
everyone, somebody, etc. Many examples are listed as indefinite_pronouns.
Another indefinite (or impersonal) pronoun is one (with its reflexive form
oneself and possessive one's), which is a more formal alternative to generic
you.[16]
**** Verbs[edit] ****
Main article: English_verbs
The basic form of an English verb is not generally marked by any ending,
although there are certain suffixes that are frequently used to form verbs,
such as -ate (formulate), -fy (electrify), and -ise/ize (realise/realize).[17]
Many verbs also contain prefixes, such un- (unmask), out- (outlast), over-
(overtake), and under- (undervalue).[17] Verbs can also be formed from nouns
and adjectives by zero_derivation, as with the verbs snare, nose, dry, and
calm.
Most verbs have three or four inflected forms in addition to the base form: a
third-person singular present tense form in -(e)s (writes, botches), a present
participle and gerund form in -ing (writing), a past tense (wrote), and â
though often identical to the past tense form â a past_participle (written).
Regular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms in -ed, but
there are 100 or so irregular_English_verbs with different forms (see list).
The verbs have, do and say also have irregular third-person present tense forms
(has, does /dÊz/, says /sÉz/). The verb be has the largest number of
irregular forms (am, is, are in the present tense, was, were in the past tense,
been for the past participle).
Most of what are often referred to as verb tenses (or sometimes aspects) in
English are formed using auxiliary_verbs. Apart from what are called the simple
present (write, writes) and simple_past (wrote), there are also continuous
(progressive) forms (am/is/are/was/were writing), perfect forms (have/has/had
written, and the perfect continuous have/has/had been writing), future forms
(will write, will be writing, will have written, will have been writing), and
conditionals (also called "future in the past") with would in place of will.
The auxiliaries shall_and_should sometimes replace will and would in the first
person. For the uses of these various verb forms, see English_verbs and English
clause_syntax.
The basic form of the verb (be, write, play) is used as the infinitive,
although there is also a "to-infinitive" (to be, to write, to play) used in
many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to
other aspects: (to) have written, (to) be writing, (to) have been writing. The
second-person imperative is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other
imperative forms may be made with let (let us go, or let's go; let them eat
cake).
A form identical to the infinitive can be used as a present subjunctive in
certain contexts: It is important that he follow them or ... that he be
committed to the cause. There is also a past subjunctive (distinct from the
simple past only in the possible use of were instead of was), used in some
conditional sentences and similar: if I were (or was) rich ...; were he to
arrive now ...; I wish she were (or was) here. For details see English
subjunctive.
The passive_voice is formed using the verb be (in the appropriate tense or
form) with the past participle of the verb in question: cars are driven, he was
killed, I am being tickled, it is nice to be pampered, etc. The performer of
the action may be introduced in a prepositional phrase with by (as in they were
killed by the invaders).
The English_modal_verbs consist of the core modals can, could, may, might,
must, shall, should, will, would, as well as ought (to), had better, and in
some uses dare and need.[18] These do not inflect for person or number,[18] and
do not have infinitive or participle forms (except synonyms, as with be/being/
been able (to) for the modals can/could). The modals are used with the basic
infinitive form of a verb (I can swim, he may be killed, we dare not move, need
they go?), except for ought, which takes to (you ought to go).
The copula be, along with the modal verbs and the other auxiliaries, form a
distinct class, sometimes called "special_verbs" or simply "auxiliaries".[19]
These have different syntax from ordinary lexical_verbs, especially in that
they make their interrogative forms by plain inversion with the subject, and
their negative forms by adding not after the verb (could I ...? I could not
...). Apart from those already mentioned, this class may also include used to
(although the forms did he use to? and he didn't use to are also found), and
sometimes have even when not an auxiliary (forms like have you a sister? and he
hadn't a clue are possible, though becoming less common). It also includes the
auxiliary do (does, did); this is used with the basic infinitive of other verbs
(those not belonging to the "special verbs" class) to make their question and
negation forms, as well as emphatic forms (do I like you?; he doesn't speak
English; we did close the fridge). For more details of this, see do-support.
Some forms of the copula and auxiliaries often appear as contractions, as in
I'm for I am, you'd for you would or you had, and John's for John is. Their
negated forms with following not are also often contracted (see Â§ Negation
below). For detail see English_auxiliaries_and_contractions.
*** Phrases[edit] ***
A verb together with its dependents, excluding its subject, may be identified
as a verb_phrase (although this concept is not acknowledged in all theories of
grammar[20]). A verb phrase headed by a finite_verb may also be called a
predicate. The dependents may be objects, complements, and modifiers (adverbs
or adverbial_phrases). In English, objects and complements nearly always come
after the verb; a direct_object precedes other complements such as
prepositional phrases, but if there is an indirect_object as well, expressed
without a preposition, then that precedes the direct object: give me the book,
but give the book to me. Adverbial modifiers generally follow objects, although
other positions are possible (see under Â§ Adverbs below). Certain
verbâmodifier combinations, particularly when they have independent meaning
(such as take on and get up), are known as "phrasal_verbs".
For details of possible patterns, see English_clause_syntax. See the Non-finite
clauses section of that article for verb phrases headed by non-finite verb
forms, such as infinitives and participles.
**** Adjectives[edit] ****
English adjectives, as with other word classes, cannot in general be identified
as such by their form,[21] although many of them are formed from nouns or other
words by the addition of a suffix, such as -al (habitual), -ful (blissful), -ic
(atomic), -ish (impish, youngish), -ous (hazardous), etc.; or from other
adjectives using a prefix: disloyal, irredeemable, unforeseen, overtired.
Adjectives may be used attributively, as part of a noun phrase (nearly always
preceding the noun they modify; for exceptions see postpositive_adjective), as
in the big house, or predicatively, as in the house is big. Certain adjectives
are restricted to one or other use; for example, drunken is attributive (a
drunken sailor), while drunk is usually predicative (the sailor was drunk).
*** Comparison[edit] ***
Many adjectives have comparative and superlative forms in -er and -est,[22]
such as faster and fastest (from the positive form fast). Spelling rules which
maintain pronunciation apply to suffixing adjectives just as they do for
similar treatment of regular_past_tense_formation; these cover consonant
doubling (as in bigger and biggest, from big) and the change of y to i after
consonants (as in happier and happiest, from happy).
The adjectives good and bad have the irregular forms better, best and worse,
worst; also far becomes farther, farthest or further, furthest. The adjective
old (for which the regular older and oldest are usual) also has the irregular
forms elder and eldest, these generally being restricted to use in comparing
siblings and in certain independent uses. For the comparison of adverbs, see
Adverbs below.
Many adjectives, however, particularly those that are longer and less common,
do not have inflected comparative and superlative forms. Instead, they can be
qualified with more and most, as in beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful
(this construction is also sometimes used even for adjectives for which
inflected forms do exist).
Certain adjectives are classed as ungradable.[22] These represent properties
that cannot be compared on a scale; they simply apply or do not, as with
pregnant, dead, unique. Consequently, comparative and superlative forms of such
adjectives are not normally used, except in a figurative, humorous or imprecise
context. Similarly, such adjectives are not normally qualified with modifiers
of degree such as very and fairly, although with some of them it is idiomatic
to use adverbs such as completely. Another type of adjectives sometimes
considered ungradable is those that represent an extreme degree of some
property, such as delicious and terrified.
*** Phrases[edit] ***
An adjective_phrase is a group of words that plays the role of an adjective in
a sentence. It usually has a single adjective as its head, to which modifiers
and complements may be added.[23]
Adjectives can be modified by a preceding adverb or adverb phrase, as in very
warm, truly imposing, more than a little excited. Some can also be preceded by
a noun or quantitative phrase, as in fat-free, two-metre-long.
Complements following the adjective may include:
    * prepositional_phrases: proud of him, angry at the screen, keen on
      breeding toads;
    * infinitive phrases: anxious to solve the problem, easy to pick up;
    * content_clauses, i.e. that clauses and certain others: certain that he
      was right, unsure where they are;
    * after comparatives, phrases or clauses with than: better than you,
      smaller than I had imagined.
An adjective phrase may include both modifiers before the adjective and a
complement after it, as in very difficult to put away.
Adjective phrases containing complements after the adjective cannot normally be
used as attributive adjectives before a noun. Sometimes they are used
attributively_after_the_noun, as in a woman proud of being a midwife (where
they may be converted into relative clauses: a woman who is proud of being a
midwife), but it is wrong to say *a proud of being a midwife woman. Exceptions
include very brief and often established phrases such as easy-to-use. (Certain
complements can be moved to after the noun, leaving the adjective before the
noun, as in a better man than you, a hard nut to crack.)
Certain attributive adjective phrases are formed from other parts of speech,
without any adjective as their head, as in a two-bedroom house, a no-jeans
policy.
**** Adverbs[edit] ****
Adverbs perform a wide range of functions. They typically modify verbs (or verb
phrases), adjectives (or adjectival phrases), or other adverbs (or adverbial
phrases).[24] However, adverbs also sometimes qualify noun phrases (only the
boss; quite a lovely place), pronouns and determiners (almost all),
prepositional phrases (halfway through the movie), or whole sentences, to
provide contextual comment or indicate an attitude (Frankly, I don't believe
you).[25] They can also indicate a relationship between clauses or sentences
(He died, and consequently I inherited the estate).[25]
Many English adverbs are formed from adjectives by adding the ending -ly, as in
hopefully, widely, theoretically (for details of spelling and etymology, see -
ly). Certain words can be used as both adjectives and adverbs, such as fast,
straight, and hard; these are flat_adverbs. In earlier usage more flat adverbs
were accepted in formal usage; many of these survive in idioms and
colloquially. (That's just plain ugly.) Some adjectives can also be used as
flat adverbs when they actually describe the subject. (The streaker ran naked,
not **The streaker ran nakedly.) The adverb corresponding to the adjective good
is well (note that bad forms the regular badly, although ill is occasionally
used in some phrases).
There are also many adverbs that are not derived from adjectives,[24] including
adverbs of time, of frequency, of place, of degree and with other meanings.
Some suffixes that are commonly used to form adverbs from nouns are -ward[s]
(as in homeward[s]) and -wise (as in lengthwise).
Most adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by modification with more and
most: often, more often, most often; smoothly, more smoothly, most smoothly
(see also comparison_of_adjectives, above). However, a few adverbs retain
irregular inflection for comparative and superlative forms:[24] much, more,
most; a little, less, least; well, better, best; badly, worse, worst; far,
further (farther), furthest (farthest); or follow the regular adjectival
inflection: fast, faster, fastest; soon, sooner, soonest; etc.
Adverbs indicating the manner of an action are generally placed after the verb
and its objects (We considered the proposal carefully), although other
positions are often possible (We carefully considered the proposal). Many
adverbs of frequency, degree, certainty, etc. (such as often, always, almost,
probably, and various others such as just) tend to be placed before the verb
(they usually have chips), although if there is an auxiliary or other "special
verb" (see Â§ Verbs above), then the normal position for such adverbs is after
that special verb (or after the first of them, if there is more than one): I
have just finished the crossword; She can usually manage a pint; We are never
late; You might possibly have been unconscious. Adverbs that provide a
connection with previous information (such as next, then, however), and those
that provide the context (such as time or place) for a sentence, are typically
placed at the start of the sentence: Yesterday we went on a shopping
expedition.[26]
A special type of adverb is the adverbial particle used to form phrasal_verbs
(such as up in pick up, on in get on, etc.) If such a verb also has an object,
then the particle may precede or follow the object, although it will normally
follow the object if the object is a pronoun (pick the pen up or pick up the
pen, but pick it up).
*** Phrases[edit] ***
An adverb_phrase is a phrase that acts as an adverb within a sentence.[27] An
adverb phrase may have an adverb as its head, together with any modifiers
(other adverbs or adverb phrases) and complements, analogously to the adjective
phrases described above. For example: very sleepily; all too suddenly; oddly
enough; perhaps shockingly for us.
Another very common type of adverb phrase is the prepositional_phrase, which
consists of a preposition and its object: in the pool; after two years; for the
sake of harmony.
**** Prepositions[edit] ****
Prepositions form a closed word class,[25] although there are also certain
phrases that serve as prepositions, such as in front of. A single preposition
may have a variety of meanings, often including temporal, spatial and abstract.
Many words that are prepositions can also serve as adverbs. Examples of common
English prepositions (including phrasal instances) are of, in, on, over, under,
to, from, with, in front of, behind, opposite, by, before, after, during,
through, in spite of or despite, between, among, etc.
A preposition is usually used with a noun phrase as its complement. A
preposition together with its complement is called a prepositional_phrase.[28]
Examples are in England, under the table, after six pleasant weeks, between the
land and the sea. A prepositional phrase can be used as a complement or post-
modifier of a noun in a noun phrase, as in the man in the car, the start of the
fight; as a complement of a verb or adjective, as in deal with the problem,
proud of oneself; or generally as an adverb phrase (see above).
English allows the use of "stranded"_prepositions. This can occur in
interrogative and relative_clauses, where the interrogative or relative pronoun
that is the preposition's complement is moved to the start (fronted), leaving
the preposition in place. This kind of structure is avoided in some kinds of
formal English. For example:
    * What are you talking about? (Possible alternative version: About what are
      you talking?)
    * The song that you were listening to ... (more formal: The song to which
      you were listening ...)
Notice that in the second example the relative pronoun that could be omitted.
Stranded prepositions can also arise in passive_voice constructions and other
uses of passive past_participial_phrases, where the complement in a
prepositional phrase can become zero in the same way that a verb's direct
object would: it was looked at; I will be operated on; get your teeth seen to.
The same can happen in certain uses of infinitive phrases: he is nice to talk
to; this is the page to make copies of.
**** Conjunctions[edit] ****
Conjunctions express a variety of logical relations between items, phrases,
clauses and sentences.[29] The principal coordinating_conjunctions in English
are and, or, and but, as well as nor, so, yet, and for. These can be used in
many grammatical contexts to link two or more items of equal grammatical
status,[29] for example:
    * Noun phrases combined into a longer noun phrase, such as John, Eric, and
      Jill, the red coat or the blue one. When and is used, the resulting noun
      phrase is plural. A determiner does not need to be repeated with the
      individual elements: the cat, the dog, and the mouse and the cat, dog,
      and mouse are both correct. The same applies to other modifiers. (The
      word but can be used here in the sense of "except": nobody but you.)
    * Adjective or adverb phrases combined into a longer adjective or adverb
      phrase: tired but happy, over the fields and far away.
    * Verbs or verb phrases combined as in he washed, peeled, and diced the
      turnips (verbs conjoined, object shared); he washed the turnips, peeled
      them, and diced them (full verb phrases, including objects, conjoined).
    * Other equivalent items linked, such as prefixes linked in pre- and post-
      test counselling,[30] numerals as in two or three buildings, etc.
    * Clauses or sentences linked, as in We came, but they wouldn't let us in.
      They wouldn't let us in, nor would they explain what we had done wrong.
There are also correlative_conjunctions, where as well as the basic
conjunction, an additional element appears before the first of the items being
linked.[29] The common correlatives in English are:
    * either ... or (either a man or a woman);
    * neither ... nor (neither clever nor funny);
    * both ... and (they both punished and rewarded them);
    * not ... but, particularly in not only ... but also (not exhausted but
      exhilarated, not only football but also many other sports).
Subordinating_conjunctions make relations between clauses, making the clause in
which they appear into a subordinate_clause.[31] Some common subordinating
conjunctions in English are:
    * conjunctions of time, including after, before, since, until, when, while;
    * conjunctions of cause and effect, including because, since, now that, as,
      in order that, so;
    * conjunctions of opposition or concession, such as although, though, even
      though, whereas, while;
    * conjunctions of condition: such as if, unless, only if, whether or not,
      even if, in case (that);
    * the conjunction that, which produces content_clauses, as well as words
      that produce interrogative content clauses: whether, where, when, how,
      etc.
A subordinating conjunction generally comes at the very start of its clause,
although many of them can be preceded by qualifying adverbs, as in probably
because ..., especially if .... The conjunction that can be omitted after
certain verbs, as in she told us (that) she was ready. (For the use of that in
relative clauses, see Â§ Relative_pronouns above.)
**** Case[edit] ****
Although English has largely lost its case system, personal_pronouns still have
three morphological cases that are simplified forms of the nominative,
objective and genitive_cases:[32]
    * The nominative_case (subjective_pronouns such as I, he, she, we, they,
      who, whoever), used for the subject of a finite_verb and sometimes for
      the complement of a copula.
    * The oblique_case (object_pronouns such as me, him, her, us, it, us, them,
      whom, whomever), used for the direct or indirect object of a verb, for
      the object of a preposition, for an absolute disjunct, and sometimes for
      the complement of a copula.
    * The genitive_case (possessive_pronouns such as my/mine, his, her(s), our
      (s), its, our(s), their, theirs, whose), used for a grammatical
      possessor. This is not always considered to be a case; see English
      possessive_Â§ Status_of_the_possessive_as_a_grammatical_case.
Most English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case
forms, the possessive_case, which has both a determiner form (such as my, our)
and a distinct independent form (such as mine, ours) (with two exceptions: the
third_person singular masculine and the third person singular neuter it, which
use the same form for both determiner and independent [his car, it is his]),
and a distinct reflexive or intensive form (such as myself, ourselves). The
interrogative personal pronoun who exhibits the greatest diversity of forms
within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique,
and genitive forms (who, whom, whose) and equivalently coordinating indefinite
forms (whoever, whomever, and whosever).
Forms such as I, he, and we are used for the subject ("I kicked the ball"),
whereas forms such as me, him and us are used for the object ("John kicked
me").[33]
**** Declension[edit] ****
Further information: Declension
Nouns have distinct singular and plural forms; that is, they decline to reflect
their grammatical_number; consider the difference between book and books. In
addition, a few English pronouns have distinct nominative (also called
subjective) and oblique (or objective) forms; that is, they decline to reflect
their relationship to a verb or preposition, or case. Consider the difference
between he (subjective) and him (objective), as in "He saw it" and "It saw
him"; similarly, consider who, which is subjective, and the objective whom.
Further, these pronouns and a few others have distinct possessive forms, such
as his and whose. By contrast, nouns have no distinct nominative and objective
forms, the two being merged into a single plain case. For example, chair does
not change form between "the chair is here" (subject) and "I saw the chair"
(direct object). Possession is shown by the clitic -'s attached to a possessive
noun_phrase, rather than by declension of the noun itself.[34]
***** Negation[edit] *****
As noted above under Â§ Verbs, a finite indicative verb (or its clause) is
negated by placing the word not after an auxiliary, modal or other "special"
verb such as do, can or be. For example, the clause I go is negated with the
appearance of the auxiliary do, as I do not go (see do-support). When the
affirmative already uses auxiliary verbs (I am going), no other auxiliary verbs
are added to negate the clause (I am not going). (Until the period of early
Modern English, negation was effected without additional auxiliary verbs: I go
not.)
Most combinations of auxiliary verbs etc. with not have contracted_forms:
don't, can't, isn't, etc. (Also the uncontracted negated form of can is written
as a single word cannot.) On inversion of subject and verb (such as in
questions; see below), the subject may be placed after a contracted negated
form: Should he not pay? or Shouldn't he pay?
Other elements, such as noun phrases, adjectives, adverbs, infinitive and
participial phrases, etc., can be negated by placing the word not before them:
not the right answer, not interesting, not to enter, not noticing the train,
etc.
When other negating words such as never, nobody, etc. appear in a sentence, the
negating not is omitted (unlike its equivalents in many languages): I saw
nothing or I didn't see anything, but not (except in non-standard speech) *I
didn't see nothing (see Double_negative). Such negating words generally have
corresponding negative_polarity_items (ever for never, anybody for nobody,
etc.) which can appear in a negative context, but are not negative themselves
(and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double
negatives).
***** Clause and sentence structure[edit] *****
Main article: English_clause_syntax
A typical sentence contains one independent_clause and possibly one or more
dependent_clauses, although it is also possible to link together sentences of
this form into longer sentences, using coordinating conjunctions (see above). A
clause typically contains a subject (a noun phrase) and a predicate (a verb
phrase in the terminology used above; that is, a verb together with its objects
and complements). A dependent clause also normally contains a subordinating
conjunction (or in the case of relative clauses, a relative pronoun or phrase
containing one).
**** Word order[edit] ****
English word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second_(V2)_word_order to
being almost exclusively subjectâverbâobject (SVO). The combination of SVO
order and use of auxiliary_verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at
the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it. In most
sentences English marks grammatical relations only through word order. The
subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it.
The Objectâsubjectâverb (OSV) may on occasion be seen in English, usually
in the future_tense or used as a contrast with the conjunction "but", such as
in the following examples: "Rome I shall see!", "I hate oranges, but apples
I'll eat!".[35]
**** Questions[edit] ****
Like many other Western European languages, English historically allowed
questions to be formed by inverting the positions of verb and subject. Modern
English permits this only in the case of a small class of verbs ("special
verbs"), consisting of auxiliaries as well as forms of the copula be (see
subjectâauxiliary_inversion). To form a question from a sentence which does
not have such an auxiliary or copula present, the auxiliary verb do (does, did)
needs to be inserted, along with inversion of the word order, to form a
question (see do-support). For example:
    * She can dance. â Can she dance? (inversion of subject she and auxiliary
      can)
    * I am sitting here. â Am I sitting here? (inversion of subject I and
      copula am)
    * The milk goes in the fridge. â Does the milk go in the fridge? (no
      special verb present; do-support required)
The above concerns yes-no_questions, but inversion also takes place in the same
way after other questions, formed with interrogative_words such as where, what,
how, etc. An exception applies when the interrogative word is the subject or
part of the subject, in which case there is no inversion. For example:
    * I go. â Where do I go? (wh-question formed using inversion, with do-
      support required in this case)
    * He goes. â Who goes? (no inversion, because the question word who is
      the subject)
Note that inversion does not apply in indirect_questions: I wonder where he is
(not *... where is he). Indirect yes-no questions can be expressed using if or
whether as the interrogative word: Ask them whether/if they saw him.
Negative questions are formed similarly; however if the verb undergoing
inversion has a contraction with not, then it is possible to invert the subject
with this contraction as a whole. For example:
    * John is going. (affirmative)
    * John is not going. / John isn't going. (negative, with and without
      contraction)
    * Isn't John going? / Is John not going? (negative question, with and
      without contraction respectively)
See also English_auxiliaries_and_contractions_Â§ Contractions_and_inversion.
**** Dependent clauses[edit] ****
The syntax of a dependent clause is generally the same as that of an
independent clause, except that the dependent clause usually begins with a
subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun (or phrase containing such). In
some situations (as already described) the conjunction or relative pronoun that
can be omitted. Another type of dependent clause with no subordinating
conjunction is the conditional clause formed by inversion (see below).
**** Other uses of inversion[edit] ****
The clause structure with inverted subject and verb, used to form questions as
described above, is also used in certain types of declarative sentence. This
occurs mainly when the sentence begins with an adverbial or other phrase that
is essentially negative or contains words such as only, hardly, etc.: Never
have I known someone so stupid; Only in France can such food be tasted.
In elliptical sentences (see below), inversion takes place after so (meaning
"also") as well as after the negative neither: so do I, neither does she.
Inversion can also be used to form conditional clauses, beginning with should,
were (subjunctive), or had, in the following ways:
    * should I win the race (equivalent to if I win the race);
    * were he a soldier (equivalent to if he were a soldier);
    * were he to win the race (equivalent to if he were to win the race, i.e.
      if he won the race);
    * had he won the race (equivalent to if he had won the race).
Other similar forms sometimes appear, but are less common. There is also a
construction with subjunctive be, as in be he alive or dead (meaning "no matter
whether he is alive or dead").
Use of inversion to express a third-person imperative is now mostly confined to
the expression long live X, meaning "let X live long".
**** Imperatives[edit] ****
In an imperative sentence (one giving an order), there is usually no subject in
the independent clause: Go away until I call you. It is possible, however, to
include you as the subject for emphasis: You stay away from me.
**** Elliptical constructions[edit] ****
Many types of elliptical construction are possible in English, resulting in
sentences that omit certain redundant elements. Various examples are given in
the article on Ellipsis.
Some notable elliptical forms found in English include:
    * Short statements of the form I can, he isn't, we mustn't. Here the verb
      phrase (understood from the context) is reduced to a single auxiliary or
      other "special" verb, negated if appropriate. If there is no special verb
      in the original verb phrase, it is replaced by do/does/did: he does, they
      didn't.
    * Clauses that omit the verb, in particular those like me too, nor me, me
      neither. The latter forms are used after negative statements.
      (Equivalents including the verb: I do too or so do I; I don't either or
      neither do I.)
    * Tag_questions, formed with a special verb and pronoun subject: isn't it?;
      were there?; am I not?
***** History of English grammars[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_English_grammars
The first published English grammar was a Pamphlet for Grammar of 1586, written
by William_Bullokar with the stated goal of demonstrating that English was just
as rule-based as Latin. Bullokar's grammar was faithfully modeled on William
Lily's Latin grammar, Rudimenta Grammatices (1534), used in English schools at
that time, having been "prescribed" for them in 1542 by Henry_VIII. Bullokar
wrote his grammar in English and used a "reformed spelling system" of his own
invention; but many English grammars, for much of the century after Bullokar's
effort, were written in Latin, especially by authors who were aiming to be
scholarly. John_Wallis's Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae (1685) was the last
English grammar written in Latin.
Even as late as the early 19th century, Lindley_Murray, the author of one of
the most widely used grammars of the day, was having to cite "grammatical
authorities" to bolster the claim that grammatical cases in English are
different from those in Ancient Greek or Latin.
English parts_of_speech are based on Latin and Greek parts of speech.[36] Some
English grammar rules were adopted from Latin, for example John_Dryden is
thought to have created the rule no_sentences_can_end_in_a_preposition because
Latin cannot end sentences in prepositions. The rule of no split_infinitives
was adopted from Latin because Latin has no split infinitives.[37][38][39]
