Abundance at scales including the Universe, the Earth and the human body
The abundance of the chemical elements is a measure of the occurrence of the
chemical_elements relative to all other elements in a given environment.
Abundance is measured in one of three ways: by the mass-fraction (the same as
weight fraction); by the mole-fraction (fraction of atoms by numerical count,
or sometimes fraction of molecules in gases); or by the volume-fraction.
Volume-fraction is a common abundance measure in mixed gases such as planetary
atmospheres, and is similar in value to molecular mole-fraction for gas
mixtures at relatively low densities and pressures, and ideal_gas mixtures.
Most abundance values in this article are given as mass-fractions.
For example, the abundance of oxygen in pure water can be measured in two ways:
the mass fraction is about 89%, because that is the fraction of water's mass
which is oxygen. However, the mole-fraction is 33.3333...% because only 1 atom
of 3 in water, H2O, is oxygen. As another example, looking at the mass-fraction
abundance of hydrogen and helium in both the Universe as a whole and in the
atmospheres of gas-giant_planets such as Jupiter, it is 74% for hydrogen and
23â25% for helium; while the (atomic) mole-fraction for hydrogen is 92%, and
for helium is 8%, in these environments. Changing the given environment to
Jupiter's_outer_atmosphere, where hydrogen is diatomic while helium is not,
changes the molecular mole-fraction (fraction of total gas molecules), as well
as the fraction of atmosphere by volume, of hydrogen to about 86%, and of
helium to 13%.[Note_1]
The abundance of chemical elements in the universe is dominated by the large
amounts of hydrogen and helium which were produced in the Big_Bang. Remaining
elements, making up only about 2% of the universe, were largely produced by
supernovae and certain red_giant_stars. Lithium, beryllium and boron are rare
because although they are produced by nuclear fusion, they are then destroyed
by other reactions in the stars.[1][2] The elements from carbon to iron are
relatively more abundant in the universe because of the ease of making them in
supernova_nucleosynthesis. Elements of higher atomic number than iron (element
26) become progressively rarer in the universe, because they increasingly
absorb stellar energy in their production. Also, elements with even_atomic
numbers are generally more common than their neighbors in the periodic_table,
due to favorable energetics of formation.
The abundance of elements in the Sun and outer planets is similar to that in
the universe. Due to solar heating, the elements of Earth and the inner rocky
planets of the Solar System have undergone an additional depletion of volatile
hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, and carbon (which volatilizes as methane).
The crust, mantle, and core of the Earth show evidence of chemical segregation
plus some sequestration by density. Lighter silicates of aluminum are found in
the crust, with more magnesium silicate in the mantle, while metallic iron and
nickel compose the core. The abundance of elements in specialized environments,
such as atmospheres, or oceans, or the human body, are primarily a product of
chemical interactions with the medium in which they reside.

The elements â that is, ordinary (baryonic) matter made of protons, neutrons,
and electrons, are only a small part of the content of the Universe.
Cosmological_observations suggest that only 4.6% of the universe's energy
(including the mass contributed by energy, E = mcÂ² â m = E / cÂ²) comprises
the visible baryonic matter that constitutes stars, planets, and living beings.
The rest is thought to be made up of dark_energy (68%) and dark_matter (27%).
[4] These are forms of matter and energy believed to exist on the basis of
scientific_theory and inductive_reasoning based on observations, but they have
not been directly observed and their nature is not well understood.
Most standard (baryonic) matter is found in intergalactic gas, stars, and
interstellar_clouds, in the form of atoms or ions (plasma), although it can be
found in degenerate forms in extreme astrophysical settings, such as the high
densities inside white_dwarfs and neutron_stars.
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe; helium is second.
However, after this, the rank of abundance does not continue to correspond to
the atomic_number; oxygen has abundance rank 3, but atomic number 8. All others
are substantially less common.
The abundance of the lightest elements is well predicted by the standard
cosmological_model, since they were mostly produced shortly (i.e., within a few
hundred seconds) after the Big_Bang, in a process known as Big_Bang
nucleosynthesis. Heavier elements were mostly produced much later, inside of
stars.
Hydrogen and helium are estimated to make up roughly 74% and 24% of all
baryonic matter in the universe respectively. Despite comprising only a very
small fraction of the universe, the remaining "heavy elements" can greatly
influence astronomical phenomena. Only about 2% (by mass) of the Milky_Way
galaxy's disk is composed of heavy elements.
These other elements are generated by stellar processes.[5][6][7] In astronomy,
a "metal" is any element other than hydrogen or helium. This distinction is
significant because hydrogen and helium are the only elements that were
produced in significant quantities in the Big Bang. Thus, the metallicity of a
galaxy or other object is an indication of stellar activity, after the Big
Bang.
In general, elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of
becoming supernovae. Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most
stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of
decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei).
Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large
stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases
with increasing atomic number.

The following graph (note log scale) shows abundance of elements in the Solar
System. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy
(estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.[3]
Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding
enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant
galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of
elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. Since physical laws and
processes are uniform throughout the universe, however, it is expected that
these galaxies will likewise have evolved similar abundances of elements.
The abundance of elements is in keeping with their origin from the Big_Bang and
nucleosynthesis in a number of progenitor supernova stars. Very abundant
hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, while the next three elements
are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in
stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by breakup of heavier
elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by cosmic_rays).
Beginning with carbon, elements have been produced in stars by buildup from
alpha_particles (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance
of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). The effect
of odd-numbered chemical elements generally being more rare in the universe was
empirically noticed in 1914, and is known as the Oddo-Harkins_rule.

**** Relation to nuclear binding energy[edit] ****
Loose correlations have been observed between estimated elemental abundances in
the universe and the nuclear_binding_energy_curve. Roughly speaking, the
relative stability of various atomic nuclides has exerted a strong influence on
the relative abundance of elements formed in the Big_Bang, and during the
development of the universe thereafter.[9] See the article about
nucleosynthesis for the explanation on how certain nuclear_fusion processes in
stars (such as carbon_burning, etc.) create the elements heavier than hydrogen
and helium.
A further observed peculiarity is the jagged alternation between relative
abundance and scarcity of adjacent atomic numbers in the elemental abundance
curve, and a similar pattern of energy levels in the nuclear binding energy
curve. This alternation is caused by the higher relative binding_energy
(corresponding to relative stability) of even atomic numbers compared with odd
atomic numbers and is explained by the Pauli_Exclusion_Principle.[10] The semi-
empirical_mass_formula (SEMF), also called WeizsÃ¤cker's formula or the Bethe-
WeizsÃ¤cker mass formula, gives a theoretical explanation of the overall shape
of the curve of nuclear binding energy.[11]
***** Earth[edit] *****
See also: Earth_Â§ Chemical_composition
The Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the
planets acquired different compositions during the formation_and_evolution_of
the_solar_system. In turn, the natural_history_of_the_Earth caused parts of
this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements.
The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98Ã1024 kg. In bulk, by mass, it is
composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium
(13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%);
with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.[12]
The bulk composition of the Earth by elemental-mass is roughly similar to the
gross composition of the solar system, with the major differences being that
Earth is missing a great deal of the volatile elements hydrogen, helium, neon,
and nitrogen, as well as carbon which has been lost as volatile hydrocarbons.
The remaining elemental composition is roughly typical of the "rocky" inner
planets, which formed in the thermal zone where solar heat drove volatile
compounds into space. The Earth retains oxygen as the second-largest component
of its mass (and largest atomic-fraction), mainly from this element being
retained in silicate_minerals which have a very high melting point and low
vapor pressure.

**** Crust[edit] ****
Main article: Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth's_crust
Abundance (atom fraction) of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental
crust as a function of atomic number. The rarest elements in the crust (shown
in yellow) are rare due to a combination of factors: all but one are the
densest siderophiles (iron-loving) elements in the Goldschmidt_classification,
meaning they have a tendency to mix well with metallic iron, depleting them by
being relocated deeper into the Earth's core. Their abundance in meteoroids is
higher. Additionally, tellurium has been depleted by preaccretional sorting in
the nebula via formation of volatile hydrogen_telluride.[14]
The mass-abundance of the nine most abundant elements in the Earth's crust is
approximately: oxygen 46%, silicon 28%, aluminum 8.2%, iron 5.6%, calcium 4.2%,
sodium 2.5%, magnesium 2.4%, potassium 2.0%, and titanium 0.61%. Other elements
occur at less than 0.15%. For a complete list, see abundance_of_elements_in
Earth's_crust.
The graph at right illustrates the relative atomic-abundance of the chemical
elements in Earth's upper continental crustâ the part that is relatively
accessible for measurements and estimation.
Many of the elements shown in the graph are classified into (partially
overlapping) categories:
   1. rock-forming elements (major elements in green field, and minor elements
      in light green field);
   2. rare_earth_elements (lanthanides, La-Lu, and Y; labeled in blue);
   3. major industrial metals (global production >~3Ã107 kg/year; labeled in
      red);
   4. precious_metals (labeled in purple);
   5. the nine rarest "metals" â the six platinum_group elements plus Au, Re,
      and Te (a metalloid) â in the yellow field. These are rare in the crust
      from being soluble in iron and thus concentrated in the Earth's core.
      Tellurium is the single most depleted element in the silicate Earth
      relative to cosmic abundance, because in addition to being concentrated
      as dense chalcogenides in the core it was severely depleted by
      preaccretional sorting in the nebula as volatile hydrogen_telluride.[14]
Note that there are two breaks where the unstable (radioactive) elements
technetium (atomic number 43) and promethium (atomic number 61) would be. These
elements are surrounded by stable elements, yet both have relatively short half
lives (~ 4 million years and ~ 18 years respectively). These are thus extremely
rare, since any primordial initial fractions of these in pre-Solar System
materials have long since decayed. These two elements are now only produced
naturally through the spontaneous_fission of very heavy radioactive elements
(for example, uranium, thorium, or the trace amounts of plutonium that exist in
uranium ores), or by the interaction of certain other elements with cosmic
rays. Both technetium and promethium have been identified spectroscopically in
the atmospheres of stars, where they are produced by ongoing nucleosynthetic
processes.
There are also breaks in the abundance graph where the six noble_gases would
be, since they are not chemically bound in the Earth's crust, and they are only
generated by decay chains from radioactive elements in the crust, and are
therefore extremely rare there.
The eight naturally occurring very rare, highly radioactive elements (polonium,
astatine, francium, radium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and plutonium)
are not included, since any of these elements that were present at the
formation of the Earth have decayed away eons ago, and their quantity today is
negligible and is only produced from the radioactive_decay of uranium and
thorium.
Oxygen and silicon are notably the most common elements in the crust. On Earth
and in rocky planets in general, silicon and oxygen are far more common than
their cosmic abundance. The reason is that they combine with each other to form
silicate_minerals. In this way, they are the lightest of all of the two-percent
"astronomical metals" (i.e., non-hydrogen and helium elements) to form a solid
that is refractory to the Sun's heat, and thus cannot boil away into space. All
elements lighter than oxygen have been removed from the crust in this way, as
have the heavier chalcogens sulfur, selenium and tellurium.[14]
*** Rare-earth elements[edit] ***
"Rare" earth elements is a historical misnomer. The persistence of the term
reflects unfamiliarity rather than true rarity. The more abundant rare_earth
elements are similarly concentrated in the crust compared to commonplace
industrial metals such as chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin,
tungsten, or lead. The two least abundant rare earth elements (thulium and
lutetium) are nearly 200 times more common than gold. However, in contrast to
the ordinary base and precious metals, rare earth elements have very little
tendency to become concentrated in exploitable ore deposits. Consequently, most
of the world's supply of rare earth elements comes from only a handful of
sources. Furthermore, the rare earth metals are all quite chemically similar to
each other, and they are thus quite difficult to separate into quantities of
the pure elements.
Differences in abundances of individual rare earth elements in the upper
continental crust of the Earth represent the superposition of two effects, one
nuclear and one geochemical. First, the rare earth elements with even atomic
numbers (58Ce, 60Nd, ...) have greater cosmic and terrestrial abundances than
the adjacent rare earth elements with odd atomic numbers (57La, 59Pr, ...).
Second, the lighter rare earth elements are more incompatible (because they
have larger ionic radii) and therefore more strongly concentrated in the
continental crust than the heavier rare earth elements. In most rare earth ore
deposits, the first four rare earth elements â lanthanum, cerium,
praseodymium, and neodymium â constitute 80% to 99% of the total amount of
rare earth metal that can be found in the ore.
**** Mantle[edit] ****
Main article: Mantle_(geology)
The mass-abundance of the eight most abundant elements in the Earth's mantle
(see main article above) is approximately: oxygen 45%, magnesium 23%, silicon
22%, iron 5.8%, calcium 2.3%, aluminum 2.2%, sodium 0.3%, potassium 0.3%.
The mantle differs in elemental composition from the crust in having a great
deal more magnesium and significantly more iron, while having much less
aluminum and sodium.
**** Core[edit] ****
Due to mass_segregation, the core of the Earth is believed to be primarily
composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%),
and less than 1% trace elements.[12]
**** Ocean[edit] ****
For a complete list, see Abundances_of_the_elements_(data_page)_Â§ Sea_water.
The most abundant elements in the ocean by proportion of mass in percent are
oxygen (85.84), hydrogen (10.82), chlorine (1.94), sodium (1.08), magnesium
(0.1292), sulfur (0.091), calcium (0.04), potassium (0.04), bromine (0.0067),
carbon (0.0028), and boron (0.00043).
**** Atmosphere[edit] ****
The order of elements by volume-fraction (which is approximately molecular
mole-fraction) in the atmosphere is nitrogen (78.1%), oxygen (20.9%),[15] argon
(0.96%), followed by (in uncertain order) carbon and hydrogen because water
vapor and carbon dioxide, which represent most of these two elements in the
air, are variable components. Sulfur, phosphorus, and all other elements are
present in significantly lower proportions.
According to the abundance curve graph (above right), argon, a significant if
not major component of the atmosphere, does not appear in the crust at all.
This is because the atmosphere has a far smaller mass than the crust, so argon
remaining in the crust contributes little to mass-fraction there, while at the
same time buildup of argon in the atmosphere has become large enough to be
significant.
**** Urban soils[edit] ****

of_the_elements_(data_page)#Urban_soils.
***** Human body[edit] *****

By mass, human cells consist of 65â90% water (H2O), and a significant portion
of the remainder is composed of carbon-containing organic molecules. Oxygen
therefore contributes a majority of a human body's mass, followed by carbon.
Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: hydrogen
(H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P).
The next 0.75% is made up of the next five elements: potassium (K), sulfur (S),
chlorine (Cl), sodium (Na), and magnesium (Mg). CHNOPS for short. Only 17
elements are known for certain to be necessary to human life, with one
additional element (fluorine) thought to be helpful for tooth enamel strength.
A few more trace_elements may play some role in the health of mammals. Boron
and silicon are notably necessary for plants but have uncertain roles in
animals. The elements aluminium and silicon, although very common in the
earth's crust, are conspicuously rare in the human body.[16]

(In the case of lanthanum, the definition of an essential nutrient as being
indispensable and irreplaceable is not completely applicable due to the extreme
similarity of the lanthanides. The early lanthanides up to Sm are known to
stimulate the growth of various lanthanide-using organisms.)[18]
