In astronomy, extinction is the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic
radiation by dust and gas between an emitting astronomical_object and the
observer. Interstellar extinction was first documented as such in 1930 by
Robert_Julius_Trumpler.[1][2] However, its effects had been noted in 1847 by
Friedrich_Georg_Wilhelm_von_Struve,[3] and its effect on the colors of stars
had been observed by a number of individuals who did not connect it with the
general presence of galactic dust. For stars that lie near the plane of the
Milky_Way and are within a few thousand parsecs of the Earth, extinction in the
visual band of frequencies (photometric_system) is on_the_order of
1.8 magnitudes per kiloparsec.[4]
For Earth-bound observers, extinction arises both from the interstellar_medium
(ISM) and the Earth's_atmosphere; it may also arise from circumstellar_dust
around an observed object. Strong extinction in earth's atmosphere of some
wavelength regions (such as X-ray, ultraviolet, and infrared) is overcome by
the use of space-based observatories. Since blue light is much more strongly
attenuated than red light, extinction causes objects to appear redder than
expected, a phenomenon referred to as interstellar reddening.[5]

***** Interstellar reddening[edit] *****
In astronomy, interstellar reddening is a phenomenon associated with
interstellar extinction where the spectrum of electromagnetic_radiation from a
radiation_source changes characteristics from that which the object originally
emitted. Reddening occurs due to the light scattering off dust and other matter
in the interstellar_medium. Interstellar reddening is a different phenomenon
from redshift, which is the proportional frequency_shifts of spectra without
distortion. Reddening preferentially removes shorter wavelength photons from a
radiated spectrum while leaving behind the longer wavelength photons (in the
optical, light that is redder), leaving the spectroscopic_lines unchanged.
In most photometric_systems filters (passbands) are used from which readings of
magnitude of light may take account of latitude and humidity among terrestrial
factors. Interstellar reddening equates to the "color excess", defined as the
difference between an object's observed color index and its intrinsic color
index (sometimes referred to as its normal color index). The latter is the
theoretical value which it would have if unaffected by extinction. In the first
system, the UBV_photometric_system devised in the 1950s and its most closely
related successors, the object's color excess      E  B &#x2212; V
{\displaystyle E_{B-V}}  [E_{{B-V}}] is related to the object's BâV_color
(calibrated blue minus calibrated visible) by:
    E  B &#x2212; V   = ( B &#x2212; V  )   observed    &#x2212; ( B &#x2212; V
)   intrinsic       {\displaystyle E_{B-V}=(B-V)_{\textrm {observed}}-(B-V)_
{\textrm {intrinsic}}\,}  [E_{{B-V}}=(B-V)_{{{\textrm  {observed}}}}-(B-V)_{{
{\textrm  {intrinsic}}}}\,]
For an A0-type main sequence star (these have median wavelength and heat among
the main sequence) the color indices are calibrated at 0 based on an intrinsic
reading of such a star (Â± exactly 0.02 depending on which spectral point, i.e.
precise passband within the abbreviated color name is in question, see color
index). At least two and up to five measured passbands in magnitude are then
compared by subtraction: U,B,V,I or R during which the color excess from
extinction is calculated and deducted. The name of the four sub-indices (R
minus I etc.) and order of the subtraction of recalibrated magnitudes is from
right to immediate left within this sequence.
***** General characteristics[edit] *****
Interstellar reddening occurs because interstellar_dust absorbs and scatters
blue light waves more than red light waves, making stars appear redder than
they are. This is similar to the effect seen when dust particles in the
atmosphere of Earth contribute to red sunsets.[6]
Broadly speaking, interstellar extinction is strongest at short wavelengths,
generally observed by using techniques from spectroscopy. Extinction results in
a change in the shape of an observed spectrum. Superimposed on this general
shape are absorption features (wavelength bands where the intensity is lowered)
that have a variety of origins and can give clues as to the chemical
composition of the interstellar material, e.g. dust_grains. Known absorption
features include the 2175 Ã bump, the diffuse_interstellar_bands, the 3.1 Î¼m
water ice feature, and the 10 and 18 Î¼m silicate features.
In the solar neighborhood, the rate of interstellar extinction in the Johnson-
Cousins_V-band_(visual_filter) averaged at a wavelength of 540 nm is usually
taken to be 0.7â1.0 mag/kpcâsimply an average due to the clumpiness of
interstellar dust.[7][8][9] In general, however, this means that a star will
have its brightness reduced by about a factor of 2 in the V-band viewed from a
good night sky vantage point on earth for every kiloparsec (3,260 light years)
it is farther away from us.
The amount of extinction can be significantly higher than this in specific
directions. For example, some regions of the Galactic_Center are awash with
obvious intervening dark dust from our spiral arm (and perhaps others) and
themselves in a bulge of dense matter, causing as much as more than 30
magnitudes of extinction in the optical, meaning that less than 1 optical
photon in 1012 passes through.[10] This results in the so-called zone_of
avoidance, where our view of the extra-galactic sky is severely hampered, and
background galaxies, such as Dwingeloo_1, were only discovered recently through
observations in radio and infrared.
The general shape of the ultraviolet through near-infrared (0.125 to 3.5 Î¼m)
extinction curve (plotting extinction in magnitude against wavelength, often
inverted) looking from our vantage point at other objects in the Milky_Way, is
fairly well characterized by the stand-alone parameter of relative visibility
(of such visible light) R(V) (which is different along different lines of
sight),[11][12] but there are known deviations from this characterization.[13]
Extending the extinction law into the mid-infrared wavelength range is
difficult due to the lack of suitable targets and various contributions by
absorption features.[14]
R(V) compares aggregate and particular extinctions. It is A(V)/E(BâV).
Restated, it is the total extinction, A(V) divided by the selective total
extinction (A(B)âA(V)) of those two wavelengths (bands). A(B) and A(V) are
the total extinction at the B_and_V filter bands. Another measure used in the
literature is the absolute extinction A(Î»)/A(V) at wavelength Î», comparing
the total extinction at that wavelength to that at the V band.
R(V) is known to be correlated with the average size of the dust grains causing
the extinction. For our own galaxy, the Milky Way, the typical value for R(V)
is 3.1,[15] but is found to vary considerably across different lines of sight.
[16] As a result, when computing cosmic distances it can be advantageous to
move to star data from the near-infared (of which the filter or passband Ks is
quite standard) where the variations and amount of extinction are significantly
less, and similar ratios as to R(Ks):[17] 0.49Â±0.02 and 0.528Â±0.015 were
found respectively by independent groups.[16][18] Those two more modern
findings differ substantially relative to the commonly referenced historical
value â0.7.[11]
The relationship between the total extinction, A(V) (measured in magnitudes),
and the column_density of neutral hydrogen atoms column, NH (usually measured
in cmâ2), shows how the gas and dust in the interstellar medium are related.
From studies using ultraviolet spectroscopy of reddened stars and X-ray
scattering halos in the Milky Way, Predehl and Schmitt[19] found the
relationship between NH and A(V) to be approximately:
            N  H    A ( V )    &#x2248; 1.8 &#x00D7;  10  21   &#xA0;   atoms
      &#xA0;    cm    &#x2212; 2   &#xA0;    mag    &#x2212; 1
      {\displaystyle {\frac {N_{H}}{A(V)}}\approx 1.8\times 10^{21}~{\mbox
      {atoms}}~{\mbox{cm}}^{-2}~{\mbox{mag}}^{-1}}  [{\frac  {N_{H}}{A
      (V)}}\approx 1.8\times 10^{{21}}~{\mbox{atoms}}~{\mbox{cm}}^{{-2}}~{\mbox
      {mag}}^{{-1}}]
(see also:[20][21][22]).
Astronomers have determined the three-dimensional distribution of extinction in
the "solar circle" (our region of our_galaxy), using visible and near-infrared
stellar observations and a model of distribution of stars.[23][24] The dust
causing extinction mainly lies along the spiral_arms, as observed in other
spiral_galaxies.
***** Measuring extinction towards an object[edit] *****
To measure the extinction curve for a star, the star's spectrum is compared to
the observed spectrum of a similar star known not to be affected by extinction
(unreddened).[25] It is also possible to use a theoretical spectrum instead of
the observed spectrum for the comparison, but this is less common. In the case
of emission_nebulae, it is common to look at the ratio of two emission_lines
which should not be affected by the temperature and density in the nebula. For
example, the ratio of hydrogen_alpha to hydrogen_beta emission is always around
2.85 under a wide range of conditions prevailing in nebulae. A ratio other than
2.85 must therefore be due to extinction, and the amount of extinction can thus
be calculated.
***** The 2175-angstrom feature[edit] *****
One prominent feature in measured extinction curves of many objects within the
Milky Way is a broad 'bump' at about 2175 Ã, well into the ultraviolet region
of the electromagnetic_spectrum. This feature was first observed in the 1960s,
[26][27] but its origin is still not well understood. Several models have been
presented to account for this bump which include graphitic grains with a
mixture of PAH molecules. Investigations of interstellar grains embedded in
interplanetary dust particles (IDP) observed this feature and identified the
carrier with organic carbon and amorphous silicates present in the grains.[28]
***** Extinction curves of other galaxies[edit] *****
Plot showing the average extinction curves for the MW, LMC2, LMC, and SMC Bar.
[29] The curves are plotted versus 1/wavelength to emphasize the UV.
The form of the standard extinction curve depends on the composition of the
ISM, which varies from galaxy to galaxy. In the Local_Group, the best-
determined extinction curves are those of the Milky Way, the Small_Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) and the Large_Magellanic_Cloud (LMC).
In the LMC, there is significant variation in the characteristics of the
ultraviolet extinction with a weaker 2175 Ã bump and stronger far-UV
extinction in the region associated with the LMC2 supershell (near the 30
Doradus starbursting region) than seen elsewhere in the LMC and in the Milky
Way.[30][31] In the SMC, more extreme variation is seen with no 2175 Ã and
very strong far-UV extinction in the star forming Bar and fairly normal
ultraviolet extinction seen in the more quiescent Wing.[32][33][34]
This gives clues as to the composition of the ISM in the various galaxies.
Previously, the different average extinction curves in the Milky Way, LMC, and
SMC were thought to be the result of the different metallicities of the three
galaxies: the LMC's metallicity is about 40% of that of the Milky_Way, while
the SMC's is about 10%. Finding extinction curves in both the LMC and SMC which
are similar to those found in the Milky Way[29] and finding extinction curves
in the Milky Way that look more like those found in the LMC2 supershell of the
LMC[35] and in the SMC Bar[36] has given rise to a new interpretation. The
variations in the curves seen in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way may
instead be caused by processing of the dust grains by nearby star formation.
This interpretation is supported by work in starburst galaxies (which are
undergoing intense star formation episodes) that their dust lacks the 2175 Ã
bump.[37][38]
***** Atmospheric extinction[edit] *****
Atmospheric extinction gives the rising or setting Sun an orange hue and varies
with location and altitude. Astronomical observatories generally are able to
characterise the local extinction curve very accurately, to allow observations
to be corrected for the effect. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is completely
opaque to many wavelengths requiring the use of satellites to make
observations.
This extinction has three main components: Rayleigh_scattering by air
molecules, scattering by particulates, and molecular absorption. Molecular
absorption is often referred to as telluric_absorption, as it is caused by the
Earth (telluric is a synonym for terrestrial). The most important sources of
telluric absorption are molecular_oxygen and ozone, which strongly absorb
radiation near ultraviolet, and water, which strongly absorbs infrared.
The amount of such extinction is lowest at the observer's zenith and highest
near the horizon. A given star, preferably at solar opposition, reaches its
greatest celestial_altitude and optimal time for observation when the star is
near the local meridian around solar midnight and if the star has a favorable
declination (i.e. similar to the observer's latitude); thus, the seasonal time
due to axial_tilt is key. Extinction is approximated by multiplying the
standard atmospheric extinction curve (plotted against each wavelength) by the
mean air_mass calculated over the duration of the observation. A dry atmosphere
reduces infrared extinction significantly.
