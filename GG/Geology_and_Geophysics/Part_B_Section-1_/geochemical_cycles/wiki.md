****** Geochemical cycle ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In Earth_science, a geochemical cycle is the pathway that chemical_elements
take in the surface and crust_of_the_Earth.[1] The term "geochemical" tells us
that geological and chemical factors are all included. The migration of heated
and compressed chemical elements and compounds such as silicon, aluminium, and
general alkali_metals through the means of subduction and volcanism is known in
the geological world as geochemical cycles.
The geochemical cycle encompasses the natural separation and concentration of
elements and heat-assisted recombination processes. Changes may not be apparent
over a short term, such as with biogeochemical_cycles, but over a long term
changes of great magnitude occur, including the evolution of continents and
oceans.[1]

***** Differentiating biogeochemical cycles[edit] *****
Some may use the terms biogeochemical_cycle and geochemical cycle
interchangeably because both cycles deal with Earth's reservoirs. However, a
biogeochemical cycle refers to the chemical interactions in surface reservoirs
such as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere whereas a
geochemical cycle refers to the chemical interactions that exist in crustal and
sub crustal reservoirs such as the deep earth and lithosphere.
***** Earth system[edit] *****
The Earth, as a system, is open to radiation from the sun and space, but is
practically closed with regard to matter.[2] As all closed systems, it follows
the law of conservation_of_mass which states that matter cannot be created nor
destroyed, thus, the matter, although transformed and migrated, remains the
same as when the Earth was formed. The Earth system contains seven different
reservoirs that are separated into surface reservoirs, which include
atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, pedosphere, and lithosphere and the
isolated reservoirs that include deep Earth and outer_space.[2] Geochemical
cycles are concerned with the interactions between deep earth which consists of
Earth's mantle and core, and the lithosphere which consists of the Earth's
crust.
***** Pathways[edit] *****
Flux in geochemical cycles is the movement of material between the deep Earth
and the surface reservoirs. This occurs through two different processes:
volcanism and subduction of tectonic_plates.
Subduction is the process that takes place at convergent_boundaries by which
one tectonic_plate moves under another tectonic plate and sinks into the mantle
as the plates converge. This leads to the sinking of one plate into the mantle
which creates a broad range of geochemical transformations or cycling.
Volcanism is the process that takes place at divergent boundaries by which one
tectonic_plate separates from another creating a rift in which molten rock
(magma) erupts onto the surface of the Earth. This molten rock magma then cools
and crystallizes, forming igneous rocks. If crystallization occurs at the
Earth's surface, extrusive igneous_rocks are formed; if crystallization occurs
within the Earth's lithosphere, intrusive igneous rocks are formed which can
then be brought to Earth's surface by denudation.[3]
