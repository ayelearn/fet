The classification of minerals is a process of determining to which of several
groups minerals belong based on their chemical characteristics. Since the
1950s, this classification has been carried out by the International
Mineralogical_Association, which classifies minerals into the following broad
classes:
    * Classification_of_non-silicate_minerals
    * Classification_of_silicate_minerals
    * Classification_of_organic_minerals
