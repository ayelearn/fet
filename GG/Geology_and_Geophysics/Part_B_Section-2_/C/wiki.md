***** History *****
Phoenician  Arabic       Hebrew         Greek         EtruscanÂ    Old Latin
gaml        Ã‡Â§Ã„Â«m    gimel          Gamma         C            C (G)
[Phoenician [Arabic_Gim] [Hebrew_gimel] [Greek_Gamma] [Etruscan_C] [Old_Latin]
gimel]
"C" comes from the same letter as "G". The Semites named it gimel. The sign is
possibly adapted from an Egyptian_hieroglyph for a staff_sling, which may have
been the meaning of the name gimel. Another possibility is that it depicted a
camel, the Semitic name for which was gamal. Barry_B._Powell, a specialist in
the history of writing, states "It is hard to imagine how gimel = "camel" can
be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and
neck!)".[2]
In the Etruscan_language, plosive_consonants had no contrastive voicing, so the
Greek 'ÃÂ“' (Gamma) was adopted into the Etruscan_alphabet to represent /k/.
Already in the Western_Greek_alphabet, Gamma first took a '[Early_Etruscan
C.gif]' form in Early Etruscan, then '[Classical_Etruscan_C.gif]' in Classical
Etruscan. In Latin it eventually took the '
c' form in Classical Latin. In the earliest Latin inscriptions, the letters '
c k q' were used to represent the sounds /k/ and /Ã‰Â¡/ (which were not
differentiated in writing). Of these, '
q' was used to represent /k/ or /Ã‰Â¡/ before a rounded vowel, '
k' before '
a', and '
c' elsewhere.[3] During the 3rd century BC, a modified character was introduced
for /Ã‰Â¡/, and '
c' itself was retained for /k/. The use of '
c' (and its variant '
g') replaced most usages of '
k' and '
q'. Hence, in the classical period and after, '
g' was treated as the equivalent of Greek gamma, and '
c' as the equivalent of kappa; this shows in the romanization of Greek words,
as in 'ÃÂšÃÂ‘ÃÂ”ÃÂœÃÂŸÃÂ£', 'ÃÂšÃÂ¥ÃÂ¡ÃÂŸÃÂ£', and 'ÃÂ¦ÃÂ©ÃÂšÃÂ™ÃÂ£' came into Latin as '
cadmvs', '
cyrvs' and '
phocis', respectively.
Other alphabets have letters homoglyphic to 'c' but not analogous in use and
derivation, like the Cyrillic letter Es (ÃÂ¡, Ã‘Â) which derives from the lunate
sigma, named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon.

When the Roman alphabet was introduced into Britain, &#x27e8;c&#x27e9;
represented only /k/, and this value of the letter has been retained in
loanwords to all the insular_Celtic_languages: in Welsh, Irish, Gaelic,
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; represents only /k/. The Old_English_Latin-based_writing
system was learned from the Celts, apparently of Ireland; hence
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; in Old English also originally represented /k/; the Modern
English words kin, break, broken, thick, and seek, all come from Old English
words written with &#x27e8;c&#x27e9;: cyn, brecan, brocen, ÃƒÂ¾icc, and sÃƒÂ©oc.
But during the course of the Old English period, /k/ before front vowels (/e/
and /i/) were palatalized, having changed by the tenth century to [tÃŠÂƒ], though
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; was still used, as in cir(i)ce, wrecc(e)a. On the continent,
meanwhile, a similar phonetic change had also been going on (for example, in
Italian).
In Vulgar Latin, /k/ became palatalized to [tÃŠÂƒ] in Italy and Dalmatia; in
France and the Iberian peninsula, it became [ts]. Yet for these new sounds
&#x27e8;
c&#x27e9; was still used before the letters &#x27e8;e&#x27e9; and
&#x27e8;i&#x27e9;. The letter thus represented two distinct values.
Subsequently, the Latin phoneme /kÃŠÂ·/ (spelled &#x27e8;
qv&#x27e9;) de-labialized to /k/ meaning that the various Romance languages had
/k/ before front vowels. In addition, Norman used the letter &#x27e8;k&#x27e9;
so that the sound /k/ could be represented by either &#x27e8;k&#x27e9; or
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9;, the latter of which could represent either /k/ or /ts/
depending on whether it preceded a front vowel letter or not. The convention of
using both &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; and &#x27e8;k&#x27e9; was applied to the writing
of English after the Norman_Conquest, causing a considerable re-spelling of the
Old English words. Thus while Old English candel, clif, corn, crop, cÃƒÂº,
remained unchanged, Cent, cÃƒÂ¦Ã‚Â´Ã¡ÂµÂ¹ (cÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â´Ã¡ÂµÂ¹), cyng, brece, sÃƒÂ©oce, were now
(without any change of sound) spelled 'Kent', 'keÃˆÂ', 'kyng', 'breke', and
'seoke'; even cniht ('knight') was subsequently changed to 'kniht' and ÃƒÂ¾ic
('thick') changed to 'thik' or 'thikk'. The Old English 'cw' was also at length
displaced by the French 'qu' so that the Old English cwÃƒÂ©n ('queen') and cwic
('quick') became Middle_English 'quen' 'quik', respectively. The sound [tÃŠÂƒ],
to which Old English palatalized /k/ had advanced, also occurred in French,
chiefly from Latin /k/ before 'a'. In French it was represented by the digraph
&#x27e8;ch&#x27e9;, as in champ (from Latin camp-um) and this spelling was
introduced into English: the Hatton Gospels, written about 1160, have in Matt.
i-iii, child, chyld, riche, mychel, for the cild, rice, mycel, of the Old
English version whence they were copied. In these cases, the Old English
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; gave place to &#x27e8;k qu ch&#x27e9; but, on the other hand,
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; in its new value of /ts/ came in largely in French words like
processiun, emperice, grace, and was also substituted for 'ts' in a few Old
English words, as miltse, bletsien, in early Middle English milce, blecien. By
the end of the thirteenth century both in France and England, this sound /ts/
de-affricated to /s/; and from that time &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; has represented /s/
before front vowels either for etymological reasons, as in lance, cent, or to
avoid the ambiguity due to the "etymological" use of &#x27e8;s&#x27e9; for /z/,
as in ace, mice, once, pence, defence.
Thus, to show etymology, English spelling has advise, devise (instead of
advize, devize), while advice, device, dice, ice, mice, twice, etc., do not
reflect etymology; example has extended this to hence, pence, defence, etc.,
where there is no etymological reason for using &#x27e8;c&#x27e9;. Former
generations also wrote sence for sense. Hence, today the Romance_languages and
English have a common feature inherited from Vulgar_Latin spelling conventions
where &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; takes on either a "hard"_or_"soft" value depending on
the following letter.

**** English ****
In English_orthography, &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; generally represents the "soft" value
of /s/ before the letters &#x27e8;e&#x27e9; (including the Latin-derived
digraphs &#x27e8;ae&#x27e9; and &#x27e8;oe&#x27e9;, or the corresponding
ligatures &#x27e8;ÃƒÂ¦&#x27e9; and &#x27e8;Ã…Â“&#x27e9;), &#x27e8;i&#x27e9;, and
&#x27e8;y&#x27e9;, and a "hard" value of /k/ before any other letters or at the
end of a word. However, there are a number of exceptions in English: "soccer"
and "Celt" are words that have /k/ where /s/ would be expected.
The "soft" &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; may represent the /ÃŠÂƒ/ sound in the digraph
&#x27e8;ci&#x27e9; when this precedes a vowel, as in the words 'delicious' and
'appreciate', and also in the word "ocean" and its derivatives.
The digraph &#x27e8;ch&#x27e9; most commonly represents /tÃŠÂƒ/, but can also
represent /k/ (mainly in words of Greek origin) or /ÃŠÂƒ/ (mainly in words of
French origin). For some dialects of English, it may also represent /x/ in
words like loch, while other speakers pronounce the final sound as /k/. The
trigraph &#x27e8;tch&#x27e9; always represents /tÃŠÂƒ/.
The digraph &#x27e8;ck&#x27e9; is often used to represent the sound /k/ after
short vowels.
**** Other languages ****
In the Romance languages French, Spanish, Italian, Romanian and Portuguese,
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; generally has a "hard" value of /k/ and a "soft" value whose
pronunciation varies by language. In French, Portuguese, Catalan and Spanish
from Latin America and southern Spain, the soft &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; value is /s/
as it is in English. In the Spanish spoken in northern and central Spain, the
soft &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; is a voiceless_dental_fricative /ÃÂ¸/. In Italian and
Romanian, the soft &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; is [tÃÂ¡ÃŠÂƒ].
All Balto-Slavic_languages that use the Latin alphabet, as well as Albanian,
Hungarian, Pashto, several Sami_languages, Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, and
Americanist_phonetic_notation (and those aboriginal_languages_of_North_America
whose practical orthography derives from it) use &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; to represent
/tÃÂ¡s/, the voiceless_alveolar or voiceless_dental_sibilant_affricate. In Hanyu
Pinyin, the standard romanization of Mandarin_Chinese, the letter represents an
aspirated version of this sound, /tÃÂ¡sÃŠÂ°/.
Among non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet,
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; represents a variety of sounds. Yup'ik, Indonesian, Malay,
and a number of African languages such as Hausa, Fula, and Manding share the
soft Italian value of /tÃÂ¡ÃŠÂƒ/. In Azeri, Crimean_Tatar, Kurmanji_Kurdish, and
Turkish &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; stands for the voiced counterpart of this sound, the
voiced_postalveolar_affricate /dÃÂ¡ÃŠÂ’/. In Yabem and similar languages, such as
Bukawa, &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; stands for a glottal_stop /ÃŠÂ”/. Xhosa and Zulu use
this letter to represent the click /Ã‡Â€/. In some other African languages, such
as Berber_languages, &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; is used for /ÃŠÂƒ/. In Fijian,
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; stands for a voiced_dental_fricative /ÃƒÂ°/, while in Somali it
has the value of /ÃŠÂ•/.
The letter &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; is also used as a transliteration of Cyrillic
&#x27e8;Ã‘Â†&#x27e9; in the Latin forms of Serbian, Macedonian, and sometimes
Ukrainian, along with the digraph &#x27e8;ts&#x27e9;.
**** Other systems ****
As a phonetic symbol, lowercase &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; is the International_Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA) and X-SAMPA symbol for the voiceless_palatal_plosive, and
capital &#x27e8;C&#x27e9; is the X-SAMPA symbol for the voiceless_palatal
fricative.
**** Digraphs ****
There are several common digraphs with &#x27e8;c&#x27e9;, the most common being
&#x27e8;ch&#x27e9;, which in some languages (such as German) is far more common
than &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; alone. &#x27e8;ch&#x27e9; takes various values in other
languages.
As in English, &#x27e8;ck&#x27e9;, with the value /k/, is often used after
short vowels in other Germanic_languages such as German and Swedish (but some
other Germanic languages use &#x27e8;kk&#x27e9; instead, such as Dutch and
Norwegian). The digraph &#x27e8;cz&#x27e9; is found in Polish and
&#x27e8;cs&#x27e9; in Hungarian, both representing /tÃÂ¡ÃŠÂƒ/. The digraph
&#x27e8;sc&#x27e9; represents /ÃŠÂƒ/ in Old English, Italian, and a few languages
related to Italian (where this only happens before front_vowels, while
otherwise it represents /sk/). The trigraph &#x27e8;sch&#x27e9; represents /ÃŠÂƒ/
in German.
