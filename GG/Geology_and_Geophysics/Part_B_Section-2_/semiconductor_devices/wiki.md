A semiconductor device is an electronic_component that exploits the electronic
properties of semiconductor material, principally silicon, germanium, and
gallium_arsenide, as well as organic_semiconductors. Semiconductor devices have
replaced vacuum_tubes in most applications. They use electrical_conduction in
the solid_state rather than the gaseous_state or thermionic_emission in a
vacuum.
Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as
integrated_circuits (ICs), which consist of two or more devicesâwhich can
number in the billionsâmanufactured and interconnected on a single
semiconductor wafer (also called a substrate).
Semiconductor materials are useful because their behavior can be easily
manipulated by the deliberate addition of impurities, known as doping.
Semiconductor conductivity can be controlled by the introduction of an electric
or magnetic field, by exposure to light or heat, or by the mechanical
deformation of a doped monocrystalline_silicon grid; thus, semiconductors can
make excellent sensors. Current conduction in a semiconductor occurs due to
mobile or "free" electrons and electron_holes, collectively known as charge
carriers. Doping a semiconductor with a small proportion of an atomic impurity,
such as phosphorus or boron, greatly increases the number of free electrons or
holes within the semiconductor. When a doped semiconductor contains excess
holes, it is called a p-type_semiconductor (p for positive electric_charge);
when it contains excess free electrons, it is called an n-type_semiconductor (n
for negative electric charge). A majority of mobile charge carriers have
negative charge. The manufacture of semiconductors controls precisely the
location and concentration of p- and n-type dopants. The connection of n-type
and p-type semiconductors form pân_junctions.
The most common semiconductor device in the world is the MOSFET
(metalâoxideâsemiconductor field-effect_transistor),[1] also called the MOS
transistor. As of 2013, billions of MOS transistors are manufactured every day.
[2] Semiconductor devices made per year have been growing by 9.1% on average
since 1978, and shipments in 2018 are predicted for the first time to exceed 1
trillion,[3] meaning that well over 7 trillion has been made to date, in just
in the decade prior.

***** Diode[edit] *****
Main article: Diode
A semiconductor diode is a device typically made from a single pân junction.
At the junction of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor there forms a depletion
region where current conduction is inhibited by the lack of mobile charge
carriers. When the device is forward biased (connected with the p-side at
higher electric_potential than the n-side), this depletion region is
diminished, allowing for significant conduction, while only very small current
can be achieved when the diode is reverse biased and thus the depletion region
expanded.
Exposing a semiconductor to light can generate electronâhole_pairs, which
increases the number of free carriers and thereby the conductivity. Diodes
optimized to take advantage of this phenomenon are known as photodiodes.
Compound_semiconductor diodes can also be used to generate light, as in light-
emitting_diodes and laser_diodes.
***** Transistor[edit] *****
Main article: Transistor
An nâpân bipolar junction transistor structure
Operation of a MOSFET and its Id-Vg curve. At first, when no gate voltage is
applied. There is no inversion electron in the channel, the device is OFF. As
gate voltage increase, inversion electron density in the channel increase,
current increase, the device turns on.
**** Bipolar junction transistor[edit] ****
Bipolar_junction_transistors are formed from two pân junctions, in either
nâpân or pânâp configuration. The middle, or base, region between the
junctions is typically very narrow. The other regions, and their associated
terminals, are known as the emitter and the collector. A small current injected
through the junction between the base and the emitter changes the properties of
the base-collector junction so that it can conduct current even though it is
reverse biased. This creates a much larger current between the collector and
emitter, controlled by the base-emitter current.
**** Field-effect transistor[edit] ****
Another type of transistor, the field-effect_transistor, operates on the
principle that semiconductor conductivity can be increased or decreased by the
presence of an electric_field. An electric field can increase the number of
free electrons and holes in a semiconductor, thereby changing its conductivity.
The field may be applied by a reverse-biased pân junction, forming a junction
field-effect transistor (JFET) or by an electrode insulated from the bulk
material by an oxide layer, forming a metalâoxideâsemiconductor field-
effect transistor (MOSFET).
The MOSFET, a solid-state device, is the most used semiconductor device today.
The gate electrode is charged to produce an electric field that controls the
conductivity of a "channel" between two terminals, called the source and drain.
Depending on the type of carrier in the channel, the device may be an n-channel
(for electrons) or a p-channel (for holes) MOSFET. Although the MOSFET is named
in part for its "metal" gate, in modern devices polysilicon is typically used
instead.
***** Semiconductor device materials[edit] *****
Main article: Semiconductor_materials
By far, silicon (Si) is the most widely used material in semiconductor devices.
Its combination of low raw material cost, relatively simple processing, and a
useful temperature range makes it currently the best compromise among the
various competing materials. Silicon used in semiconductor device manufacturing
is currently fabricated into boules that are large enough in diameter to allow
the production of 300 mm (12 in.) wafers.
Germanium (Ge) was a widely used early semiconductor material but its thermal
sensitivity makes it less useful than silicon. Today, germanium is often
alloyed with silicon for use in very-high-speed SiGe devices; IBM is a major
producer of such devices.
Gallium_arsenide (GaAs) is also widely used in high-speed devices but so far,
it has been difficult to form large-diameter boules of this material, limiting
the wafer diameter to sizes significantly smaller than silicon wafers thus
making mass production of GaAs devices significantly more expensive than
silicon.
Other less common materials are also in use or under investigation.
Silicon_carbide (SiC) has found some application as the raw material for blue
light-emitting_diodes (LEDs) and is being investigated for use in semiconductor
devices that could withstand very high operating_temperatures and environments
with the presence of significant levels of ionizing_radiation. IMPATT_diodes
have also been fabricated from SiC.
Various indium compounds (indium arsenide, indium antimonide, and indium
phosphide) are also being used in LEDs and solid state laser_diodes. Selenium
sulfide is being studied in the manufacture of photovoltaic solar_cells.
The most common use for organic_semiconductors is organic_light-emitting
diodes.

***** Semiconductor device applications[edit] *****
All transistor types can be used as the building blocks of logic_gates, which
are fundamental in the design of digital_circuits. In digital circuits like
microprocessors, transistors act as on-off switches; in the MOSFET, for
instance, the voltage applied to the gate determines whether the switch is on
or off.
Transistors used for analog_circuits do not act as on-off switches; rather,
they respond to a continuous range of inputs with a continuous range of
outputs. Common analog circuits include amplifiers and oscillators.
Circuits that interface or translate between digital circuits and analog
circuits are known as mixed-signal_circuits.
Power_semiconductor_devices are discrete devices or integrated circuits
intended for high current or high voltage applications. Power integrated
circuits combine IC technology with power semiconductor technology, these are
sometimes referred to as "smart" power devices. Several companies specialize in
manufacturing power semiconductors.
**** Component identifiers[edit] ****
The type_designators of semiconductor devices are often manufacturer specific.
Nevertheless, there have been attempts at creating standards for type codes,
and a subset of devices follow those. For discrete_devices, for example, there
are three standards: JEDEC JESD370B in United States, Pro_Electron in Europe
and Japanese_Industrial_Standards (JI

**** Cat's-whisker detector[edit] ****
Main article: Cat's-whisker_detector
Semiconductors had been used in the electronics field for some time before the
invention of the transistor. Around the turn of the 20th century they were
quite common as detectors in radios, used in a device called a "cat's whisker"
developed by Jagadish_Chandra_Bose and others. These detectors were somewhat
troublesome, however, requiring the operator to move a small tungsten filament
(the whisker) around the surface of a galena (lead sulfide) or carborundum
(silicon carbide) crystal until it suddenly started working.[4] Then, over a
period of a few hours or days, the cat's whisker would slowly stop working and
the process would have to be repeated. At the time their operation was
completely mysterious. After the introduction of the more reliable and
amplified vacuum_tube based radios, the cat's whisker systems quickly
disappeared. The "cat's whisker" is a primitive example of a special type of
diode still popular today, called a Schottky_diode.
**** Metal rectifier[edit] ****
Main article: Metal_rectifier
Another early type of semiconductor device is the metal rectifier in which the
semiconductor is copper_oxide or selenium. Westinghouse_Electric_(1886) was a
major manufacturer of these rectifiers.
**** World War II[edit] ****
During World War II, radar research quickly pushed radar receivers to operate
at ever higher frequencies and the traditional tube based radio receivers no
longer worked well. The introduction of the cavity_magnetron from Britain to
the United States in 1940 during the Tizard_Mission resulted in a pressing need
for a practical high-frequency amplifier.[citation_needed]
On a whim, Russell_Ohl of Bell_Laboratories decided to try a cat's_whisker. By
this point they had not been in use for a number of years, and no one at the
labs had one. After hunting one down at a used radio store in Manhattan, he
found that it worked much better than tube-based systems.
Ohl investigated why the cat's whisker functioned so well. He spent most of
1939 trying to grow more pure versions of the crystals. He soon found that with
higher quality crystals their finicky behaviour went away, but so did their
ability to operate as a radio detector. One day he found one of his purest
crystals nevertheless worked well, and it had a clearly visible crack near the
middle. However as he moved about the room trying to test it, the detector
would mysteriously work, and then stop again. After some study he found that
the behaviour was controlled by the light in the room â more light caused
more conductance in the crystal. He invited several other people to see this
crystal, and Walter_Brattain immediately realized there was some sort of
junction at the crack.
Further research cleared up the remaining mystery. The crystal had cracked
because either side contained very slightly different amounts of the impurities
Ohl could not remove â about 0.2%. One side of the crystal had impurities
that added extra electrons (the carriers of electric current) and made it a
"conductor". The other had impurities that wanted to bind to these electrons,
making it (what he called) an "insulator". Because the two parts of the crystal
were in contact with each other, the electrons could be pushed out of the
conductive side which had extra electrons (soon to be known as the emitter) and
replaced by new ones being provided (from a battery, for instance) where they
would flow into the insulating portion and be collected by the whisker filament
(named the collector). However, when the voltage was reversed the electrons
being pushed into the collector would quickly fill up the "holes" (the
electron-needy impurities), and conduction would stop almost instantly. This
junction of the two crystals (or parts of one crystal) created a solid-state
diode, and the concept soon became known as semiconduction. The mechanism of
action when the diode is off has to do with the separation of charge_carriers
around the junction. This is called a "depletion_region".
**** Development of the diode[edit] ****
Armed with the knowledge of how these new diodes worked, a vigorous effort
began to learn how to build them on demand. Teams at Purdue_University, Bell
Labs, MIT, and the University_of_Chicago all joined forces to build better
crystals. Within a year germanium production had been perfected to the point
where military-grade diodes were being used in most radar sets.
**** Development of the transistor[edit] ****
Main article: History_of_the_transistor
After the war, William_Shockley decided to attempt the building of a triode-
like semiconductor device. He secured funding and lab space, and went to work
on the problem with Brattain and John_Bardeen.
The key to the development of the transistor was the further understanding of
the process of the electron_mobility in a semiconductor. It was realized that
if there were some way to control the flow of the electrons from the emitter to
the collector of this newly discovered diode, an amplifier could be built. For
instance, if contacts are placed on both sides of a single type of crystal,
current will not flow between them through the crystal. However if a third
contact could then "inject" electrons or holes into the material, current would
flow.
Actually doing this appeared to be very difficult. If the crystal were of any
reasonable size, the number of electrons (or holes) required to be injected
would have to be very large, making it less than useful as an amplifier because
it would require a large injection current to start with. That said, the whole
idea of the crystal diode was that the crystal itself could provide the
electrons over a very small distance, the depletion region. The key appeared to
be to place the input and output contacts very close together on the surface of
the crystal on either side of this region.
Brattain started working on building such a device, and tantalizing hints of
amplification continued to appear as the team worked on the problem. Sometimes
the system would work but then stop working unexpectedly. In one instance a
non-working system started working when placed in water. Ohl and Brattain
eventually developed a new branch of quantum_mechanics, which became known as
surface_physics, to account for the behaviour. The electrons in any one piece
of the crystal would migrate about due to nearby charges. Electrons in the
emitters, or the "holes" in the collectors, would cluster at the surface of the
crystal where they could find their opposite charge "floating around" in the
air (or water). Yet they could be pushed away from the surface with the
application of a small amount of charge from any other location on the crystal.
Instead of needing a large supply of injected electrons, a very small number in
the right place on the crystal would accomplish the same thing.
Their understanding solved the problem of needing a very small control area to
some degree. Instead of needing two separate semiconductors connected by a
common, but tiny, region, a single larger surface would serve. The electron-
emitting and collecting leads would both be placed very close together on the
top, with the control lead placed on the base of the crystal. When current
flowed through this "base" lead, the electrons or holes would be pushed out,
across the block of semiconductor, and collect on the far surface. As long as
the emitter and collector were very close together, this should allow enough
electrons or holes between them to allow conduction to start.
**** The first transistor[edit] ****
A stylized replica of the first transistor
The Bell team made many attempts to build such a system with various tools, but
generally failed. Setups where the contacts were close enough were invariably
as fragile as the original cat's whisker detectors had been, and would work
briefly, if at all. Eventually they had a practical breakthrough. A piece of
gold foil was glued to the edge of a plastic wedge, and then the foil was
sliced with a razor at the tip of the triangle. The result was two very closely
spaced contacts of gold. When the wedge was pushed down onto the surface of a
crystal and voltage applied to the other side (on the base of the crystal),
current started to flow from one contact to the other as the base voltage
pushed the electrons away from the base towards the other side near the
contacts. The point-contact transistor had been invented.
While the device was constructed a week earlier, Brattain's notes describe the
first demonstration to higher-ups at Bell Labs on the afternoon of 23 December
1947, often given as the birthdate of the transistor. What is now known as the
"pânâp_point-contact_germanium_transistor" operated as a speech amplifier
with a power gain of 18 in that trial. John_Bardeen, Walter_Houser_Brattain,
and William_Bradford_Shockley were awarded the 1956 Nobel_Prize in physics for
their work.
**** Origin of the term "transistor"[edit] ****
Bell Telephone Laboratories needed a generic name for their new invention:
"Semiconductor Triode", "Solid Triode", "Surface States Triode" [sic], "Crystal
Triode" and "Iotatron" were all considered, but "transistor", coined by John_R.
Pierce, won an internal ballot. The rationale for the name is described in the
following extract from the company's Technical Memoranda (May 28, 1948) [26]
calling for votes:
     Transistor. This is an abbreviated combination of the words
     "transconductance" or "transfer", and "varistor". The device
     logically belongs in the varistor family, and has the
     transconductance or transfer impedance of a device having gain, so
     that this combination is descriptive.
**** Improvements in transistor design[edit] ****
Shockley was upset about the device being credited to Brattain and Bardeen, who
he felt had built it "behind his back" to take the glory. Matters became worse
when Bell Labs lawyers found that some of Shockley's own writings on the
transistor were close enough to those of an earlier 1925 patent by Julius_Edgar
Lilienfeld that they thought it best that his name be left off the patent
application.
Shockley was incensed, and decided to demonstrate who was the real brains of
the operation.[citation_needed] A few months later he invented an entirely new,
considerably more robust, type of transistor with a layer or 'sandwich'
structure. This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all
transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the bipolar_junction_transistor.
With the fragility problems solved, a remaining problem was purity. Making
germanium of the required purity was proving to be a serious problem, and
limited the yield of transistors that actually worked from a given batch of
material. Germanium's sensitivity to temperature also limited its usefulness.
Scientists theorized that silicon would be easier to fabricate, but few
investigated this possibility. Gordon_K._Teal was the first to develop a
working silicon transistor, and his company, the nascent Texas_Instruments,
profited from its technological edge. From the late 1960s most transistors were
silicon-based. Within a few years transistor-based products, most notably
easily portable radios, were appearing on the market.
The static_induction_transistor, the first high frequency transistor, was
invented by Japanese engineers Jun-ichi_Nishizawa and Y. Watanabe in 1950.[5]
It was the fastest transistor through to the 1980s.[6][7]
A major improvement in manufacturing yield came when a chemist advised the
companies fabricating semiconductors to use distilled rather than tap water:
calcium ions present in tap water were the cause of the poor yields. "Zone
melting", a technique using a band of molten material moving through the
crystal, further increased crystal purity.
**** Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)[edit] ****
Main article: MOSFET
Further information: Semiconductor_device_fabrication
In the 1950s, Mohamed_Atalla investigated the surface properties of silicon
semiconductors at Bell_Labs, where he proposed a new method of semiconductor
device_fabrication, coating a silicon_wafer with an insulating layer of silicon
oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon
below, overcoming the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching
the semiconducting layer. This is known as surface passivation, a method that
became critical to the semiconductor_industry as it made possible the mass-
production of silicon integrated_circuits (ICs). Building on his surface
passivation method, he developed the metal_oxide_semiconductor (MOS) process,
which he proposed could be used to build the first working silicon field-effect
transistor (FET).[8][9] The led to the invention of the MOSFET (MOS field-
effect transistor) by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon_Kahng in 1959.[10][11] With its
scalability,[12] and much lower power consumption and higher density than
bipolar_junction_transistors,[13] the MOSFET became the most common type of
transistor in computers, electronics,[9] and communications_technology such as
smartphones.[14] The US_Patent_and_Trademark_Office calls the MOSFET a
"groundbreaking invention that transformed life and culture around the world".
[14]
CMOS (complementary MOS) was invented by Chih-Tang_Sah and Frank_Wanlass at
Fairchild_Semiconductor in 1963.[15] The first report of a floating-gate_MOSFET
was made by Dawon Kahng and Simon_Sze in 1967.[16] FinFET (fin field-effect
transistor), a type of 3D multi-gate MOSFET, was developed by Digh Hisamoto and
his team of researchers at Hitachi_Central_Research_Laboratory in 1989.[17][18]
