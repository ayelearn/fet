Average daily variation in human body temperature
Temperature is a physical_quantity expressing hot and cold. It is measured with
a thermometer calibrated in one or more temperature_scales. The most commonly
used scales are the Celsius_scale (formerly called centigrade) (denoted Ã‚Â°C),
Fahrenheit_scale (denoted Ã‚Â°F), and Kelvin_scale (denoted K). The kelvin (the
word is spelled with a lower-case k) is the unit of temperature in the
International_System_of_Units (SI). The Kelvin scale is widely used in science
and technology.
Theoretically, the coldest a system can be is when its temperature is absolute
zero, at which point the thermal_motion in matter would be zero. However, an
actual physical system or object can never attain a temperature of absolute
zero. Absolute zero is denoted as 0Â K on the Kelvin scale, Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C on the
Celsius scale, and Ã¢ÂˆÂ’459.67Â Ã‚Â°F on the Fahrenheit scale.
For an ideal_gas, temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of
the random microscopic motions of the constituent microscopic particles. This
is now the basis of the definition of the magnitude of the kelvin.
Temperature is important in all fields of natural_science, including physics,
chemistry, Earth_science, medicine, and biology, as well as most aspects of
daily life.[1]

Temperature scales differ in two ways: the point chosen as zero degrees, and
the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale.
The Celsius scale (Ã‚Â°C) is used for common temperature measurements in most of
the world. It is an empirical scale that was developed by a historical
progress, which led to its zero point 0Â Ã‚Â°C being defined by the freezing point
of water, and additional degrees defined so that 100Â Ã‚Â°C was the boiling point
of water, both at sea-level atmospheric pressure. Because of the 100-degree
interval, it was called a centigrade scale.[4] Since the standardization of the
kelvin in the International System of Units, it has subsequently been redefined
in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the Kelvin scale, and so that a
temperature increment of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one
kelvin, though they differ by an additive offset of approximately 273.15.
The United States commonly uses the Fahrenheit scale, on which water freezes at
32Â Ã‚Â°F and boils at 212Â Ã‚Â°F at sea-level atmospheric pressure.
Many scientific measurements use the Kelvin_temperature_scale (unit symbol: K),
named in honor of the Scots-Irish physicist who first defined it. It is a
thermodynamic or absolute_temperature scale. Its zero point, 0Â K, is defined to
coincide with the coldest conceivable temperature (called absolute_zero). Its
degrees are defined through_particle_kinetic_theory.
The process of cooling involves removing energy from a system. When no more
energy can be removed, the system is at absolute zero, though this cannot be
achieved experimentally. Absolute zero is the null point of the thermodynamic
temperature scale, also called absolute temperature. If it were possible to
cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would
cease and they would be at complete rest in this classical sense.
Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still
has zero-point_energy even at absolute zero, because of the uncertainty
principle. Such zero-point energy is not considered "heat-driven" or "thermal"
motion and does not enter into the deÃ¯Â¬Ânition of thermodynamic, or absolute,
temperature.
Until May 2019, the International_System_of_Units (SI) used to define a scale
and unit for the kelvin or thermodynamic_temperature by using the reliably
reproducible temperature of the triple_point of water as a second reference
point (the first reference point being 0Â K at absolute zero). The triple point
is a singular state with its own unique and invariant temperature and pressure,
along with, for a fixed mass of water in a vessel of fixed volume, an
autonomically and stably self-determining partition into three mutually
contacting phases, vapour, liquid, and solid, dynamically depending only on the
total internal energy of the mass of water. Historically, the triple point
temperature of water was defined to be exactly at 273.16 units of the
measurement increment. Nowadays the triple point temperature is an empirically
or approximately measured quantity, numerically evaluated in terms of the
Boltzmann constant. The temperature of absolute zero occurs at 0Â K. That is
approximately equal to Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C (or Ã¢ÂˆÂ’459.67Â Ã‚Â°F). The freezing point of
water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at approximately 273.15Â K =
0Â Ã‚Â°C.
**** Types[edit] ****
There is a variety of kinds of temperature scale. It may be convenient to
classify them as empirically and theoretically based. Empirical temperature
scales are historically older, while theoretically based scales arose in the
middle of the nineteenth century.[5][6]
*** Empirically-based[edit] ***
Empirically based temperature scales rely directly on measurements of simple
physical properties of materials. For example, the length of a column of
mercury, confined in a glass-walled capillary tube, is dependent largely on
temperature, and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer.
Such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature. For
example, above the boiling point of mercury, a mercury-in-glass thermometer is
impracticable. Most materials expand with temperature increase, but some
materials, such as water, contract with temperature increase over some specific
range, and then they are hardly useful as thermometric materials. A material is
of no use as a thermometer near one of its phase-change temperatures, for
example its boiling-point.
In spite of these restrictions, most generally used practical thermometers are
of the empirically based kind. Especially, it was used for calorimetry, which
contributed greatly to the discovery of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, empirical
thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical
physics. Empirically based thermometers, beyond their base as simple direct
measurements of ordinary physical properties of thermometric materials, can be
re-calibrated, by use of theoretical physical reasoning, and this can extend
their range of adequacy.
*** Theoretically-based[edit] ***
Theoretically-based temperature scales are based directly on theoretical
arguments, especially those of thermodynamics, kinetic theory and quantum
mechanics. They rely on theoretical properties of idealized devices and
materials. They are more or less comparable with practically feasible physical
devices and materials. Theoretically based temperature scales are used to
provide calibrating standards for practical empirically based thermometers.
If molecules, or atoms, or electrons,[7][8] are emitted from a material and
their velocities are measured, the spectrum of their velocities often nearly
obeys a theoretical law called the MaxwellÃ¢Â€Â“Boltzmann_distribution, which
gives a well-founded measurement of temperatures for which the law holds.[9]
There have not yet been successful experiments of this same kind that directly
use the FermiÃ¢Â€Â“Dirac_distribution for thermometry, but perhaps that will be
achieved in future.[10]
The speed of sound in a gas can be calculated theoretically from the molecular
character of the gas, from its temperature and pressure, and from the value of
Boltzmann's constant. For a gas of known molecular character and pressure, this
provides a relation between temperature and Boltzmann's constant. Those
quantities can be known or measured more precisely than can the thermodynamic
variables that define the state of a sample of water at its triple point.
Consequently, taking the value of Boltzmann's constant as a primarily defined
reference of exactly defined value, a measurement of the speed of sound can
provide a more precise measurement of the temperature of the gas.[11]
Measurement of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from an ideal three-
dimensional black_body can provide an accurate temperature measurement because
the frequency of maximum spectral radiance of black-body radiation is directly
proportional to the temperature of the black body; this is known as Wien's
displacement_law and has a theoretical explanation in Planck's_law and the
BoseÃ¢Â€Â“Einstein_law.
Measurement of the spectrum of noise-power produced by an electrical resistor
can also provide an accurate temperature measurement. The resistor has two
terminals and is in effect a one-dimensional body. The Bose-Einstein law for
this case indicates that the noise-power is directly proportional to the
temperature of the resistor and to the value of its resistance and to the noise
band-width. In a given frequency band, the noise-power has equal contributions
from every frequency and is called Johnson_noise. If the value of the
resistance is known then the temperature can be found.[12][13]
An ideal material on which a temperature scale might be based is the ideal_gas.
The pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an ideal gas is directly
proportional to its temperature. Some natural gases show so nearly ideal
properties over suitable temperature ranges that they can be used for
thermometry; this was important during the development of thermodynamics and is
still of practical importance today.[14][15] The ideal gas thermometer is,
however, not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics. This is because the
entropy_of_an_ideal_gas at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive
semi-definite quantity, which puts the gas in violation of the third law of
thermodynamics. The physical reason is that the ideal gas law, exactly read,
refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure.[16][17]
[18]
In thermodynamics, the fundamental temperature scale is the Kelvin scale, based
on an ideal cyclic process envisaged for a Carnot_heat_engine.
***** Kinetic theory approach[edit] *****
The magnitude of the kelvin is now defined in terms of kinetic theory, derived
from the value of Boltzmann's_constant. A more thorough account of this is
below at Theoretical_foundation.
Kinetic_theory provides a microscopic account of temperature for some bodies of
material, especially gases, based on macroscopic systems' being composed of
many microscopic particles, such as molecules and ions of various species, the
particles of a species being all alike. It explains macroscopic phenomena
through the classical_mechanics of the microscopic particles. The equipartition
theorem of kinetic theory asserts that each classical degree_of_freedom of a
freely moving particle has an average kinetic energy of kBT/2 where kB denotes
Boltzmann's_constant. The translational motion of the particle has three
degrees of freedom, so that, except at very low temperatures where quantum
effects predominate, the average translational kinetic energy of a freely
moving particle in a system with temperature T will be 3kBT/2.
Molecules, such as oxygen (O2), have more degrees_of_freedom than single
spherical atoms: they undergo rotational and vibrational motions as well as
translations. Heating results in an increase in temperature due to an increase
in the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules. Heating will also
cause, through equipartitioning, the energy associated with vibrational and
rotational modes to increase. Thus a diatomic gas will require more energy
input to increase its temperature by a certain amount, i.e. it will have a
greater heat_capacity than a monatomic gas.
As noted above, the speed of sound in a gas can be calculated from the
molecular character of the gas, from its temperature and pressure, and from the
value of Boltzmann's constant. Taking the value of Boltzmann's constant as a
primarily defined reference of exactly defined value, a measurement of the
speed of sound can provide a more precise measurement of the temperature of the
gas.[11]
It is possible to measure the average kinetic energy of constituent microscopic
particles if they are allowed to escape from the bulk of the system, through a
small hole in the containing wall. The spectrum of velocities has to be
measured, and the average calculated from that. It is not necessarily the case
that the particles that escape and are measured have the same velocity
distribution as the particles that remain in the bulk of the system, but
sometimes a good sample is possible.
***** Thermodynamic approach[edit] *****
Temperature is one of the principal quantities in the study of thermodynamics.
Formerly, the magnitude of the kelvin was defined in thermodynamic terms, but
now, as mentioned above, it is defined in terms of kinetic theory.
**** Kelvin scale and absolute thermodynamic definitions[edit] ****
The Kelvin_scale is called absolute for two reasons. One is that its formal
character is independent of the properties of particular materials. The other
reason is that its zero is in a sense absolute, in that it indicates absence of
microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter, so that
they have a limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature, according to
the third law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, a Kelvin temperature does in
fact have a definite numerical value that has been arbitrarily chosen by
tradition and is dependent on the property of a particular materials; it is
simply less arbitrary than relative "degrees" scales such as Celsius and
Fahrenheit. Being an absolute scale with one fixed point (zero), there is only
one degree of freedom left to arbitrary choice, rather than two as in relative
scales. For the Kelvin scale in modern times, this choice of convention is made
to be that of setting the gasÃ¢Â€Â“liquidÃ¢Â€Â“solid_triple_point_of_water, a point
which can be reliably reproduced as a standard experimental phenomenon, at a
numerical value of 273.16 kelvins. The Kelvin scale is also called the
thermodynamic scale. However, to demonstrate that its numerical value is indeed
arbitrary, it is useful to point out that an alternate, less widely used
absolute temperature scale exists called the Rankine_scale, made to be aligned
with the Fahrenheit_scale as Kelvin is with Celsius.
The thermodynamic definition of temperature is due to Kelvin.
It is framed in terms of an idealized device called a Carnot_engine, imagined
to define a continuous cycle of states of its working body. The cycle is
imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body is
in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. There are four limbs in such a Carnot
cycle. The engine consists of four bodies. The main one is called the working
body. Two of them are called heat reservoirs, so large that their respective
non-deformation variables are not changed by transfer of energy as heat through
a wall permeable only to heat to the working body. The fourth body is able to
exchange energy with the working body only through adiabatic work; it may be
called the work reservoir. The substances and states of the two heat reservoirs
should be chosen so that they are not in thermal equilibrium with one another.
This means that they must be at different fixed temperatures, one, labeled here
with the number 1, hotter than the other, labeled here with the number 2. This
can be tested by connecting the heat reservoirs successively to an auxiliary
empirical thermometric body that starts each time at a convenient fixed
intermediate temperature. The thermometric body should be composed of a
material that has a strictly monotonic relation between its chosen empirical
thermometric variable and the amount of adiabatic isochoric work done on it. In
order to settle the structure and sense of operation of the Carnot cycle, it is
convenient to use such a material also for the working body; because most
materials are of this kind, this is hardly a restriction of the generality of
this definition. The Carnot cycle is considered to start from an initial
condition of the working body that was reached by the completion of a
reversible adiabatic compression. From there, the working body is initially
connected by a wall permeable only to heat to the heat reservoir number 1, so
that during the first limb of the cycle it expands and does work on the work
reservoir. The second limb of the cycle sees the working body expand
adiabatically and reversibly, with no energy exchanged as heat, but more energy
being transferred as work to the work reservoir. The third limb of the cycle
sees the working body connected, through a wall permeable only to heat, to the
heat reservoir 2, contracting and accepting energy as work from the work
reservoir. The cycle is closed by reversible adiabatic compression of the
working body, with no energy transferred as heat, but energy being transferred
to it as work from the work reservoir.
With this set-up, the four limbs of the reversible Carnot_cycle are
characterized by amounts of energy transferred, as work from the working body
to the work reservoir, and as heat from the heat reservoirs to the working
body. The amounts of energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoirs are
measured through the changes in the non-deformation variable of the working
body, with reference to the previously known properties of that body, the
amounts of work done on the work reservoir, and the first law of
thermodynamics. The amounts of energy transferred as heat respectively from
reservoir 1 and from reservoir 2 may then be denoted respectively Q1 and Q2.
Then the absolute or thermodynamic temperatures, T1 and T2, of the reservoirs
are defined so that to be such that
          T  1    /   T  2   = &#x2212;  Q  1    /   Q  2   .       Â Â Â 
      {\displaystyle T_{1}/T_{2}=-Q_{1}/Q_{2}.}  [{\displaystyle T_   Â   (1)
      {1}/T_{2}=-Q_{1}/Q_{2}.}]
Kelvin's original work postulating absolute temperature was published in 1848.
It was based on the work of Carnot, before the formulation of the first law of
thermodynamics. Kelvin wrote in his 1848 paper that his scale was absolute in
the sense that it was defined "independently of the properties of any
particular kind of matter". His definitive publication, which sets out the
definition just stated, was printed in 1853, a paper read in 1851.[19][20][21]
[22]
This definition rests on the physical assumption that there are readily
available walls permeable only to heat. In his detailed definition of a wall
permeable only to heat, CarathÃƒÂ©odory includes several ideas. The non-
deformation state variable of a closed system is represented as a real number.
A state of thermal equilibrium between two closed systems connected by a wall
permeable only to heat means that a certain mathematical relation holds between
the state variables, including the respective non-deformation variables, of
those two systems (that particular mathematical relation is regarded by
Buchdahl as a preferred statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics).[23]
Also, referring to thermal contact equilibrium, "whenever each of the systems
S1 and S2 is made to reach equilibrium with a third system S3 under identical
conditions, the systems S1 and S2 are in mutual equilibrium."[24] It may be
viewed as a re-statement of the principle stated by Maxwell in the words: "All
heat is of the same kind."[25] This physical idea is also expressed by Bailyn
as a possible version of the zeroth law of thermodynamics: "All diathermal
walls are equivalent."[26] Thus the present definition of thermodynamic
temperature rests on the zeroth law of thermodynamics. Explicitly, this present
definition of thermodynamic temperature also rests on the first law of
thermodynamics, for the determination of amounts of energy transferred as heat.
Implicitly for this definition, the second law of thermodynamics provides
information that establishes the virtuous character of the temperature so
defined. It provides that any working substance that complies with the
requirement stated in this definition will lead to the same ratio of
thermodynamic temperatures, which in this sense is universal, or absolute. The
second law of thermodynamics also provides that the thermodynamic temperature
defined in this way is positive, because this definition requires that the heat
reservoirs not be in thermal equilibrium with one another, and the cycle can be
imagined to operate only in one sense if net work is to be supplied to the work
reservoir.
Numerical details are settled by making one of the heat reservoirs a cell at
the triple point of water, which is defined to have an absolute temperature of
273.16 K.[27] The zeroth law of thermodynamics allows this definition to be
used to measure the absolute or thermodynamic temperature of an arbitrary body
of interest, by making the other heat reservoir have the same temperature as
the body of interest.
**** Intensive variability[edit] ****
In thermodynamic terms, temperature is an intensive_variable because it is
equal to a differential_coefficient of one extensive_variable with respect to
another, for a given body. It thus has the dimensions of a ratio of two
extensive variables. In thermodynamics, two bodies are often considered as
connected by contact with a common wall, which has some specific permeability
properties. Such specific permeability can be referred to a specific intensive
variable. An example is a diathermic wall that is permeable only to heat; the
intensive variable for this case is temperature. When the two bodies have been
in contact for a very long time, and have settled to a permanent steady state,
the relevant intensive variables are equal in the two bodies; for a diathermal
wall, this statement is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.[28]
[29][30]
In particular, when the body is described by stating its internal_energy U, an
extensive variable, as a function of its entropy S, also an extensive variable,
and other state variables V, N, with U = U (S, V, N), then the temperature is
equal to the partial_derivative of the internal energy with respect to the
entropy:[29][30][31]
         T =   (    &#x2202; U   &#x2202; S    )   V , N   .
      {\displaystyle T=\left({\frac {\partial U}{\partial S}}\right)_ Â Â Â (2)
      {V,N}.}  [{\displaystyle T=\left({\frac {\partial U}{\partial     Â 
      S}}\right)_{V,N}.}]
Likewise, when the body is described by stating its entropy S as a function of
its internal energy U, and other state variables V, N, with S = S (U, V, N),
then the reciprocal of the temperature is equal to the partial derivative of
the entropy with respect to the internal energy:[29][31][32]
           1 T   =   (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; U    )   V , N   .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{T}}=\left({\frac {\partial S}         Â Â Â (3)
      {\partial U}}\right)_{V,N}.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1}          Â 
      {T}}=\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial U}}\right)_{V,N}.}]
The above definition, equation (1), of the absolute temperature is due to
Kelvin. It refers to systems closed to transfer of matter, and has special
emphasis on directly experimental procedures. A presentation of thermodynamics
by Gibbs starts at a more abstract level and deals with systems open to the
transfer of matter; in this development of thermodynamics, the equations (2)
and (3) above are actually alternative definitions of temperature.[33]
**** Local thermodynamic equilibrium[edit] ****
Real world bodies are often not in thermodynamic equilibrium and not
homogeneous. For study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics, a
body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into 'cells' of
small size. If classical thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for matter are
fulfilled to good approximation in such a 'cell', then it is homogeneous and a
temperature exists for it. If this is so for every 'cell' of the body, then
local_thermodynamic_equilibrium is said to prevail throughout the body.[34][35]
[36][37][38]
It makes good sense, for example, to say of the extensive variable U, or of the
extensive variable S, that it has a density per unit volume, or a quantity per
unit mass of the system, but it makes no sense to speak of density of
temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the
system. On the other hand, it makes no sense to speak of the internal energy at
a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes good
sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can
vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic
equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.
Thus, when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails in a body, temperature can
be regarded as a spatially varying local property in that body, and this is
because temperature is an intensive variable.

Temperature is a measure of a quality of a state of a material.[39] The quality
may be regarded as a more abstract entity than any particular temperature scale
that measures it, and is called hotness by some writers.[40] The quality of
hotness refers to the state of material only in a particular locality, and in
general, apart from bodies held in a steady state of thermodynamic equilibrium,
hotness varies from place to place. It is not necessarily the case that a
material in a particular place is in a state that is steady and nearly
homogeneous enough to allow it to have a well-defined hotness or temperature.
Hotness may be represented abstractly as a one-dimensional manifold. Every
valid temperature scale has its own one-to-one map into the hotness manifold.
[41][42]
When two systems in thermal contact are at the same temperature no heat
transfers between them. When a temperature difference does exist heat flows
spontaneously from the warmer system to the colder system until they are in
thermal_equilibrium. Such heat transfer occurs by conduction or by thermal
radiation.[43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50]
Experimental physicists, for example Galileo and Newton,[51] found that there
are indefinitely many empirical_temperature_scales. Nevertheless, the zeroth
law_of_thermodynamics says that they all measure the same quality. This means
that for a body in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, every
correctly calibrated thermometer, of whatever kind, that measures the
temperature of the body, records one and the same temperature. For a body that
is not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, different
thermometers can record different temperatures, depending respectively on the
mechanisms of operation of the thermometers.
**** Bodies in thermodynamic equilibrium[edit] ****
For experimental physics, hotness means that, when comparing any two given
bodies in their respective separate thermodynamic_equilibria, any two suitably
given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to
which is the hotter of the two given bodies, or that they have the same
temperature.[52] This does not require the two thermometers to have a linear
relation between their numerical scale readings, but it does require that the
relation between their numerical readings shall be strictly_monotonic.[53][54]
A definite sense of greater hotness can be had, independently of calorimetry,
of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien's
displacement_law of thermal_radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal
radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the
maximum of its frequency_spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can
have values that tend_to_zero. Thermal radiation is initially defined for a
cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium. These physical facts justify a
mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional
manifold. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for
bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium.[5][41][42][55][56]
Except for a system undergoing a first-order phase_change such as the melting
of ice, as a closed system receives heat, without change in its volume and
without change in external force fields acting on it, its temperature rises.
For a system undergoing such a phase change so slowly that departure from
thermodynamic equilibrium can be neglected, its temperature remains constant as
the system is supplied with latent_heat. Conversely, a loss of heat from a
closed system, without phase change, without change of volume, and without
change in external force fields acting on it, decreases its temperature.[57]
**** Bodies in a steady state but not in thermodynamic equilibrium[edit] ****
While for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium states, the notion of
temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of
two bodies is the hotter or that they are at the same temperature, this
requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in
thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical
thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then at
least one of the bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic
temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical
thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and
temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in
non-equilibrium_thermodynamics.
**** Bodies not in a steady state[edit] ****
When a body is not in a steady state, then the notion of temperature becomes
even less safe than for a body in a steady state not in thermodynamic
equilibrium. This is also a matter for study in non-equilibrium_thermodynamics.
**** Thermodynamic equilibrium axiomatics[edit] ****
For axiomatic treatment of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, it has
become customary to refer to a zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics. The customarily
stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which
when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to
have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish
temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more
physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a
chart on a hotness manifold.[41][56][58] While the zeroth law permits the
definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the second_law
of_thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred, absolute
temperature, unique up to an arbitrary scale factor, whence called the
thermodynamic_temperature.[5][41][59][60][61][62] If internal_energy is
considered as a function of the volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in
thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the
partial derivative of internal_energy with respect the entropy at constant
volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is absolute_zero at which
the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute
temperature described by the model, the third_law_of_thermodynamics postulates
that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.
***** Heat capacity[edit] *****
See also: Heat_capacity and Calorimetry
When an energy transfer to or from a body is only as heat, the state of the
body changes. Depending on the surroundings and the walls separating them from
the body, various changes are possible in the body. They include chemical
reactions, increase of pressure, increase of temperature, and phase change. For
each kind of change under specified conditions, the heat capacity is the ratio
of the quantity of heat transferred to the magnitude of the change. For
example, if the change is an increase in temperature at constant volume, with
no phase change and no chemical change, then the temperature of the body rises
and its pressure increases. The quantity of heat transferred, ÃÂ”Q, divided by
the observed temperature change, ÃÂ”T, is the body's heat_capacity at constant
volume:
          C  V   =    &#x0394; Q   &#x0394; T    .   {\displaystyle C_{V}=
      {\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta T}}.}  [{\displaystyle C_{V}={\frac {\Delta Q}
      {\Delta T}}.}]
If heat capacity is measured for a well defined amount_of_substance, the
specific_heat is the measure of the heat required to increase the temperature
of such a unit quantity by one unit of temperature. For example, to raise the
temperature of water by one kelvin (equal to one degree Celsius) requires 4186
joules per kilogram (J/kg).
***** Measurement[edit] *****
A typical Celsius thermometer measures a winter day temperature of Ã¢ÂˆÂ’17Â Ã‚Â°C
See also: Timeline_of_temperature_and_pressure_measurement_technology,
International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990, and Comparison_of_temperature_scales
Temperature_measurement using modern scientific thermometers and temperature
scales goes back at least as far as the early 18th century, when Gabriel
Fahrenheit adapted a thermometer (switching to mercury) and a scale both
developed by Ole_Christensen_RÃƒÂ¸mer. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use in the
United States for non-scientific applications.
Temperature is measured with thermometers that may be calibrated to a variety
of temperature_scales. In most of the world (except for Belize, Myanmar,
Liberia and the United_States), the Celsius scale is used for most temperature
measuring purposes. Most scientists measure temperature using the Celsius scale
and thermodynamic temperature using the Kelvin scale, which is the Celsius
scale offset so that its null point is 0Â K = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C, or absolute_zero.
Many engineering fields in the US, notably high-tech and US federal
specifications (civil and military), also use the Kelvin and Celsius scales.
Other engineering fields in the US also rely upon the Rankine_scale (a shifted
Fahrenheit scale) when working in thermodynamic-related disciplines such as
combustion.
**** Units[edit] ****
The basic unit of temperature in the International_System_of_Units (SI) is the
Kelvin. It has the symbol K.
For everyday applications, it is often convenient to use the Celsius scale, in
which 0Â Ã‚Â°C corresponds very closely to the freezing_point of water and 100Â Ã‚Â°C
is its boiling_point at sea level. Because liquid droplets commonly exist in
clouds at sub-zero temperatures, 0Â Ã‚Â°C is better defined as the melting point
of ice. In this scale a temperature difference of 1 degree Celsius is the same
as a 1kelvin increment, but the scale is offset by the temperature at which ice
melts (273.15Â K).
By international agreement[63] the Kelvin and Celsius scales were defined by
two fixing points: absolute_zero and the triple_point of Vienna_Standard_Mean
Ocean_Water, which is water specially prepared with a specified blend of
hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Absolute zero is defined as precisely 0Â K and
Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C. It is the temperature at which all classical translational
motion of the particles comprising matter ceases and they are at complete rest
in the classical model. Quantum-mechanically, however, zero-point motion
remains and has an associated energy, the zero-point_energy. Matter is in its
ground_state,[64] and contains no thermal_energy. The triple point of water is
defined as 273.16Â K and 0.01Â Ã‚Â°C. This definition served the following
purposes: it fixes the magnitude of the kelvin as being precisely 1 part in
273.16 parts of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of
water; it establishes that one kelvin has precisely the same magnitude as one
degree on the Celsius scale; and it establishes the difference between the null
points of these scales as being 273.15Â K (0Â K = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C and 273.16Â K =
0.01Â Ã‚Â°C). Since 2019, there has been a new definition based on the Boltzmann
constant.[65] But the scales are virtually unchanged.
In the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is widely used. On this scale the
freezing point of water corresponds to 32Â Ã‚Â°F and the boiling point to 212Â Ã‚Â°F.
The Rankine scale, still used in fields of chemical engineering in the US, is
an absolute scale based on the Fahrenheit increment.

*** Plasma physics[edit] ***
The field of plasma_physics deals with phenomena of electromagnetic nature that
involve very high temperatures. It is customary to express temperature as
energy in units of electronvolts (eV) or kiloelectronvolts (keV). The energy,
which has a different dimension from temperature, is then calculated as the
product of the Boltzmann_constant and temperature,     E =  k  B   T
{\displaystyle E=k_{B}T}  [E=k_{B}T]. Then, 1 eV corresponds to 11605Â K. In the
study of QCD_matter one routinely encounters temperatures of the order of a few
hundred MeV, equivalent to about 1012Â K.
***** Theoretical foundation[edit] *****
See also: Thermodynamic_temperature
Historically, there are several scientific approaches to the explanation of
temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic
empirical variables that can be measured in a laboratory; the kinetic_theory_of
gases which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution
of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based
on statistical_physics and quantum_mechanics. In addition, rigorous and purely
mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical
thermodynamics and temperature.[66] Statistical physics provides a deeper
understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives
macroscopic properties from statistical averages of microscopic states,
including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical
description, using natural_units, temperature may be measured directly in units
of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science,
technology, and commerce, such as the modern metric_system of units, the
macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the Boltzmann
constant, a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic
mean kinetic energy.
The microscopic description in statistical_mechanics is based on a model that
analyzes a system into its fundamental particles of matter or into a set of
classical or quantum-mechanical oscillators and considers the system as a
statistical_ensemble of microstates. As a collection of classical material
particles, temperature is a measure of the mean energy of motion, called
kinetic_energy, of the particles, whether in solids, liquids, gases, or
plasmas. The kinetic energy, a concept of classical_mechanics, is half the mass
of a particle times its speed squared. In this mechanical interpretation of
thermal motion, the kinetic energies of material particles may reside in the
velocity of the particles of their translational or vibrational motion or in
the inertia of their rotational modes. In monatomic perfect_gases and,
approximately, in most gases, temperature is a measure of the mean particle
kinetic energy. It also determines the probability distribution function of the
energy. In condensed matter, and particularly in solids, this purely mechanical
description is often less useful and the oscillator model provides a better
description to account for quantum mechanical phenomena. Temperature determines
the statistical occupation of the microstates of the ensemble. The microscopic
definition of temperature is only meaningful in the thermodynamic_limit,
meaning for large ensembles of states or particles, to fulfill the requirements
of the statistical model.
The kinetic energy is also considered as a component of thermal_energy. The
thermal energy may be partitioned into independent components attributed to the
degrees_of_freedom of the particles or to the modes of oscillators in a
thermodynamic_system. In general, the number of these degrees of freedom that
are available for the equipartitioning of energy depends on the temperature,
i.e. the energy region of the interactions under consideration. For solids, the
thermal energy is associated primarily with the vibrations of its atoms or
molecules about their equilibrium position. In an ideal_monatomic_gas, the
kinetic energy is found exclusively in the purely translational motions of the
particles. In other systems, vibrational and rotational motions also contribute
degrees of freedom.
**** Kinetic theory of gases[edit] ****
A theoretical understanding of temperature in an ideal gas can be obtained from
the Kinetic_theory.
Maxwell and Boltzmann developed a kinetic_theory that yields a fundamental
understanding of temperature in gases.[67] This theory also explains the ideal
gas law and the observed heat capacity of monatomic (or 'noble') gases.[68][69]
[70]
Plots of pressure vs temperature for three different gas samples extrapolated
to absolute zero
The ideal_gas_law is based on observed empirical_relationships between pressure
(p), volume (V), and temperature (T), and was recognized long before the
kinetic theory of gases was developed (see Boyle's and Charles's laws). The
ideal gas law states:[71]
         p V = n R T ,   {\displaystyle pV=nRT,}  [{\displaystyle pV=nRT,}]
where n is the number of moles of gas and
RÂ =Â 8.314462618...Â JÃ¢Â‹Â…molÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1Ã¢Â‹Â…KÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1[72] is the gas_constant.
This relationship gives us our first hint that there is an absolute_zero on the
temperature scale, because it only holds if the temperature is measured on an
absolute scale such as Kelvin's. The ideal_gas_law allows one to measure
temperature on this absolute scale using the gas_thermometer. The temperature
in kelvins can be defined as the pressure in pascals of one mole of gas in a
container of one cubic meter, divided by the gas constant.
Although it is not a particularly convenient device, the gas_thermometer
provides an essential theoretical basis by which all thermometers can be
calibrated. As a practical matter, it is not possible to use a gas thermometer
to measure absolute zero temperature since the gases tend to condense into a
liquid long before the temperature reaches zero. It is possible, however, to
extrapolate to absolute zero by using the ideal gas law, as shown in the
figure.
The kinetic theory assumes that pressure is caused by the force associated with
individual atoms striking the walls, and that all energy is translational
kinetic_energy. Using a sophisticated symmetry argument,[73] Boltzmann deduced
what is now called the MaxwellÃ¢Â€Â“Boltzmann_probability_distribution function
for the velocity of particles in an ideal gas. From that probability
distribution function, the average kinetic_energy (per particle) of a monatomic
ideal_gas is[69][74]
          E  k   =   1 2   m  v  rms   2   =   3 2   k T ,   {\displaystyle E_
      {\text{k}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv_{\text{rms}}^{2}={\frac {3}{2}}kT,}  [
      {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv_{\text{rms}}^{2}={\frac {3}
      {2}}kT,}]
where the Boltzmann_constant k is the ideal_gas_constant divided by the
Avogadro_number, and      v  rms   =   &#x27E8;  v  2   &#x27E9;
{\displaystyle v_{\text{rms}}={\sqrt {\langle v^{2}\rangle }}}  [{\displaystyle
v_{\text{rms}}={\sqrt {\langle v^{2}\rangle }}}] is the root-mean-square_speed.
Thus the ideal gas law states that internal_energy is directly proportional to
temperature.[75] This direct proportionality between temperature and internal
energy is a special case of the equipartition_theorem, and holds only in the
classical limit of an ideal_gas. It does not hold for most substances, although
it is true that temperature is a monotonic (non-decreasing) function of
internal_energy.
**** Zeroth law of thermodynamics[edit] ****
Main article: Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics
When two otherwise isolated bodies are connected together by a rigid physical
path impermeable to matter, there is spontaneous transfer of energy as heat
from the hotter to the colder of them. Eventually, they reach a state of mutual
thermal_equilibrium, in which heat transfer has ceased, and the bodies'
respective state variables have settled to become unchanging.
One statement of the zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics is that if two systems are
each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal
equilibrium with each other.
This statement helps to define temperature but it does not, by itself, complete
the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness
of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a one-
dimensional_manifold, stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law
is stated to include the existence of a unique universal hotness manifold, and
of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical
temperature.[58] To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have
a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable,
such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An
exceptionally suitable system is the ideal_gas, which can provide a temperature
scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined on
the basis of the second law of thermodynamics.
**** Second law of thermodynamics[edit] ****
Main article: Second_law_of_thermodynamics
In the previous section certain properties of temperature were expressed by the
zeroth law of thermodynamics. It is also possible to define temperature in
terms of the second_law_of_thermodynamics which deals with entropy. The second
law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase
in the entropy of the universe. This can be understood in terms of probability.
For example, in a series of coin tosses, a perfectly ordered system would be
one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails.
This means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin tosses, there is only one
set of toss outcomes possible: the set in which 100% of tosses come up the
same. On the other hand, there are multiple combinations that can result in
disordered or mixed systems, where some fraction are heads and the rest tails.
A disordered system can be 90% heads and 10% tails, or it could be 98% heads
and 2% tails, etcetera. As the number of coin tosses increases, the number of
possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases.
For a very large number of coin tosses, the combinations to ~50% heads and ~50%
tails dominate and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50
becomes extremely unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of
maximum disorder or entropy.
It has been previously stated that temperature governs the transfer of heat
between two systems and it was just shown that the universe tends to progress
so as to maximize entropy, which is expected of any natural system. Thus, it is
expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy. To
find this relationship, the relationship between heat, work and temperature is
first considered. A heat_engine is a device for converting thermal energy into
mechanical energy, resulting in the performance of work, and analysis of the
Carnot_heat_engine provides the necessary relationships. The work from a heat
engine corresponds to the difference between the heat put into the system at
the high temperature, qH and the heat ejected at the low temperature, qC. The
efficiency is the work divided by the heat put into the system:
          efficiency  =    w  c y    q  H     =     q  H   &#x2212;
      q  C     q  H     = 1 &#x2212;    q  C    q  H     ,
      {\displaystyle {\text{efficiency}}={\frac {w_{cy}}{q_{H}}}=   Â Â Â (4)
      {\frac {q_{H}-q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=1-{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}},}  [      Â 
      {\displaystyle {\text{efficiency}}={\frac {w_{cy}}{q_{H}}}=
      {\frac {q_{H}-q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=1-{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}},}]
where wcy is the work done per cycle. The efficiency depends only on qC/qH.
Because qC and qH correspond to heat transfer at the temperatures TC and TH
respectively, qC/qH should be some function of these temperatures:
            q  C    q  H     = f (  T  H   ,  T  C   ) .        Â Â Â 
      {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=f(T_{H},T_{C}).}  [   Â   (5)
      {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=f(T_{H},T_{C}).}]
Carnot's_theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same
heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, a heat engine operating between T1
and T3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one
between T1 and T2, and the second between T2 and T3. This can only be the case
if
          q  13   =     q  1    q  2      q  2    q  3      ,   {\displaystyle
      q_{13}={\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{q_{2}q_{3}}},}  [{\displaystyle q_{13}={\frac
      {q_{1}q_{2}}{q_{2}q_{3}}},}]
which implies
          q  13   = f (  T  1   ,  T  3   ) = f (  T  1   ,  T  2   ) f (  T  2
      ,  T  3   ) .   {\displaystyle q_{13}=f(T_{1},T_{3})=f(T_{1},T_{2})f(T_
      {2},T_{3}).}  [{\displaystyle q_{13}=f(T_{1},T_{3})=f(T_{1},T_{2})f(T_
      {2},T_{3}).}]
Since the first function is independent of T2, this temperature must cancel on
the right side, meaning f(T1,T3) is of the form g(T1)/g(T3) (i.e. f(T1,T3) = f
(T1,T2)f(T2,T3) = g(T1)/g(T2)Ã‚Â· g(T2)/g(T3) = g(T1)/g(T3)), where g is a
function of a single temperature. A temperature scale can now be chosen with
the property that
            q  C    q  H     =    T  C    T  H     .   {\displaystyle Â Â Â 
      {\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}={\frac {T_{C}}{T_{H}}}.}  [                Â   (6)
      {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}={\frac {T_{C}}{T_{H}}}.}]
Substituting (6) back into (4) gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms
of temperature:
          efficiency  = 1 &#x2212;    q  C    q  H     = 1 &#x2212;
      T  C    T  H     .   {\displaystyle {\text{efficiency}}=1-     Â Â Â 
      {\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=1-{\frac {T_{C}}{T_{H}}}.}  [             Â   (7)
      {\displaystyle {\text{efficiency}}=1-{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=1-
      {\frac {T_{C}}{T_{H}}}.}]
For TC = 0 K the efficiency is 100% and that efficiency becomes greater than
100% below 0 K. Since an efficiency greater than 100% violates the first law of
thermodynamics, this implies that 0 K is the minimum possible temperature. In
fact the lowest temperature ever obtained in a macroscopic system was 20 nK,
which was achieved in 1995 at NIST. Subtracting the right hand side of (5) from
the middle portion and rearranging gives
            q  H    T  H     &#x2212;    q  C    T  C     = 0 ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{H}}{T_{H}}}-{\frac {q_{C}}{T_{C}}}=0,}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{H}}{T_{H}}}-{\frac {q_{C}}{T_{C}}}=0,}]
where the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the system. This
relationship suggests the existence of a state function, S, defined by
         d S =    d  q  rev    T   ,   {\displaystyle dS={\frac {dq_ Â Â Â 
      {\text{rev}}}{T}},}  [{\displaystyle dS={\frac {dq_{\text        Â   (8)
      {rev}}}{T}},}]
where the subscript indicates a reversible process. The change of this state
function around any cycle is zero, as is necessary for any state function. This
function corresponds to the entropy of the system, which was described
previously. Rearranging (8) gives a formula for temperature in terms of fictive
infinitesimal quasi-reversible elements of entropy and heat:
         T =    d  q  rev     d S    .   {\displaystyle T={\frac {dq_ Â Â Â 
      {\text{rev}}}{dS}}.}  [{\displaystyle T={\frac {dq_{\text         Â   (9)
      {rev}}}{dS}}.}]
For a system, where entropy S(E) is a function of its energy E, the temperature
T is given by
          T  &#x2212; 1   =   d  d E    S ( E ) ,   {\displaystyle Â Â Â 
      T^{-1}={\frac {d}{dE}}S(E),}  [{\displaystyle T^{-1}={\frac    Â   (10)
      {d}{dE}}S(E),}]
i.e. the reciprocal of the temperature is the rate of increase of entropy with
respect to energy.
**** Definition from statistical mechanics[edit] ****
Statistical_mechanics defines temperature based on a system's fundamental
degrees of freedom. Eq.(10) is the defining relation of temperature. Eq. (9)
can be derived from the principles underlying the fundamental_thermodynamic
relation.
**** Generalized temperature from single-particle statistics[edit] ****
It is possible to extend the definition of temperature even to systems of few
particles, like in a quantum_dot. The generalized temperature is obtained by
considering time ensembles instead of configuration-space ensembles given in
statistical mechanics in the case of thermal and particle exchange between a
small system of fermions (N even less than 10) with a single/double-occupancy
system. The finite quantum grand_canonical_ensemble,[76] obtained under the
hypothesis of ergodicity and orthodicity,[77] allows expressing the generalized
temperature from the ratio of the average time of occupation      &#x03C4;  1
{\displaystyle \tau _{1}}  [\tau _{1}] and      &#x03C4;  2     {\displaystyle
\tau _{2}}  [\tau _{2}] of the single/double-occupancy system:[78]
         T =  k  &#x2212; 1   ln &#x2061; 2    &#x03C4;  2    &#x03C4;  1
      (  E &#x2212;  E  F    (  1 +   3  2 N     )   )  ,   {\displaystyle T=k^
      {-1}\ln 2{\frac {\tau _{2}}{\tau _{1}}}\left(E-E_{\text{F}}\left(1+{\frac
      {3}{2N}}\right)\right),}  [{\displaystyle T=k^{-1}\ln 2{\frac {\tau _{2}}
      {\tau _{1}}}\left(E-E_{\text{F}}\left(1+{\frac {3}{2N}}\right)\right),}]
where EF is the Fermi_energy. This generalized temperature tends to the
ordinary temperature when N goes to infinity.
**** Negative temperature[edit] ****
Main article: Negative_temperature
On the empirical temperature scales that are not referenced to absolute zero, a
negative temperature is one below the zero-point of the scale used. For
example, dry_ice has a sublimation temperature of Ã¢ÂˆÂ’78.5Â Ã‚Â°C which is
equivalent to Ã¢ÂˆÂ’109.3Â Ã‚Â°F. On the absolute kelvin scale this temperature is
194.6Â K. No body can be brought to exactly 0 K (the coldest possible
temperature) by any finite practicable process; this is a consequence of the
third_law_of_thermodynamics.
However, when there is an upper limit of energy a system attain, it is possible
to obtain a negative_temperature on the absolute scale. Such negative
temperatures are in fact hotter than any positive temperature and can be
achieved by heating the system past a point of infinite temperature. As the
energy in such systems increases, the entropy increases for some range, but
eventually attains a maximum value at a critical temperature and then begins to
decrease as the highest energy states begin to fill. At the point of maximum
entropy, the temperature function shows the behavior of a singularity, because
the slope of the entropy function decreases to zero and then turns negative.
Since temperature is the inverse of the derivative of the entropy, the
temperature goes to positive infinity at this point, switching to negative
infinity as the slope turns negative.[79] When brought into contact with a
system at a positive temperature, energy will be transferred as heat from the
negative temperature system to the positive temperature system.

 111. ^ Based on a computer model that predicted a peak internal temperature of
      30Â MeV (350Â GK) during the merger of a binary neutron star system (which
      produces a gammaÃ¢Â€Â“ray burst). The neutron stars in the model were 1.2
      and 1.6 solar masses respectively, were roughly 20Â km in diameter, and
      were orbiting around their barycenter (common center of mass) at about
      390Â Hz during the last several milliseconds before they completely
      merged. The 350Â GK portion was a small volume located at the pair's
      developing common core and varied from roughly 1 to 7Â km across over a
      time span of around 5Â ms. Imagine two city-sized objects of unimaginable
      density orbiting each other at the same frequency as the G4 musical note
      (the 28th white key on a piano). It's also noteworthy that at 350 GK, the
      average neutron has a vibrational speed of 30% the speed of light and a
      relativistic mass (m) 5% greater than its rest mass (m0).Â  Torus
