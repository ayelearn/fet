Caliper detail view
A caliper (British_spelling also calliper, or in plurale_tantum sense a pair of
calipers) is a device used to measure the distance between two opposite sides
of an object. Many types of calipers permit reading out a measurement on a
ruled scale, a dial, or a digital display. But a caliper can be as simple as a
compass with inward or outward-facing points. The tips of the caliper are
adjusted to fit across the points to be measured and then the caliper is then
removed and the distance read by measuring between the tips with a measuring
tool, such as a ruler.
It is used in many fields such as mechanical_engineering, metalworking,
forestry, woodworking, science and medicine.

***** Nomenclature variants[edit] *****
A plurale_tantum sense of the word "calipers" coexists in natural usage with
the regular noun sense of "caliper". That is, sometimes a caliper is treated
cognitively like a pair of glasses or a pair of scissors, resulting in a phrase
such as "hand me those calipers" or "those calipers are mine" in reference to
one unit.
Also existing colloquially but not in formal usage is referring to a vernier
caliper as a "vernier" or a "pair of verniers". In imprecise colloquial usage,
some speakers extend this even to dial calipers, although they involve no
vernier scale.
In machine-shop usage, the term "caliper" is often used in contradistinction to
"micrometer", even though outside micrometers are technically a form of
caliper. In this usage, "caliper" implies only the form_factor of the vernier
or dial caliper (or its digital counterpart).
***** History[edit] *****
The earliest caliper has been found in the Greek Giglio wreck near the Italian
coast. The ship find dates to the 6th century BC. The wooden piece already
featured a fixed and a movable jaw.[1][2] Although rare finds, caliper remained
in use by the Greeks and Romans.[2][3]
A bronze caliper, dating from 9 AD, was used for minute measurements during the
Chinese Xin_dynasty. The caliper had an inscription stating that it was "made
on a gui-you day at new moon of the first month of the first year of the
Shijian guo period." The calipers included a "slot and pin" and "graduated in
inches and tenths of an inch."[4][5]
Caliper with graduated bow 0â10 mm
The modern vernier caliper, reading to thousandths of an inch, was invented by
American Joseph R. Brown in 1851. It was the first practical tool for exact
measurements that could be sold at a price within the reach of ordinary
machinists.[6]
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Inside caliper[edit] ****
Two inside calipers
The inside calipers are used to measure the internal size of an object.
    * The upper caliper in the image (at the right) requires manual adjustment
      prior to fitting. Fine setting of this caliper type is performed by
      tapping the caliper legs lightly on a handy surface until they will
      almost pass over the object. A light push against the resistance of the
      central pivot screw then spreads the legs to the correct dimension and
      provides the required, consistent feel that ensures a repeatable
      measurement.
    * The lower caliper in the image has an adjusting screw that permits it to
      be carefully adjusted without removal of the tool from the workpiece.
**** Outside caliper[edit] ****
Three outside calipers.
Outside calipers are used to measure the external size of an object.
The same observations and technique apply to this type of caliper, as for the
above inside caliper. With some understanding of their limitations and usage,
these instruments can provide a high degree of accuracy and repeatability. They
are especially useful when measuring over very large distances; consider if the
calipers are used to measure a large diameter pipe. A vernier caliper does not
have the depth capacity to straddle this large diameter while at the same time
reach the outermost points of the pipe's diameter. They are made from high
carbon steel.
**** Divider caliper[edit] ****
Main article: Compass_(drafting)
A pair of dividers
In the metalworking field, a divider caliper, popularly called a compass, is
used in the process of marking_out locations. The points are sharpened so that
they act as scribers, one leg can then be placed in the dimple created by a
center_or_prick_punch and the other leg pivoted so that it scribes a line on
the workpiece's surface, thus forming an arc or circle.
A divider caliper is also used to measure a distance between two points on a
map. The two caliper's ends are brought to the two points whose distance is
being measured. The caliper's opening is then either measured on a separate
ruler and then converted to the actual distance, or it is measured directly on
a scale drawn on the map. On a nautical_chart the distance is often measured on
the latitude scale appearing on the sides of the map: one minute of arc of
latitude is approximately one nautical_mile or 1852 metres.
Dividers are also used in the medical profession. An ECG (also EKG) caliper
transfers distance on an electrocardiogram; in conjunction with the appropriate
scale, the heart rate can be determined. A pocket caliper version was invented
by cardiologist Robert A. Mackin.[7]
**** Oddleg caliper[edit] ****
Oddleg calipers
Oddleg calipers, Hermaphrodite calipers, or Oddleg jennys, as pictured on the
left, are generally used to scribe a line at a set distance from the edge of a
workpiece. The bent leg is used to run along the workpiece edge while the
scriber makes its mark at a predetermined distance, this ensures a line
parallel to the edge.
In the diagram at left, the uppermost caliper has a slight shoulder in the bent
leg allowing it to sit on the edge more securely, the lower caliper lacks this
feature but has a renewable scriber that can be adjusted for wear, as well as
being replaced when excessively worn.
**** Vernier caliper[edit] ****
Main article: Vernier_scale
Diagram of Vernier calipers. The labeled parts are
   1. Outside large jaws: used to measure external diameter or width of an
      object
   2. Inside small jaws: used to measure internal diameter of an object
   3. Depth probe/rod: used to measure depths of an object or a hole
   4. Main scale (Metric): scale marked every mm
   5. Main scale (Imperial): scale marked in inches and fractions
   6. Vernier scale (Metric) gives interpolated measurements to 0.1 mm or
      better
   7. Vernier scale (Imperial) gives interpolated measurements in fractions of
      an inch
   8. Retainer: used to block movable part to allow the easy transferring of a
      measurement
The calipers in the diagram show a primary reading on the metric scale of about
2.475 cm (2.4 cm read from the main scale plus about 0.075 cm from the Vernier
scale). Calipers often have a "zero point error", which is when the calipers do
not read 0.000 cm when the jaws are closed. The zero point error must always be
subtracted from the primary reading. Let us assume these calipers have a zero
point error of 0.013 cm. This would give us a length reading of 2.462 cm. For
any measurement, reporting the error on the measurement is also important. Both
the primary reading and the zero point reading are bounded by plus/minus half
the length corresponding to the width of the smallest interval on the Vernier
scale (0.0025 cm). These are "absolute" errors and absolute errors add, so the
length reading is then bounded by plus/minus the length corresponding to the
full width of the smallest interval on the Vernier scale (0.005 cm). Assuming
no systematics affect the measurement (the instrument works perfectly), a
complete measurement would then read 2.462 cm Â± 0.005 cm.
The vernier, dial, and digital calipers give a direct reading of the distance
measured with high accuracy_and_precision. They are functionally identical,
with different ways of reading the result. These calipers comprise a calibrated
scale with a fixed jaw, and another jaw, with a pointer, that slides along the
scale. The distance between the jaws is then read in different ways for the
three types.
The simplest method is to read the position of the pointer directly on the
scale. When the pointer is between two markings, the user can mentally
interpolate to improve the precision of the reading. This would be a simple
calibrated caliper; but the addition of a vernier_scale allows more accurate
interpolation, and is the universal practice; this is the vernier caliper.
Vernier, dial, and digital calipers can measure internal dimensions (using the
uppermost jaws in the picture at right), external dimensions using the pictured
lower jaws, and in many cases depth by the use of a probe that is attached to
the movable head and slides along the centre of the body. This probe is slender
and can get into deep grooves that may prove difficult for other measuring
tools.
The vernier scales may include metric measurements on the lower part of the
scale and inch measurements on the upper, or vice versa, in countries that use
inches. Vernier calipers commonly used in industry provide a precision to
0.01 mm (10 micrometres), or one thousandth of an inch. They are available in
sizes that can measure up to 1,829 mm (72 in).[8]
**** Dial caliper[edit] ****
Mitutoyo dial caliper
Instead of using a vernier mechanism, which requires some practice to use, the
dial caliper reads the final fraction of a millimeter or inch on a simple dial.
In this instrument, a small, precise rack_and_pinion drives a pointer on a
circular dial, allowing direct reading without the need to read a vernier
scale. Typically, the pointer rotates once every inch, tenth of an inch, or 1
millimeter. This measurement must be added to the coarse whole inches or
centimeters read from the slide. The dial is usually arranged to be rotatable
beneath the pointer, allowing for "differential" measurements (the measuring of
the difference in size between two objects, or the setting of the dial using a
master object and subsequently being able to read directly the plus-or-minus
variance in size of subsequent objects relative to the master object).
The slide of a dial caliper can usually be locked at a setting using a small
lever or screw; this allows simple go/no-go checks of part sizes.
**** Digital caliper[edit] ****
Digital caliper
A popular refinement replaces the analog dial with an electronic digital
display that displays the reading as a numeric value. Rather than a rack_and
pinion, these calipers use a linear_encoder. Some digital calipers can be
switched between centimeters or millimeters, and inches. All provide for
zeroing the display at any point along the slide, allowing the same sort of
differential measurements as with the dial caliper. Digital calipers may
contain a "reading hold" feature, allowing the reading of dimensions after use
in awkward locations where the display cannot be seen. Ordinary 6-in/150-mm
digital calipers are made of stainless steel, have a rated accuracy of 0.001 in
(0.02mm) and a resolution of 0.0005 in (0.01 mm).[9] The same technology is
used to make longer 8-in and 12-in calipers; the accuracy for longer
measurements declines to 0.001 in (0.03 mm) for 100â200 mm and 0.0015 in
(0.04 mm) for 200â300 mm.[10]
Increasingly, digital calipers offer a serial data output to allow them to be
interfaced with a dedicated recorder or a personal_computer. The digital
interface significantly decreases the time to make and record a series of
measurements, and it also improves the reliability of the records. A suitable
device to convert the serial data output to common computer interfaces such as
RS-232, Universal_Serial_Bus, or wireless can be built or purchased. With such
a converter, measurements can be directly entered into a spreadsheet, a
statistical_process_control program, or similar software.
The serial digital output varies among manufacturers. Common options are
    * Mitutoyo's Digimatic interface. This is the dominant name brand
      interface. Format is 52 bits arranged as 13 nibbles.[11][12][13]
    * Sylvac interface. This is the common protocol for inexpensive, non-name
      brand, calipers. Format is 24 bit 90 kHz synchronous.[14][15]
    * Starrett[16]
    * Brown & Sharpe[16]
    * Federal
    * Tesa[16]
    * Aldi. Format is 7 BCD digits.[15]
    * Mahr (Digimatic, RS232C, Wireless FM Radio, Infrared and USB)[17]
Like dial calipers, the slide of a digital caliper can usually be locked using
a lever or thumb-screw.
Some digital calipers contain a capacitive_linear_encoder. A pattern of bars is
etched directly on the printed_circuit_board in the slider. Under the scale of
the caliper another printed circuit board also contains an etched pattern of
lines. The combination of these printed circuit boards forms two variable
capacitors. The two capacitances are out of phase. As the slider moves the
capacitance changes in a linear fashion and in a repeating pattern. The
circuitry built into the slider counts the bars as the slider moves and does a
linear interpolation based on the magnitudes of the capacitors to find the
precise position of the slider. Other digital calipers contain an inductive
linear encoder, which allows robust performance in the presence of
contamination such as coolants.[18] Magnetic linear encoders are used in yet
other digital calipers.
**** Micrometer caliper[edit] ****
Main article: Micrometer
A caliper using a calibrated screw for measurement, rather than a slide, is
called an external micrometer caliper gauge, a micrometer caliper or, more
often, simply a micrometer. (Sometimes the term caliper, referring to any other
type in this article, is held in contradistinction to micrometer.)
***** Comparison[edit] *****
Each of the above types of calipers has its relative merits and faults.
Vernier calipers are rugged and have long lasting accuracy, are coolant proof,
are not affected by magnetic fields, and are largely shock proof. They may have
both centimeter and inch scales. However, vernier calipers require good
eyesight or a magnifying_glass to read and can be difficult to read from a
distance or from awkward angles. It is relatively easy to misread the last
digit. In production environments, reading vernier calipers all day long is
error-prone and is annoying to the workers.
Dial calipers are comparatively easy to read, especially when seeking exact
center by rocking and observing the needle movement. They can be set to 0 at
any point for comparisons. They are usually fairly susceptible to shock damage.
They are also very prone to getting dirt in the gears, which can cause accuracy
problems.
Digital calipers switch easily between centimeter and inch systems.They can be
set to 0 easily at any point with full count in either direction, and can take
measurements even if the display is completely hidden, either by using a "hold"
key, or by zeroing the display and closing the jaws, showing the correct
measurement, but negative. They can be mechanically and electronically fragile.
Most also require batteries, and do not resist coolant well. They are also only
moderately shockproof, and can be vulnerable to dirt.
Calipers may read to a resolution of 0.01 mm or 0.0005 in, but accuracy may not
be better than about Â±0.02 mm or 0.001 in for 150 mm (6 in) calipers, and
worse for longer ones.[19]
***** Use[edit] *****
Using the vernier caliper
A caliper must be properly applied against the part in order to take the
desired measurement. For example, when measuring the thickness of a plate a
vernier caliper must be held at right angles to the piece. Some practice may be
needed to measure round or irregular objects correctly.
Accuracy of measurement when using a caliper is highly dependent on the skill
of the operator. Regardless of type, a caliper's jaws must be forced into
contact with the part being measured. As both part and caliper are always to
some extent elastic, the amount of force used affects the indication. A
consistent, firm touch is correct. Too much force results in an underindication
as part and tool distort; too little force gives insufficient contact and an
overindication. This is a greater problem with a caliper incorporating a wheel,
which lends mechanical_advantage. This is especially the case with digital
calipers, calipers out of adjustment, or calipers with a poor quality beam.
Simple calipers are uncalibrated; the measurement taken must be compared
against a scale. Whether the scale is part of the caliper or not, all analog
calipersâverniers and dialsârequire good eyesight in order to achieve the
highest precision. Digital calipers have the advantage in this area.
Calibrated calipers may be mishandled, leading to loss of zero. When a
calipers' jaws are fully closed, it should, of course, indicate zero. If it
does not, it must be recalibrated or repaired. A vernier caliper does not
easily lose its calibration but a sharp impact or accidental damage to the
measuring surface in the caliper jaw can be significant enough to displace
zero.[20] Digital calipers have zero set buttons, for quick recalibration.
Vernier, dial and digital calipers can be used with accessories that extend
their usefulness. Examples are a base that extends their usefulness as a depth
gauge and a jaw attachment that allows measuring the center distance between
holes. Since the 1970s a clever modification of the moveable jaw on the back
side of any caliper allows for step or depth measurements in addition to
external caliper measurements, in similar fashion to a universal micrometer
(e.g., Starrett Mul-T-Anvil or Mitutoyo Uni-Mike).
***** Zero error[edit] *****
When the jaws are closed and if the reading is 0.10 mm, the zero error is
referred to as +0.10 mm. The method to use a vernier scale or caliper with zero
error is to use the formula "(actual reading) = (main scale) + (vernier scale)
â (zero error)", thus the actual reading is 19.00 + 0.54 â (0.10) = 19.44
mm. The resolution of the measurement, based on the width of the smallest sub-
interval, is Â±0.02 mm.
The method to use a vernier scale or caliper with zero error is to use the
formula "actual reading = main scale + vernier scale â (zero error)". Zero
error may arise due to knocks that affect the calibration at 0.00 mm when the
jaws are perfectly closed or just touching each other. Positive zero error
refers to the fact that when the jaws of the vernier caliper are just closed,
the reading is a positive reading away from the actual reading of 0.00 mm. If
the reading is 0.10 mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.10 mm. Negative
zero error refers to the fact that when the jaws of the vernier caliper are
just closed, the reading is a negative reading away from the actual reading of
0.00 mm. If the reading is â0.08 mm, the zero error is referred to as
â0.08 mm.
