Structure found in some plants; aka: blossom
A poster with flowers or clusters of flowers produced by twelve species of
flowering plants from different families.
Flowers in the Netherlands.
A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure
found in flowering_plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called
angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction,
usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may
facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in
a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower).
Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers
contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers
have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for
the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops
into fruit containing seeds.
In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have
long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and
also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.

***** Morphology *****
Main parts of a mature flower (Ranunculus_glaberrimus).
Diagram of flower parts.
**** Floral parts ****
The essential parts of a flower can be considered in two parts: the vegetative
part, consisting of petals and associated structures in the perianth, and the
reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower consists of four kinds of
structures attached to the tip of a short stalk. Each of these kinds of parts
is arranged in a whorl on the receptacle. The four main whorls (starting from
the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are as follows:
*** Perianth ***
Main articles: Perianth, Sepal, and Corolla_(flower)
Collectively the calyx and corolla form the perianth (see diagram).
    * Calyx: the outermost whorl consisting of units called sepals; these are
      typically green and enclose the rest of the flower in the bud stage,
      however, they can be absent or prominent and petal-like in some species.
    * Corolla: the next whorl toward the apex, composed of units called petals,
      which are typically thin, soft and colored to attract animals that help
      the process of pollination.
*** Reproductive ***
Main articles: Plant_reproductive_morphology, Androecium, and Gynoecium
Reproductive parts of Easter Lily (Lilium longiflorum). 1. Stigma, 2. Style,
3. Stamens, 4. Filament, 5. Petal
    * Androecium (from Greek andros oikia: man's house): the next whorl
      (sometimes multiplied into several whorls), consisting of units called
      stamens. Stamens consist of two parts: a stalk called a filament, topped
      by an anther where pollen is produced by meiosis and eventually
      dispersed.
    * Gynoecium (from Greek gynaikos oikia: woman's house): the innermost whorl
      of a flower, consisting of one or more units called carpels. The carpel
      or multiple fused carpels form a hollow structure called an ovary, which
      produces ovules internally. Ovules are megasporangia and they in turn
      produce megaspores by meiosis which develop into female gametophytes.
      These give rise to egg cells. The gynoecium of a flower is also described
      using an alternative terminology wherein the structure one sees in the
      innermost whorl (consisting of an ovary, style and stigma) is called a
      pistil. A pistil may consist of a single carpel or a number of carpels
      fused together. The sticky tip of the pistil, the stigma, is the receptor
      of pollen. The supportive stalk, the style, becomes the pathway for
      pollen_tubes to grow from pollen grains adhering to the stigma. The
      relationship to the gynoecium on the receptacle is described as
      hypogynous (beneath a superior ovary), perigynous (surrounding a superior
      ovary), or epigynous (above inferior ovary).
**** Structure ****
Although the arrangement described above is considered "typical", plant species
show a wide variation in floral structure.[1] These modifications have
significance in the evolution of flowering plants and are used extensively by
botanists to establish relationships among plant species.
The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the
receptacle and not by their function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may
be modified into other functions and/or look like what is typically another
part. In some families, like Ranunculaceae, the petals are greatly reduced and
in many species the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have
modified stamens that are petal-like; the double flowers of Peonies and Roses
are mostly petaloid stamens.[2] Flowers show great variation and plant
scientists describe this variation in a systematic way to identify and
distinguish species.
Specific terminology is used to describe flowers and their parts. Many flower
parts are fused together; fused parts originating from the same whorl are
connate, while fused parts originating from different whorls are adnate; parts
that are not fused are free. When petals are fused into a tube or ring that
falls away as a single unit, they are sympetalous (also called gamopetalous).
Connate petals may have distinctive regions: the cylindrical base is the tube,
the expanding region is the throat and the flaring outer region is the limb. A
sympetalous flower, with bilateral symmetry with an upper and lower lip, is
bilabiate. Flowers with connate petals or sepals may have various shaped
corolla or calyx, including campanulate, funnelform, tubular, urceolate,
salverform or rotate.
Referring to "fusion," as it is commonly done, appears questionable because at
least some of the processes involved may be non-fusion processes. For example,
the addition of intercalary growth at or below the base of the primordia of
floral appendages such as sepals, petals, stamens and carpels may lead to a
common base that is not the result of fusion.[3][4][5]
Left: A normal zygomorphic Streptocarpus flower. Right: An aberrant peloric
Streptocarpus flower. Both of these flowers appeared on the Streptocarpus
hybrid 'Anderson's Crows' Wings'.
Many flowers have a symmetry. When the perianth is bisected through the central
axis from any point and symmetrical halves are produced, the flower is said to
be actinomorphic or regular, e.g. rose or trillium. This is an example of
radial_symmetry. When flowers are bisected and produce only one line that
produces symmetrical halves, the flower is said to be irregular or zygomorphic,
e.g. snapdragon or most orchids.
Flowers may be directly attached to the plant at their base (sessileâthe
supporting stalk or stem is highly reduced or absent). The stem or stalk
subtending a flower is called a peduncle. If a peduncle supports more than one
flower, the stems connecting each flower to the main axis are called pedicels.
The apex of a flowering stem forms a terminal swelling which is called the
torus or receptacle.
*** Inflorescence ***
The familiar calla_lily is not a single flower. It is actually an inflorescence
of tiny flowers pressed together on a central stalk that is surrounded by a
large petal-like bract.
Main article: Inflorescence
In those species that have more than one flower on an axis, the collective
cluster of flowers is termed an inflorescence. Some inflorescences are composed
of many small flowers arranged in a formation that resembles a single flower.
The common example of this is most members of the very large composite
(Asteraceae) group. A single daisy or sunflower, for example, is not a flower
but a flower headâan inflorescence composed of numerous flowers (or florets).
An inflorescence may include specialized stems and modified leaves known as
bracts.
*** Floral diagrams and floral formulae ***
Main articles: Floral_formula and Floral_diagram
A floral formula is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific
letters, numbers and symbols, presenting substantial information about the
flower in a compact form. It can represent a taxon, usually giving ranges of
the numbers of different organs, or particular species. Floral formulae have
been developed in the early 19th century and their use has declined since.
Prenner et al. (2010) devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the
descriptive capability of the formula.[6] The format of floral formulae differs
in different parts of the world, yet they convey the same information.[7][8][9]
[10]
The structure of a flower can also be expressed by the means of floral
diagrams. The use of schematic diagrams can replace long descriptions or
complicated drawings as a tool for understanding both floral structure and
evolution. Such diagrams may show important features of flowers, including the
relative positions of the various organs, including the presence of fusion and
symmetry, as well as structural details.[7]
***** Development *****
A flower develops on a modified shoot or axis from a determinate apical
meristem (determinate meaning the axis grows to a set size). It has compressed
internodes, bearing structures that in classical plant morphology are
interpreted as highly modified leaves.[11] Detailed developmental studies,
however, have shown that stamens are often initiated more or less like modified
stems (caulomes) that in some cases may even resemble branchlets.[5][1] Taking
into account the whole diversity in the development of the androecium of
flowering plants, we find a continuum between modified leaves (phyllomes),
modified stems (caulomes), and modified branchlets (shoots).[12][13]
**** Flowering transition ****
The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant
makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is
favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal
reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret
important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant
hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[14] Many perennial
and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular
interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal
known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including Constans,
Flowering Locus C and Flowering Locus T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in
reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce
a number of different physiological and morphological changes.[15]
The first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem
primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place
to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue
that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the
stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled
or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances
develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process
begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers,
even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some
environmental cue.[16] Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the
stem will continue to develop a flower.
Yvonne_Aitken has shown that flowering transition depends on a number of
factors, and that plants flowering earliest under given conditions had the
least dependence on climate whereas later-flowering varieties reacted strongly
to the climate setup.
**** Organ development ****
Main article: ABC_model_of_flower_development
The ABC model of flower development
The molecular control of floral organ identity determination appears to be
fairly well understood in some species. In a simple model, three gene
activities interact in a combinatorial manner to determine the developmental
identities of the organ primordia within the floral meristem. These gene
functions are called A, B and C-gene functions. In the first floral whorl only
A-genes are expressed, leading to the formation of sepals. In the second whorl
both A- and B-genes are expressed, leading to the formation of petals. In the
third whorl, B and C genes interact to form stamens and in the center of the
flower C-genes alone give rise to carpels. The model is based upon studies of
mutants in Arabidopsis_thaliana and snapdragon, Antirrhinum_majus. For example,
when there is a loss of B-gene function, mutant flowers are produced with
sepals in the first whorl as usual, but also in the second whorl instead of the
normal petal formation. In the third whorl the lack of B function but presence
of C-function mimics the fourth whorl, leading to the formation of carpels also
in the third whorl.
Most genes central in this model belong to the MADS-box genes and are
transcription_factors that regulate the expression of the genes specific for
each floral organ.
***** Floral function *****
See also: Plant_reproductive_morphology
A "perfect flower", this Crateva_religiosa flower has both stamens (outer ring)
and a pistil (center).
The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction of the individual and the
species. All flowering plants are heterosporous, producing two types of spores.
Microspores are produced by meiosis inside anthers while megaspores are
produced inside ovules, inside an ovary. In fact, anthers typically consist of
four microsporangia and an ovule is an integumented megasporangium. Both types
of spores develop into gametophytes inside sporangia. As with all heterosporous
plants, the gametophytes also develop inside the spores (are endosporic).
In the majority of species, individual flowers have both functional carpels and
stamens. Botanists describe these flowers as being perfect or bisexual and the
species as hermaphroditic. Some flowers lack one or the other reproductive
organ and called imperfect or unisexual. If unisex flowers are found on the
same individual plant but in different locations, the species is said to be
monoecious. If each type of unisex flower is found only on separate
individuals, the plant is dioecious.
**** Flower specialization and pollination ****
Further information: Pollination_syndrome
Flowering plants usually face selective pressure to optimize the transfer of
their pollen, and this is typically reflected in the morphology of the flowers
and the behaviour of the plants. Pollen may be transferred between plants via a
number of 'vectors'. Some plants make use of abiotic vectors â namely wind
(anemophily) or, much less commonly, water (hydrophily). Others use biotic
vectors including insects (entomophily), birds (ornithophily), bats
(chiropterophily) or other animals. Some plants make use of multiple vectors,
but many are highly specialised.
Cleistogamous_flowers are self-pollinated, after which they may or may not
open. Many Viola and some Salvia species are known to have these types of
flowers.
The flowers of plants that make use of biotic pollen vectors commonly have
glands called nectaries that act as an incentive for animals to visit the
flower. Some flowers have patterns, called nectar_guides, that show pollinators
where to look for nectar. Flowers also attract pollinators by scent and color.
Still other flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators. Some species of
orchids, for example, produce flowers resembling female bees in color, shape,
and scent. Flowers are also specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the
stamens that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the
pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as nectar, pollen,
or a mate). In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of the same species,
the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmasâarranged with equally pointed
precisionâof all of the flowers it visits.
Anemophilous_flowers use the wind to move pollen from one flower to the next.
Examples include grasses, birch trees, ragweed and maples. They have no need to
attract pollinators and therefore tend not to be "showy" flowers. Male and
female reproductive organs are generally found in separate flowers, the male
flowers having a number of long filaments terminating in exposed stamens, and
the female flowers having long, feather-like stigmas. Whereas the pollen of
animal-pollinated flowers tends to be large-grained, sticky, and rich in
protein (another "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is
usually small-grained, very light, and of little nutritional value to animals.
***** Pollination *****
Main article: Pollination
Grains of pollen sticking to this bee will be transferred to the next flower it
visits
The primary purpose of a flower is reproduction. Since the flowers are the
reproductive organs of plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained
within pollen, to the ovules â contained in the ovary. Pollination is the
movement of pollen from the anthers to the stigma. The joining of the sperm to
the ovules is called fertilization. Normally pollen is moved from one plant to
another, but many plants are able to self pollinate. The fertilized ovules
produce seeds that are the next generation. Sexual reproduction produces
genetically unique offspring, allowing for adaptation. Flowers have specific
designs which encourages the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of
the same species. Many plants are dependent upon external factors for
pollination, including: wind and animals, and especially insects. Even large
animals such as birds, bats, and pygmy_possums can be employed. The period of
time during which this process can take place (the flower is fully expanded and
functional) is called anthesis. The study of pollination by insects is called
anthecology.
**** Pollination mechanism ****
The pollination mechanism employed by a plant depends on what method of
pollination is utilized.
Most flowers can be divided between two broad groups of pollination methods:
Entomophilous: flowers attract and use insects, bats, birds or other animals to
transfer pollen from one flower to the next. Often they are specialized in
shape and have an arrangement of the stamens that ensures that pollen grains
are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its
attractant (such as nectar, pollen, or a mate). In pursuing this attractant
from many flowers of the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the
stigmasâarranged with equally pointed precisionâof all of the flowers it
visits. Many flowers rely on simple proximity between flower parts to ensure
pollination. Others, such as the Sarracenia or lady-slipper_orchids, have
elaborate designs to ensure pollination while preventing self-pollination.
Grass flower with vestigial perianth or lodicules
Anemophilous: flowers use the wind to move pollen from one flower to the next,
examples include the grasses, Birch trees, Ragweed and Maples. They have no
need to attract pollinators and therefore tend not to grow large blossoms.
Whereas the pollen of entomophilous flowers tends to be large-grained, sticky,
and rich in protein (another "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous flower
pollen is usually small-grained, very light, and of little nutritional value to
insects, though it may still be gathered in times of dearth. Honeybees and
bumblebees actively gather anemophilous corn (maize) pollen, though it is of
little value to them.
Some flowers with both stamens and a pistil are capable of self-fertilization,
which does increase the chance of producing seeds but limits genetic variation.
The extreme case of self-fertilization occurs in flowers that always self-
fertilize, such as many dandelions. Some flowers are self-pollinated and use
flowers that never open or are self-pollinated before the flowers open, these
flowers are called cleistogamous. Many Viola species and some Salvia have these
types of flowers. Conversely, many species of plants have ways of preventing
self-fertilization. Unisexual male and female flowers on the same plant may not
appear or mature at the same time, or pollen from the same plant may be
incapable of fertilizing its ovules. The latter flower types, which have
chemical barriers to their own pollen, are referred to as self-sterile or self-
incompatible.
**** Attraction methods ****
A Bee_orchid has evolved over many generations to better mimic a female bee to
attract male bees as pollinators.
Plants cannot move from one location to another, thus many flowers have evolved
to attract animals to transfer pollen between individuals in dispersed
populations. Flowers that are insect-pollinated are called entomophilous;
literally "insect-loving" in Greek. They can be highly modified along with the
pollinating insects by co-evolution. Flowers commonly have glands called
nectaries on various parts that attract animals looking for nutritious nectar.
Birds and bees have color vision, enabling them to seek out "colorful" flowers.
Some flowers have patterns, called nectar_guides, that show pollinators where
to look for nectar; they may be visible only under ultraviolet light, which is
visible to bees and some other insects. Flowers also attract pollinators by
scent and some of those scents are pleasant to our sense of smell. Not all
flower scents are appealing to humans; a number of flowers are pollinated by
insects that are attracted to rotten flesh and have flowers that smell like
dead animals, often called Carrion_flowers, including Rafflesia, the titan
arum, and the North American pawpaw (Asimina triloba). Flowers pollinated by
night visitors, including bats and moths, are likely to concentrate on scent to
attract pollinators and most such flowers are white.
Other flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators. Some species of orchids, for
example, produce flowers resembling female bees in color, shape, and scent.
Male bees move from one such flower to another in search of a mate.
**** Flower-pollinator relationships ****
Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific pollinating
organisms. Many flowers, for example, attract only one specific species of
insect, and therefore rely on that insect for successful reproduction. This
close relationship is often given as an example of coevolution, as the flower
and pollinator are thought to have developed together over a long period of
time to match each other's needs.
This close relationship compounds the negative effects of extinction. The
extinction of either member in such a relationship would mean almost certain
extinction of the other member as well. Some endangered_plant_species are so
because of shrinking_pollinator_populations.
**** Pollen allergy ****
There is much confusion about the role of flowers in allergies. For example,
the showy and entomophilous goldenrod (Solidago) is frequently blamed for
respiratory_allergies, of which it is innocent, since its pollen cannot be
airborne. The types of pollen that most commonly cause allergic reactions are
produced by the plain-looking plants (trees, grasses, and weeds) that do not
have showy flowers. These plants make small, light, dry pollen grains that are
custom-made for wind transport.
The type of allergens in the pollen is the main factor that determines whether
the pollen is likely to cause hay fever. For example, pine tree pollen is
produced in large amounts by a common tree, which would make it a good
candidate for causing allergy. It is, however, a relatively rare cause of
allergy because the types of allergens in pine pollen appear to make it less
allergenic. Instead the allergen is usually the pollen of the contemporary
bloom of anemophilous ragweed (Ambrosia), which can drift for many miles.
Scientists have collected samples of ragweed pollen 400 miles out at sea and 2
miles high in the air.[17] A single ragweed plant can generate a million grains
of pollen per day.[18]
Among North American plants, weeds are the most prolific producers of
allergenic pollen.[19] Ragweed is the major culprit, but other important
sources are sagebrush, redroot pigweed, lamb's quarters, Russian thistle
(tumbleweed), and English plantain.
It is common to hear people say they are allergic to colorful or scented
flowers like roses. In fact, only florists, gardeners, and others who have
prolonged, close contact with flowers are likely to be sensitive to pollen from
these plants. Most people have little contact with the large, heavy, waxy
pollen grains of such flowering plants because this type of pollen is not
carried by wind but by insects such as butterflies and bees.

While land plants have existed for about 425 million years, the first ones
reproduced by a simple adaptation of their aquatic counterparts: spores. In the
sea, plantsâand some animalsâcan simply scatter out genetic clones of
themselves to float away and grow elsewhere. This is how early plants
reproduced. But plants soon evolved methods of protecting these copies to deal
with drying out and other damage which is even more likely on land than in the
sea. The protection became the seed, though it had not yet evolved the flower.
Early seed-bearing plants include the ginkgo and conifers.
Archaefructus_liaoningensis, one of the earliest known flowering plants
Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, particularly seed_ferns, have been
proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants but there is no continuous fossil
evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. The apparently sudden appearance
of relatively modern flowers in the fossil record posed such a problem for the
theory of evolution that it was called an "abominable mystery" by Charles
Darwin.
Recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus, along with
further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm
characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. An early fossil of
a flowering plant, Archaefructus_liaoningensis from China, is dated about 125
million years old.[20][21] Even earlier from China is the 125â130 million
years old Archaefructus_sinensis. In 2015 a plant (130 million-year-old
Montsechia_vidalii, discovered in Spain) was claimed to be 130 million years
old.[22] In 2018, scientists reported that the earliest flowers began about 180
million years ago.[23]
Amborella_trichopoda may have characteristic features of the earliest flowering
plants
Recent DNA analysis (molecular_systematics)[24] shows that Amborella
trichopoda, found on the Pacific island of New Caledonia, is the only species
in the sister_group to the rest of the flowering plants, and morphological
studies suggest that it has features which may have been characteristic of the
earliest flowering plants.[25]
Besides the hard proof of flowers in or shortly before the Cretaceous,[26][27]
there is some circumstantial evidence of flowers as much as 250 million years
ago. A chemical used by plants to defend their flowers, oleanane, has been
detected in fossil plants that old, including gigantopterids,[28] which evolved
at that time and bear many of the traits of modern, flowering plants, though
they are not known to be flowering plants themselves, because only their stems
and prickles have been found preserved in detail; one of the earliest examples
of petrification.
The similarity in leaf and stem structure can be very important, because
flowers are genetically just an adaptation of normal leaf and stem components
on plants, a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots.
[29] The most primitive flowers are thought to have had a variable number of
flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other. The flowers
would have tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be bisexual (in plants, this
means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to be dominated by
the ovary (female part). As flowers grew more advanced, some variations
developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design,
and with either specific sexes per flower or plant, or at least "ovary
inferior".
The general assumption is that the function of flowers, from the start, was to
involve animals in the reproduction process. Pollen can be scattered without
bright colors and obvious shapes, which would therefore be a liability, using
the plant's resources, unless they provide some other benefit. One proposed
reason for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowers is that they
evolved in an isolated setting like an island, or chain of islands, where the
plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with
some specific animal (a wasp, for example), the way many island species develop
today. This symbiotic relationship, with a hypothetical wasp bearing pollen
from one plant to another much the way fig_wasps do today, could have
eventually resulted in both the plant(s) and their partners developing a high
degree of specialization. Island_genetics is believed to be a common source of
speciation, especially when it comes to radical adaptations which seem to have
required inferior transitional forms. Note that the wasp example is not
incidental; bees, apparently evolved specifically for symbiotic plant
relationships, are descended from wasps.
Likewise, most fruit used in plant reproduction comes from the enlargement of
parts of the flower. This fruit is frequently a tool which depends upon animals
wishing to eat it, and thus scattering the seeds it contains.
While many such symbiotic_relationships remain too fragile to survive
competition with mainland organisms, flowers proved to be an unusually
effective means of production, spreading (whatever their actual origin) to
become the dominant form of land plant life.
Flower evolution continues to the present day; modern flowers have been so
profoundly influenced by humans that many of them cannot be pollinated in
nature. Many modern, domesticated flowers used to be simple weeds, which only
sprouted when the ground was disturbed. Some of them tended to grow with human
crops, and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty,
developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection.[30]
***** Color *****
See also: Color_garden
Reflectance spectra for the flowers of several varieties of rose. A red rose
absorbs about 99.7% of light across a broad area below the red wavelengths of
the spectrum, leading to an exceptionally pure red. A yellow rose will reflect
about 5% of blue light, producing an unsaturated yellow (a yellow with a degree
of white in it).
Many flowering plants reflect as much light as possible within the range of
visible wavelengths of the pollinator the plant intends to attract. Flowers
that reflect the full range of visible light are generally perceived as white
by a human observer. An important feature of white flowers is that they reflect
equally across the visible spectrum. While many flowering plants use white to
attract pollinators, the use of color is also widespread (even within the same
species). Color allows a flowering plant to be more specific about the
pollinator it seeks to attract. The color model used by human color
reproduction technology (CMYK) relies on the modulation of pigments that divide
the spectrum into broad areas of absorption. Flowering plants by contrast are
able to shift the transition point wavelength between absorption and
reflection. If it is assumed that the visual systems of most pollinators view
the visible spectrum as circular then it may be said that flowering plants
produce color by absorbing the light in one region of the spectrum and
reflecting the light in the other region. With CMYK, color is produced as a
function of the amplitude of the broad regions of absorption. Flowering plants
by contrast produce color by modifying the frequency (or rather wavelength) of
the light reflected. Most flowers absorb light in the blue to yellow region of
the spectrum and reflect light from the green to red region of the spectrum.
For many species of flowering plant, it is the transition point that
characterizes the color that they produce. Color may be modulated by shifting
the transition point between absorption and reflection and in this way a
flowering plant may specify which pollinator it seeks to attract. Some
flowering plants also have a limited ability to modulate areas of absorption.
This is typically not as precise as control over wavelength. Humans observers
will perceive this as degrees of saturation (the amount of white in the color).
***** Symbolism *****
Lilies are often used to denote life or resurrection
Main article: Language_of_flowers
Many flowers have important symbolic meanings in Western culture.[31] The
practice of assigning meanings to flowers is known as floriography. Some of the
more common examples include:
    * Red roses are given as a symbol of love, beauty, and passion.[32]
    * Poppies are a symbol of consolation in time of death. In the United
      Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, red poppies are worn to
      commemorate soldiers who have died in times of war.
    * Irises/Lily are used in burials as a symbol referring to "resurrection/
      life". It is also associated with stars (sun) and its petals blooming/
      shining.
    * Daisies are a symbol of innocence.
Flowers are common subjects of still_life paintings, such as this one by
Ambrosius_Bosschaert_the_Elder
Because of their varied and colorful appearance, flowers have long been a
favorite subject of visual artists as well. Some of the most celebrated
paintings from well-known painters are of flowers, such as Van_Gogh's
sunflowers series or Monet's water lilies. Flowers are also dried, freeze dried
and pressed in order to create permanent, three-dimensional pieces of flower
art.
Flowers within art are also representative of the female_genitalia,[33] as seen
in the works of artists such as Georgia_O'Keeffe, Imogen_Cunningham, Veronica
Ruiz_de_Velasco, and Judy_Chicago, and in fact in Asian and western classical
art. Many cultures around the world have a marked tendency to associate flowers
with femininity.
The great variety of delicate and beautiful flowers has inspired the works of
numerous poets, especially from the 18thâ19th century Romantic era. Famous
examples include William_Wordsworth's I_Wandered_Lonely_as_a_Cloud and William
Blake's Ah!_Sun-Flower.
Their symbolism in dreams has also been discussed, with possible
interpretations including "blossoming potential".[34]
The Roman goddess of flowers, gardens, and the season of Spring is Flora. The
Greek goddess of spring, flowers and nature is Chloris.
In Hindu mythology, flowers have a significant status. Vishnu, one of the three
major gods in the Hindu system, is often depicted standing straight on a lotus
flower.[35] Apart from the association with Vishnu, the Hindu tradition also
considers the lotus to have spiritual significance.[36] For example, it figures
in the Hindu stories of creation.[37]

Flower market â Detroit's Eastern_Market
In modern times, people have sought ways to cultivate, buy, wear, or otherwise
be around flowers and blooming plants, partly because of their agreeable
appearance and smell. Around the world, people use flowers to mark important
events in their lives:
    * For new births or christenings
    * As a corsage or boutonniere worn at social functions or for holidays
    * As tokens of love or esteem
    * For wedding flowers for the bridal party, and for decorations for the
      hall
    * As brightening decorations within the home
    * As a gift of remembrance for bon voyage parties, welcome-home parties,
      and "thinking of you" gifts
    * For funeral flowers and expressions of sympathy for the grieving
    * For worship. In Hindu culture adherents commonly bring flowers as a gift
      to temples[38]

People therefore grow flowers around their homes, dedicate parts of their
living space to flower_gardens, pick wildflowers, or buy commercially-grown
flowers from florists.
Flowers provide less food than other major plant parts (seeds, fruits, roots,
stems and leaves), but still provide several important vegetables and spices.
Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most
expensive spice, saffron, consists of dried stigmas of a crocus. Other flower
spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Marigold
flowers are fed to chickens to give their egg yolks a golden yellow color,
which consumers find more desirable; dried and ground marigold flowers are also
used as a spice and colouring agent in Georgian_cuisine. Flowers of the
dandelion and elder are often made into wine. Bee pollen, pollen collected from
bees, is considered a health food by some people. Honey consists of bee-
processed flower nectar and is often named for the type of flower, e.g. orange
blossom honey, clover honey and tupelo honey.
Hundreds_of_fresh_flowers_are_edible, but only few are widely marketed as food.
They are often added to salads as garnishes. Squash_blossoms are dipped in
breadcrumbs and fried. Some edible_flowers include nasturtium, chrysanthemum,
carnation, cattail, Japanese_honeysuckle, chicory, cornflower, canna, and
sunflower.[39] Edible flowers such as daisy, rose, and violet are sometimes
candied.[40]
Flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, jasmine, Japanese honeysuckle, and
chamomile, chosen for their fragrance and medicinal properties, are used as
tisanes, either mixed with tea or on their own.[41]
Flowers have been used since prehistoric times in funeral rituals: traces of
pollen have been found on a woman's tomb in the El_Miron_Cave in Spain.[42]
Many cultures draw a connection between flowers and life and death, and because
of their seasonal return flowers also suggest rebirth, which may explain why
many people place flowers upon graves. The ancient_Greeks, as recorded in
Euripides's play The_Phoenician_Women, placed a crown of flowers on the head of
the deceased;[43] they also covered tombs with wreaths and flower petals.
Flowers were widely used in ancient_Egyptian burials,[44] and the Mexicans to
this day use flowers prominently in their Day_of_the_Dead celebrations[45] in
the same way that their Aztec ancestors did.

**** Flower-giving ****
The flower-giving tradition goes back to prehistoric times when flowers often
had a medicinal and herbal attributes. Archaeologists found in several grave
sites remnants of flower petals. Flowers were first used as sacrificial and
burial objects. Ancient_Egyptians and later Greeks and Romans used flowers. In
Egypt, burial objects from the time around 1540 BC[citation_needed] were found,
which depicted red_poppy, yellow Araun, cornflower and lilies. Records of
flower giving appear in Chinese_writings and Egyptian hieroglyphics, as well as
in Greek and Roman_mythology. The practice of giving a flower flourished in the
Middle Ages when couples showed affection through flowers.
The tradition of flower-giving exists in many forms. It is an important part of
Russian_culture and folklore. It is common for students to give flowers to
their teachers. To give yellow flowers in a romantic relationship means break-
up in Russia. Nowadays, flowers are often given away in the form of a flower
bouquet.[46][47][48][49]
