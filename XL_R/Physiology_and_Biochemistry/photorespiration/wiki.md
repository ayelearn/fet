Simplified C2 cycle
Simplified photorespiration and Calvin cycle
Photorespiration (also known as the oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle, or
C2 photosynthesis) refers to a process in plant_metabolism where the enzyme
RuBisCO oxygenates RuBP, wasting some of the energy produced by photosynthesis.
The desired reaction is the addition of carbon_dioxide to RuBP (carboxylation),
a key step in the CalvinâBenson_cycle, however approximately 25% of reactions
by RuBisCO instead add oxygen to RuBP (oxygenation), creating a product that
cannot be used within the CalvinâBenson cycle. This process reduces the
efficiency of photosynthesis, potentially reducing photosynthetic output by 25%
in C3_plants.[1] Photorespiration involves a complex network of enzyme
reactions that exchange metabolites between chloroplasts, leaf peroxisomes and
mitochondria.
The oxygenation reaction of RuBisCO is a wasteful process because 3-
phosphoglycerate (G3P) is created at a reduced rate and higher metabolic cost
compared with RuBP_carboxylase_activity. While photorespiratory carbon cycling
results in the formation of G3P eventually, around 25% of carbon fixed by
photorespiration is re-released as CO
2[2] and nitrogen, as ammonia. Ammonia must then be detoxified at a substantial
cost to the cell. Photorespiration also incurs a direct cost of one ATP and one
NAD(P)H.
While it is common to refer to the entire process as photorespiration,
technically the term refers only to the metabolic network which acts to rescue
the products of the oxygenation reaction (phosphoglycolate).

Photorespiration
Photorespiration
Addition of molecular oxygen to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate produces 3-
phosphoglycerate (PGA) and 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG, or PG). PGA is the normal
product of carboxylation, and productively enters the Calvin_cycle.
Phosphoglycolate, however, inhibits certain enzymes involved in photosynthetic
carbon fixation (hence is often said to be an 'inhibitor of photosynthesis').
[3] It is also relatively difficult to recycle: in higher plants it is salvaged
by a series of reactions in the peroxisome, mitochondria, and again in the
peroxisome where it is converted into glycerate. Glycerate reenters the
chloroplast and by the same transporter that exports glycolate. A cost of 1 ATP
is associated with conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) (Phosphorylation),
within the chloroplast, which is then free to re-enter the Calvin cycle.
Several costs are associated with this metabolic pathway; the production of
hydrogen_peroxide in the peroxisome (associated with the conversion of
glycolate to glyoxylate). Hydrogen peroxide is a dangerously strong oxidant
which must be immediately split into water and oxygen by the enzyme catalase.
The conversion of 2Ã 2Carbon glycine to 1 C3 serine in the mitochondria by the
enzyme glycine-decarboxylase is a key step, which releases CO
2, NH3, and reduces NAD to NADH. Thus, 1 CO
2 molecule is produced for every 2 molecules of O
2 (two deriving from RuBisCO and one from peroxisomal oxidations). The
assimilation of NH3 occurs via the GS-GOGAT cycle, at a cost of one ATP and one
NADPH.
Cyanobacteria have three possible pathways through which they can metabolise 2-
phosphoglycolate. They are unable to grow if all three pathways are knocked
out, despite having a carbon concentrating mechanism that should dramatically
reduce the rate of photorespiration (see_below).[4]
***** Substrate specificity of RuBisCO[edit] *****
The oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle reaction is catalyzed by RuBP
oxygenase activity:
      RuBP + O
      2 → Phosphoglycolate + 3-phosphoglycerate + 2H+
Oxygenase activity of RuBisCO
During the catalysis by RuBisCO, an 'activated' intermediate is formed (an
enediol intermediate) in the RuBisCO active site. This intermediate is able to
react with either CO
2 or O
2. It has been demonstrated that the specific shape of the RuBisCO active site
acts to encourage reactions with CO
2. Although there is a significant "failure" rate (~25% of reactions are
oxygenation rather than carboxylation), this represents significant favouring
of CO
2, when the relative abundance of the two gases is taken into account: in the
current atmosphere, O
2 is approximately 500 times more abundant, and in solution O
2 is 25 times more abundant than CO
2.[5]
The ability of RuBisCO to specify between the two gases is known as its
selectivity factor (or Srel), and it varies between species,[5] with
angiosperms more efficient than other plants, but with little variation among
the vascular_plants.[6]
A suggested explanation into RuBisCO's inability to discriminate completely
between CO
2 and O
2 is that it is an evolutionary relic:[citation_needed] The early atmosphere in
which primitive plants originated contained very little oxygen, the early
evolution of RuBisCO was not influenced by its ability to discriminate between
O
2 and CO
2.[6]
***** Conditions which affect photorespiration[edit] *****
Photorespiration rates are increased by:
**** Altered substrate availability: lowered CO2 or increased O2[edit] ****
Factors which influence this include the atmospheric abundance of the two
gases, the supply of the gases to the site of fixation (i.e. in land plants:
whether the stomata are open or closed), the length of the liquid phase (how
far these gases have to diffuse through water in order to reach the reaction
site). For example, when the stomata are closed to prevent water loss during
drought: this limits the CO
2 supply, while O
2 production within the leaf will continue. In algae (and plants which
photosynthesise underwater); gases have to diffuse significant distances
through water, which results in a decrease in the availability of CO
2 relative to O
2. It has been predicted that the increase in ambient CO
2 concentrations predicted over the next 100 years may reduce the rate of
photorespiration in most_plants by around 50%[citation_needed].
**** Increased temperature[edit] ****
At higher temperatures RuBisCO is less able to discriminate between CO
2 and O
2. This is because the enediol intermediate is less stable. Increasing
temperatures also reduce the solubility of CO
2, thus reducing the concentration of CO
2 relative to O
2 in the chloroplast.
***** Biological adaptation to minimize photorespiration[edit] *****
Certain species of plants or algae have mechanisms to reduce uptake of
molecular oxygen by RuBisCO. These are commonly referred to as Carbon
Concentrating_Mechanisms (CCMs), as they increase the concentration of
CO
2
 so that RuBisCO is less likely to produce glycolate through reaction with O
2.
**** Biochemical carbon concentrating mechanisms[edit] ****
Biochemical CCMs concentrate carbon dioxide in one temporal or spatial region,
through metabolite exchange. C4 and CAM photosynthesis both use the enzyme
Phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxylase (PEPC) to add CO
2 to a 3-Carbon sugar. PEPC is faster than RuBisCO, and more selective for CO
2.
*** C4[edit] ***
Maize uses the C4 pathway, minimizing photorespiration.
C4 plants capture carbon dioxide in their mesophyll cells (using an enzyme
called phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxylase which catalyzes the combination of
carbon dioxide with a compound called phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)), forming
oxaloacetate. This oxaloacetate is then converted to malate and is transported
into the bundle sheath cells (site of carbon dioxide fixation by RuBisCO) where
oxygen concentration is low to avoid photorespiration. Here, carbon dioxide is
removed from the malate and combined with RuBP by RuBisCO in the usual way, and
the Calvin_Cycle proceeds as normal. The CO
2 concentrations in the Bundle Sheath are approximately 10â20 fold higher
than the concentration in the mesophyll cells.[6]
This ability to avoid photorespiration makes these plants more hardy than other
plants in dry and hot environments, wherein stomata are closed and internal
carbon dioxide levels are low. Under these conditions, photorespiration does
occur in C4 plants, but at a much reduced level compared with C3 plants in the
same conditions. C4 plants include sugar_cane, corn_(maize), and sorghum.
*** CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism)[edit] ***
Overnight graph of CO2 absorbed by a CAM plant
CAM plants, such as cacti and succulent_plants, also use the enzyme PEP
carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide, but only at night. Crassulacean_acid
metabolism allows plants to conduct most of their gas exchange in the cooler
night-time air, sequestering carbon in 4-carbon sugars which can be released to
the photosynthesizing cells during the day. This allows CAM plants to reduce
water loss (transpiration) by maintaining closed stomata during the day. CAM
plants usually display other water-saving characteristics, such as thick
cuticles, stomata with small apertures, and typically lose around 1/3 of the
amount of water per CO
2 fixed.[7]
*** Algae[edit] ***
There have been some reports of algae operating a biochemical CCM: shuttling
metabolites within single cells to concentrate CO
2 in one area. This process is not fully understood.[8]
**** Biophysical carbon-concentrating mechanisms[edit] ****
This type of carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) relies on a contained
compartment within the cell into which CO
2 is shuttled, and where RuBisCO is highly expressed. In many species,
biophysical CCMs are only induced under low carbon dioxide concentrations.
Biophysical CCMs are more evolutionarily ancient than biochemical CCMs. There
is some debate as to when biophysical CCMs first evolved, but it is likely to
have been during a period of low carbon dioxide, after the Great_Oxygenation
Event (2.4 billion years ago). Low CO
2 periods occurred around 750, 650, and 320â270 million years ago.[9]
*** Eukaryotic algae[edit] ***
In nearly all species of eukaryotic_algae (Chloromonas being one notable
exception), upon induction of the CCM, ~95% of RuBisCO is densely packed into a
single subcellular compartment: the pyrenoid. Carbon dioxide is concentrated in
this compartment using a combination of CO
2 pumps, bicarbonate pumps, and carbonic_anhydrases. The pyrenoid is not a
membrane bound compartment, but is found within the chloroplast, often
surrounded by a starch sheath (which is not thought to serve a function in the
CCM).[10]
*** Hornworts[edit] ***
Certain species of hornwort are the only land plants which are known to have a
biophysical CCM involving concentration of carbon dioxide within pyrenoids in
their chloroplasts.
*** Cyanobacteria[edit] ***
Cyanobacterial CCMs are similar in principle to those found in eukaryotic algae
and hornworts, but the compartment into which carbon dioxide is concentrated
has several structural differences. Instead of the pyrenoid, cyanobacteria
contain carboxysomes, which have a protein shell, and linker proteins packing
RuBisCO inside with a very regular structure. Cyanobacterial CCMs are much
better understood than those found in eukaryotes, partly due to the ease of
genetic manipulation of prokaryotes.
***** Possible purpose of photorespiration[edit] *****
Reducing photorespiration may not result in increased growth rates for plants.
Photorespiration may be necessary for the assimilation of nitrate from soil.
Thus, a reduction in photorespiration by genetic engineering or because of
increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (due to fossil fuel burning) may not
benefit plants as has been proposed.[11] Several physiological processes may be
responsible for linking photorespiration and nitrogen assimilation.
Photorespiration increases availability of NADH, which is required for the
conversion of nitrate to nitrite. Certain nitrite transporters also transport
bicarbonate, and elevated CO2 has been shown to suppress nitrite transport into
chloroplasts.[12] However, in an agricultural setting, replacing the native
photorespiration pathway with an engineered synthetic pathway to metabolize
glycolate in the chloroplast resulted in a 40 percent increase in crop growth.
[13][14][15]
Although photorespiration is greatly reduced in C4 species, it is still an
essential pathway – mutants without functioning 2-phosphoglycolate metabolism
cannot grow in normal conditions. One mutant was shown to rapidly accumulate
glycolate.[16]
Although the functions of photorespiration remain controversial,[17] it is
widely accepted that this pathway influences a wide range of processes from
bioenergetics, photosystem II function, and carbon metabolism to nitrogen
assimilation and respiration. The oxygenase reaction of RuBisCO may prevent CO2
depletion near its active sites[18] and contributes to the regulation of CO2.
concentration in the atmosphere[19] The photorespiratory pathway is a major
source of hydrogen_peroxide (H
2O
2) in photosynthetic cells. Through H
2O
2 production and pyrimidine nucleotide interactions, photorespiration makes a
key contribution to cellular redox homeostasis. In so doing, it influences
multiple signalling pathways, in particular, those that govern plant hormonal
responses controlling growth, environmental and defense responses, and
programmed cell death.[17]
It has been postulated that photorespiration may function as a "safety valve",
[20] preventing the excess of reductive potential coming from an overreduced
NADPH-pool from reacting with oxygen and producing free_radicals, as these can
damage the metabolic functions of the cell by subsequent oxidation of membrane
lipids, proteins or nucleotides. The mutants deficient in photorespiratory
enzymes are characterized by a high redox level in the cell,[21] impaired
stomatal regulation,[22] and accumulation of formate.[23]
