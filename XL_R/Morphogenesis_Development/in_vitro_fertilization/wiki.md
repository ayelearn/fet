In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process of fertilisation where an egg is
combined with sperm outside the body, in_vitro ("in glass"). The process
involves monitoring and stimulating a woman's ovulatory process, removing an
ovum or ova (egg or eggs) from the woman's ovaries and letting sperm fertilise
them in a liquid in a laboratory. After the fertilised egg (zygote) undergoes
embryo_culture for 2â6 days, it is implanted in the same or another woman's
uterus, with the intention of establishing a successful pregnancy.
IVF is a type of assisted_reproductive_technology used for infertility
treatment and gestational_surrogacy. A fertilised egg may be implanted into a
surrogate's uterus, and the resulting child is genetically unrelated to the
surrogate. Some countries banned or otherwise regulate the availability of IVF
treatment, giving rise to fertility_tourism. Restrictions on the availability
of IVF include costs and age, in order for a woman to carry a healthy pregnancy
to term. IVF is generally not used until less invasive or expensive options
have failed or been determined unlikely to work.
In 1978 Louise_Brown was the first child successfully born after her mother
received IVF treatment. Brown was born as a result of natural-cycle IVF, where
no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage
Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in Royton, Oldham, England. Robert_G.
Edwards was awarded the Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine in 2010. The
physiologist co-developed the treatment together with Patrick_Steptoe and
embryologist Jean_Purdy but the latter two were not eligible for consideration
as they had died and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.[1][2]
With egg_donation and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years, have
infertile male partners, have idiopathic female-fertility issues, or have
reached menopause, can still become pregnant. Adriana_Iliescu held the record
as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and a donor egg, when she gave
birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006. After the IVF
treatment, some couples get pregnant without any fertility treatments.[3] In
2018 it was estimated that eight million children had been born worldwide using
IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques.[4]

***** Terminology[edit] *****
The Latin term in_vitro, meaning "in glass", is used because early biological
experiments involving cultivation of tissues outside the living organism were
carried out in glass containers, such as beakers, test tubes, or Petri dishes.
Today, the scientific term "in vitro" is used to refer to any biological
procedure that is performed outside the organism in which it would normally
have occurred, to distinguish it from an in_vivo procedure (such as in_vivo
fertilisation), where the tissue remains inside the living organism in which it
is normally found.
A colloquial term for babies conceived as the result of IVF, "test tube
babies", refers to the tube-shaped containers of glass or plastic resin, called
test_tubes, that are commonly used in chemistry and biology labs. However, IVF
is usually performed in Petri_dishes, which are both wider and shallower and
often used to cultivate cultures.
In a broader sense, IVF is a form of assisted_reproductive_technology (ART).
***** Medical uses[edit] *****
**** Indications[edit] ****
Further information: Infertility
IVF may be used to overcome female_infertility when it is due to problems with
the fallopian_tubes, making in vivo fertilisation difficult. It can also assist
in male_infertility, in those cases where there is a defect in sperm_quality;
in such situations intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection (ICSI) may be used, where a
sperm cell is injected directly into the egg cell. This is used when sperm has
difficulty penetrating the egg. In these cases the partner's or a donor's sperm
may be used. ICSI is also used when sperm numbers are very low. When indicated,
the use of ICSI has been found to increase the success rates of IVF.[5]
According to UK's NICE guidelines, IVF treatment is appropriate in cases of
unexplained infertility for women who have not conceived after 2 years of
regular unprotected sexual intercourse.[5]
In women with anovulation, it may be an alternative after 7 - 12 attempted
cycles of ovulation_induction, since the latter is expensive and more easy to
control.[6]
**** Success rates[edit] ****
IVF success rates are the percentage of all IVF procedures that result in a
favourable outcome. Depending on the type of calculation used, this outcome may
represent the number of confirmed pregnancies, called the pregnancy_rate, or
the number of live births, called the live_birth_rate. The success rate depends
on variable factors such as maternal age, cause of infertility, embryo status,
reproductive history, and lifestyle factors.
Maternal age: Younger candidates of IVF are more likely to get pregnant. Women
older than 41 are more likely to get pregnant with a donor egg.[7]
Reproductive history: Women who have been previously pregnant are in many cases
more successful with IVF treatments than those who have never been pregnant.[7]
Due to advances in reproductive technology, IVF success rates are substantially
higher today than they were just a few years ago.[8]
*** Live birth rate[edit] ***
The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that lead to a live
birth. This rate does not include miscarriage or stillbirth; multiple-order
births, such as twins and triplets, are counted as one pregnancy. A 2012
summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine which reports the
average IVF success rates in the United States per age group using non-donor
eggs compiled the following data:[9]
                <35  35-37 38-40 41-42 >42
Pregnancy rate  46.7 37.8  29.7  19.8  8.6
Live birth rate 40.7 31.3  22.2  11.8  3.9
In 2006, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27%.[10] Birth rates in
younger patients were slightly higher, with a success rate of 35.3% for those
21 and younger, the youngest group evaluated. Success rates for older patients
were also lower and decrease with age, with 37-year-olds at 27.4% and no live
births for those older than 48, the oldest group evaluated.[11] Some clinics
exceeded these rates, but it is impossible to determine if that is due to
superior technique or patient selection, because it is possible to artificially
increase success rates by refusing to accept the most difficult patients or by
steering them into oocyte donation cycles (which are compiled separately).
Further, pregnancy rates can be increased by the placement of several embryos
at the risk of increasing the chance for multiples.
The live birth rates using donor eggs are also given by the SART and include
all age groups using either fresh or thawed eggs.[12]
                Fresh donor egg embryos Thawed donor egg embryos
Live birth rate 55.1                    33.8
Because not each IVF cycle that is started will lead to oocyte retrieval or
embryo transfer, reports of live birth rates need to specify the denominator,
namely IVF cycles started, IVF retrievals, or embryo transfers. The Society_for
Assisted_Reproductive_Technology (SART) summarised 2008-9 success rates for US
clinics for fresh embryo cycles that did not involve donor eggs and gave live
birth rates by the age of the prospective mother, with a peak at 41.3% per
cycle started and 47.3% per embryo transfer for patients under 35 years of age.
IVF attempts in multiple cycles result in increased cumulative live birth
rates. Depending on the demographic group, one study reported 45% to 53% for
three attempts, and 51% to 71% to 80% for six attempts.[13]
*** Pregnancy rate[edit] ***
Pregnancy rate may be defined in various ways. In the United States, the
pregnancy rate used by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and the
Centers for Disease Control (and appearing in the table in the Success Rates
section above) are based on fetal heart motion observed in ultrasound
examinations.
The 2009 summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine included the
following data for the United States:[12]
               <35  35-37 38-40 41-42
Pregnancy rate 47.6 38.9  30.1  20.5
In 2006, Canadian clinics reported an average pregnancy rate of 35%.[10] A
French study estimated that 66% of patients starting IVF treatment finally
succeed in having a child (40% during the IVF treatment at the centre and 26%
after IVF discontinuation). Achievement of having a child after IVF
discontinuation was mainly due to adoption (46%) or spontaneous_pregnancy
(42%).[14]
*** Predictors of success[edit] ***
The main potential factors that influence pregnancy (and live birth) rates in
IVF have been suggested to be maternal_age, duration of infertility or
subfertility, bFSH and number of oocytes, all reflecting ovarian_function.[15]
Optimal woman's age is 23â39 years at time of treatment.[16]
A triple-line_endometrium is associated with better IVF outcomes.[17]
Biomarkers that affect the pregnancy chances of IVF include:
    * Antral_follicle_count, with higher count giving higher success rates.[18]
    * Anti-MÃ¼llerian_hormone levels, with higher levels indicating higher
      chances of pregnancy,[18] as well as of live birth after IVF, even after
      adjusting for age.[19]
    * Factors of semen_quality for the sperm provider.
    * Level of DNA_fragmentation[20] as measured e.g. by Comet_assay, advanced
      maternal_age and semen_quality.
    * Women with ovary-specific FMR1 genotypes including het-norm/low have
      significantly decreased pregnancy chances in IVF.[21]
    * Progesterone elevation (PE) on the day of induction_of_final_maturation
      is associated with lower pregnancy rates in IVF cycles in women
      undergoing ovarian stimulation using GnRH analogues and gonadotrophins.
      [22] At this time, compared to a progesterone level below 0.8 ng/ml, a
      level between 0.8 and 1.1 ng/ml confers an odds_ratio of pregnancy of
      approximately 0.8, and a level between 1.2 and 3.0 ng/ml confers an odds
      ratio of pregnancy of between 0.6 and 0.7.[22] On the other hand,
      progesterone elevation does not seem to confer a decreased chance of
      pregnancy in frozenâthawed cycles and cycles with egg donation.[22]
    * Characteristics of cells from the cumulus_oophorus and the membrana
      granulosa, which are easily aspirated during oocyte_retrieval. These
      cells are closely associated with the oocyte and share the same
      microenvironment, and the rate of expression of certain genes in such
      cells are associated with higher or lower pregnancy rate.[23]
    * An endometrial thickness (EMT) of less than 7 mm decreases the pregnancy
      rate by an odds_ratio of approximately 0.4 compared to an EMT of over
      7 mm. However, such low thickness rarely occurs, and any routine use of
      this parameter is regarded as not justified.[24]
Other determinants of outcome of IVF include:
    * As the maternal age increases, the likelihood of conception decreases[25]
      and the chance of miscarriage increases.[26]
    * With increasing paternal age, especially 50 years and older, the rate of
      Blastocyst formation decreases.[27]
    * Tobacco_smoking reduces the chances of IVF producing a live birth by 34%
      and increases the risk of an IVF pregnancy miscarrying by 30%.[28]
    * A body_mass_index (BMI) over 27 causes a 33% decrease in likelihood to
      have a live birth after the first cycle of IVF, compared to those with a
      BMI between 20 and 27.[28] Also, pregnant women who are obese have higher
      rates of miscarriage, gestational_diabetes, hypertension, thromboembolism
      and problems during delivery, as well as leading to an increased risk of
      fetal congenital_abnormality.[28] Ideal body mass index is 19â30.[16]
    * Salpingectomy or laparoscopic tubal occlusion before IVF treatment
      increases chances for women with hydrosalpinges.[16][29]
    * Success with previous pregnancy and/or live birth increases chances[16]
    * Low alcohol/caffeine intake increases success rate[16]
    * The number of embryos transferred in the treatment cycle[30]
    * Embryo_quality
    * Some studies also suggest the autoimmune_disease may also play a role in
      decreasing IVF success rates by interfering with proper implantation of
      the embryo after transfer.[21]
Aspirin is sometimes prescribed to women for the purpose of increasing the
chances of conception by IVF, but as of 2016[update] there was no evidence to
show that it is safe and effective.[31][32]
A 2013 review and metaanalysis of randomised_controlled_trials of acupuncture
as an adjuvant_therapy in IVF found no overall benefit, and concluded that an
apparent benefit detected in a subset of published trials where the control
group (those not using acupuncture) experienced a lower than average rate of
pregnancy requires further study, due to the possibility of publication_bias
and other factors.[33]
A Cochrane_review came to the result that endometrial injury performed in the
month prior to ovarian induction appeared to increase both the live birth rate
and clinical pregnancy rate in IVF compared with no endometrial injury. There
was no evidence of a difference between the groups in miscarriage, multiple
pregnancy or bleeding rates. Evidence suggested that endometrial injury on the
day of oocyte retrieval was associated with a lower live birth or ongoing
pregnancy rate.[29][needs_update]
For women, intake of antioxidants (such as N-acetyl-cysteine, melatonin,
vitamin_A, vitamin_C, vitamin_E, folic_acid, myo-inositol, zinc or selenium)
has not been associated with a significantly increased live_birth_rate or
clinical pregnancy_rate in IVF according to Cochrane_reviews.[29] The review
found that oral antioxidants given to men in couples with male factor or
unexplained subfertility may improve live birth rates, but more evidence is
needed.[29]
A Cochrane_review in 2015 came to the result that there is no evidence
identified regarding the effect of pre-conception lifestyle advice on the
chance of a live birth outcome.[29]
***** Complications[edit] *****
**** Multiple births[edit] ****
The major complication of IVF is the risk of multiple_births. This is directly
related to the practice of transferring multiple embryos at embryo transfer.
Multiple births are related to increased risk of pregnancy loss, obstetrical
complications, prematurity, and neonatal morbidity with the potential for long
term damage. Strict limits on the number of embryos that may be transferred
have been enacted in some countries (e.g. Britain, Belgium) to reduce the risk
of high-order multiples (triplets or more), but are not universally followed or
accepted. Spontaneous splitting of embryos in the womb after transfer can
occur, but this is rare and would lead to identical twins. A double blind,
randomised study followed IVF pregnancies that resulted in 73 infants (33 boys
and 40 girls) and reported that 8.7% of singleton infants and 54.2% of twins
had a birth weight of < 2,500 grams (5.5 lb).[34]
Recent evidence also suggest that singleton offspring after IVF is at higher
risk for lower birth weight for unknown reasons.
**** Sex ratio distortions[edit] ****
Certain kinds of IVF, in particular ICSI (first applied in 1991) and blastocyst
transfer (first applied in 1984) have been shown to lead to distortions in the
sex_ratio at birth. ICSI leads to slightly more female births (51.3% female)
while blastocyst transfer leads to significantly more boys (56.1% male) being
born. Standard IVF done at the second or third day leads to a normal sex ratio.
Epigenetic modifications caused by extended culture leading to the death of
more female embryos has been theorised as the reason why blastocyst transfer
leads to a higher male sex ratio, however adding retinoic acid to the culture
can bring this ratio back to normal.[35]
**** Spread of infectious disease[edit] ****
By sperm_washing, the risk that a chronic disease in the male providing the
sperm would infect the female or offspring can be brought to negligible levels.
In males with hepatitis_B, The Practice Committee of the American Society for
Reproductive Medicine advises that sperm washing is not necessary in IVF to
prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively
vaccinated.[36][37] In females with hepatitis B, the risk of vertical
transmission during IVF is no different from the risk in spontaneous
conception.[37] However, there is not enough evidence to say that ICSI
procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical
transmission to the offspring.[37]
Regarding potential spread of HIV/AIDS, Japan's government prohibited the use
of IVF procedures for couples in which both partners are infected with HIV.
Despite the fact that the ethics committees previously allowed the Ogikubo,
Tokyo Hospital, located in Tokyo, to use IVF for couples with HIV, the Ministry
of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare of Japan decided to block the practice. Hideji
Hanabusa, the vice president of the Ogikubo Hospital, states that together with
his colleagues, he managed to develop a method through which scientists are
able to remove HIV from sperm.[38]
**** Other risks to the egg provider/retriever[edit] ****
A risk of ovarian stimulation is the development of ovarian_hyperstimulation
syndrome, particularly if hCG is used for inducing_final_oocyte_maturation.
This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild
cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be
resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and
fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of heartburn,
gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation.
During egg retrieval, there exists a small chance of bleeding, infection, and
damage to surrounding structures like bowel and bladder (transvaginal
ultrasound aspiration) as well as difficulty in breathing, chest infection,
allergic reactions to medication, or nerve damage (laproscopy).
Ectopic_pregnancy may also occur if a fertilised egg develops outside the
uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes and requires immediate destruction of
the fetus.
IVF does not seem to be associated with an elevated risk of cervical_cancer,
nor with ovarian_cancer or endometrial_cancer when neutralising the confounder
of infertility itself.[39] Nor does it seem to impart any increased risk for
breast_cancer.[40]
Regardless of pregnancy result, IVF treatment is usually stressful for
patients.[41] Neuroticism and the use of escapist coping strategies are
associated with a higher degree of distress, while the presence of social
support has a relieving effect.[41] A negative pregnancy test after IVF is
associated with an increased risk for depression in women, but not with any
increased risk of developing anxiety_disorders.[42] Pregnancy test results do
not seem to be a risk factor for depression or anxiety among men.[42]
Studies show that there is an increased risk of venous_thrombosis or pulmonary
embolism during the first trimester of IVF.[43] When looking at long term
studies comparing women who received or did not receive IVF, there seems to be
no correlation with increased risk of cardiac events. There are more ongoing
studies to solidify this. [44]
Spontaneous_pregnancy has occurred after successful and unsuccessful IVF
treatments.[45] Within 2 years of delivering an infant conceived through IVF,
subfertile couples had a conception rate of 18%. [46]
**** Birth defects[edit] ****
A review in 2013 came to the result that infants resulting from IVF (with or
without ICSI) have a relative_risk of birth defects of 1.32 (95% confidence
interval 1.24â1.42) compared to naturally conceived infants.[47] In 2008, an
analysis of the data of the National Birth Defects Study in the US found that
certain birth defects were significantly more common in infants conceived
through IVF, notably septal_heart_defects, cleft_lip with or without cleft
palate, esophageal_atresia, and anorectal_atresia; the mechanism of causality
is unclear.[48] However, in a population-wide cohort study of 308,974 births
(with 6163 using assisted reproductive technology and following children from
birth to age five) researchers found: "The increased risk of birth defects
associated with IVF was no longer significant after adjustment for parental
factors." [49] Parental factors included known independent risks for birth
defects such as maternal age, smoking status, etc. Multivariate correction did
not remove the significance of the association of birth defects and ICSI
(corrected odds ratio 1.57), although the authors speculate that underlying
male infertility factors (which would be associated with the use of ICSI) may
contribute to this observation and were not able to correct for these
confounders. The authors also found that a history of infertility elevated risk
itself in the absence of any treatment (odds ratio 1.29), consistent with a
Danish national registry study [50] and "...implicates patient factors in this
increased risk." The authors of the Danish national registry study speculate:
"...our results suggest that the reported increased prevalence of congenital
malformations seen in singletons born after assisted reproductive technology is
partly due to the underlying infertility or its determinants."

**** Other risks to the offspring[edit] ****
If the underlying infertility is related to abnormalities in spermatogenesis,
it is plausible, but too early to examine that male offspring are at higher
risk for sperm abnormalities.[clarification_needed]
IVF does not seem to confer any risks regarding cognitive development, school
performance, social functioning, and behaviour.[52] Also, IVF infants are known
to be as securely attached to their parents as those who were naturally
conceived, and IVF adolescents are as well-adjusted as those who have been
naturally conceived.[53]
Limited long-term follow-up data suggest that IVF may be associated with an
increased incidence of hypertension, impaired_fasting_glucose, increase in
total body_fat composition, advancement of bone_age, subclinical thyroid
disorder, early adulthood clinical_depression and binge_drinking in the
offspring.[52][54] It is not known, however, whether these potential
associations are caused by the IVF procedure in itself, by adverse obstetric
outcomes associated with IVF, by the genetic origin of the children or by yet
unknown IVF-associated causes.[52][54] Increases in embryo manipulation during
IVF result in more deviant fetal growth curves, but birth weight does not seem
to be a reliable marker of fetal stress.[55]
IVF, including ICSI, is associated with an increased risk of imprinting
disorders (including Prader-Willi_syndrome and Angelman_syndrome), with an odds
ratio of 3.7 (95% confidence_interval 1.4 to 9.7).[56]
An IVF-associated incidence of cerebral_palsy and neurodevelopmental_delay are
believed to be related to the confounders of prematurity and low birthweight.
[52] Similarly, an IVF-associated incidence of autism and attention-deficit
disorder are believed to be related to confounders of maternal and obstetric
factors.[52]
Overall, IVF does not cause an increased risk of childhood_cancer.[57] Studies
have shown a decrease in the risk of certain cancers and an increased risks of
certain others including retinoblastoma[58] hepatoblastoma[57] and
rhabdomyosarcoma.[57]
***** Method[edit] *****
A depiction of the procedure of in-vitro fertilisation.
Theoretically, IVF could be performed by collecting the contents from a woman's
fallopian tubes or uterus after natural ovulation, mixing it with sperm, and
reinserting the fertilised ova into the uterus. However, without additional
techniques, the chances of pregnancy would be extremely small. The additional
techniques that are routinely used in IVF include ovarian_hyperstimulation to
generate multiple eggs, ultrasound-guided transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval
directly from the ovaries, co-incubation of eggs and sperm, as well as culture
and selection of resultant embryos before embryo_transfer into a uterus.
**** Ovarian hyperstimulation[edit] ****
Main article: Controlled_ovarian_hyperstimulation
Ovarian hyperstimulation is the stimulation to induce development of multiple
follicles of the ovaries. It should start with response prediction by e.g. age,
antral_follicle_count and level of anti-MÃ¼llerian_hormone.[59] The resulting
prediction of e.g. poor or hyper-response to ovarian hyperstimulation
determines the protocol and dosage for ovarian hyperstimulation.[59]
Ovarian hyperstimulation also includes suppression of spontaneous ovulation,
for which two main methods are available: Using a (usually longer) GnRH_agonist
protocol or a (usually shorter) GnRH_antagonist protocol.[59] In a standard
long GnRH agonist protocol the day when hyperstimulation treatment is started
and the expected day of later oocyte retrieval can be chosen to conform to
personal choice, while in a GnRH antagonist protocol it must be adapted to the
spontaneous onset of the previous menstruation. On the other hand, the GnRH
antagonist protocol has a lower risk of ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome
(OHSS), which is a life-threatening complication.[59]
For the ovarian hyperstimulation in itself, injectable gonadotropins (usually
FSH analogues) are generally used under close monitoring. Such monitoring
frequently checks the estradiol level and, by means of gynecologic
ultrasonography, follicular growth. Typically approximately 10 days of
injections will be necessary.
**** Natural IVF[edit] ****
Main article: Natural_cycle_in_vitro_fertilisation
There are several methods termed natural cycle IVF:[60]
    * IVF using no drugs for ovarian_hyperstimulation, while drugs for
      ovulation_suppression may still be used.
    * IVF using ovarian hyperstimulation, including gonadotropins, but with a
      GnRH_antagonist protocol so that the cycle initiates from natural
      mechanisms.
    * Frozen_embryo_transfer; IVF using ovarian_hyperstimulation, followed by
      embryo_cryopreservation, followed by embryo_transfer in a later, natural,
      cycle.[61]
IVF using no drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation was the method for the
conception of Louise_Brown. This method can be successfully used when women
want to avoid taking ovarian stimulating drugs with its associated side-
effects. HFEA has estimated the live_birth_rate to be approximately 1.3% per
IVF cycle using no hyperstimulation drugs for women aged between 40â42.[62]
Mild IVF[63] is a method where a small dose of ovarian stimulating drugs are
used for a short duration during a woman's natural cycle aimed at producing
2â7 eggs and creating healthy embryos. This method appears to be an advance
in the field to reduce complications and side-effects for women and it is aimed
at quality, and not quantity of eggs and embryos. One study comparing a mild
treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with GnRH antagonist co-treatment combined
with single_embryo_transfer) to a standard treatment (stimulation with a GnRH
agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos) came to the result that the
proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term live_birth after 1
year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment.[64] Mild
IVF can be cheaper than conventional IVF and with a significantly reduced risk
of multiple_gestation and OHSS.[65]
**** Final maturation induction[edit] ****
Further information: Final_maturation_induction
When the ovarian follicles have reached a certain degree of development,
induction_of_final_oocyte_maturation is performed, generally by an injection of
human_chorionic_gonadotropin (hCG). Commonly, this is known as the "trigger
shot."[66] hCG acts as an analogue of luteinising_hormone, and ovulation would
occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection,[67] but the egg
retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG
injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This avails
for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully
mature. HCG injection confers a risk of ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome.
Using a GnRH_agonist instead of hCG eliminates most of the risk of ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome, but with a reduced delivery rate if the embryos are
transferred fresh.[68] For this reason, many centers will freeze all oocytes or
embryos following agonist trigger.
**** Egg retrieval[edit] ****
Further information: Transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval
The eggs are retrieved from the patient using a transvaginal technique called
transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval, involving an ultrasound-guided needle piercing
the vaginal wall to reach the ovaries. Through this needle follicles can be
aspirated, and the follicular fluid is passed to an embryologist to identify
ova. It is common to remove between ten and thirty eggs. The retrieval
procedure usually takes between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the number of
mature follicles, and is usually done under conscious_sedation or general
anaesthesia.
**** Egg and sperm preparation[edit] ****
In the laboratory, the identified eggs are stripped of surrounding cells and
prepared for fertilisation. An oocyte_selection may be performed prior to
fertilisation to select eggs with optimal chances of successful pregnancy. In
the meantime, semen is prepared for fertilisation by removing inactive cells
and seminal fluid in a process called sperm_washing. If semen is being provided
by a sperm_donor, it will usually have been prepared for treatment before being
frozen and quarantined, and it will be thawed ready for use.
**** Co-incubation[edit] ****
Demonstration of IVF
The sperm and the egg are incubated together at a ratio of about 75,000:1 in a
culture_media in order for the actual fertilisation to take place. A review in
2013 came to the result that a duration of this co-incubation of about 1 to 4
hours results in significantly higher pregnancy_rates than 16 to 24 hours.[69]
In most cases, the egg will be fertilised during co-incubation and will show
two pronuclei. In certain situations, such as low sperm count or motility, a
single sperm may be injected directly into the egg using intracytoplasmic_sperm
injection (ICSI). The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and
left for about 48 hours until the egg consists of six to eight cells.
In gamete_intrafallopian_transfer, eggs are removed from the woman and placed
in one of the fallopian tubes, along with the man's sperm. This allows
fertilisation to take place inside the woman's body. Therefore, this variation
is actually an in vivo fertilisation, not in vitro.
**** Embryo culture[edit] ****
Main article: Embryo_culture
The main durations of embryo culture are until cleavage_stage (day two to four
after co-incubation) or the blastocyst stage (day five or six after co-
incubation).[70] Embryo culture until the blastocyst stage confers a
significant increase in live_birth_rate per embryo_transfer, but also confers a
decreased number of embryos available for transfer and embryo_cryopreservation,
so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage
transfer.[29] Transfer day two instead of day three after fertilisation has no
differences in live_birth_rate.[29] There are significantly higher odds of
preterm_birth (odds_ratio 1.3) and congenital_anomalies (odds_ratio 1.3) among
births having from embryos cultured until the blastocyst stage compared with
cleavage stage.[70]
**** Embryo selection[edit] ****
Further information: Embryo_quality
Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge ovocyte and embryo
quality. In order to optimise pregnancy_rates, there is significant evidence
that a morphological scoring system is the best strategy for the selection of
embryos.[71] Since 2009 where the first time-lapse_microscopy system for IVF
was approved for clinical use,[72] morphokinetic scoring systems has shown to
improve to pregnancy_rates further.[73] However, when all different types of
time-lapse_embryo_imaging devices, with or without morphokinetic scoring
systems, are compared against conventional embryo assessment for IVF, there is
insufficient evidence of a difference in live-birth, pregnancy, stillbirth or
miscarriage to choose between them.[74][needs_update]
**** Embryo transfer[edit] ****
Main article: Embryo_transfer
The number to be transferred depends on the number available, the age of the
woman and other health and diagnostic factors. In countries such as Canada, the
UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two embryos are transferred except
in unusual circumstances. In the UK and according to HFEA regulations, a woman
over 40 may have up to three embryos transferred, whereas in the US, there is
no legal limit on the number of embryos which may be transferred, although
medical associations have provided practice guidelines. Most clinics and
country regulatory bodies seek to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, as
it is not uncommon for multiple embryos to implant if multiple embryos are
transferred. Embryos are transferred to the patient's uterus through a thin,
plastic catheter, which goes through her vagina and cervix. Several embryos may
be passed into the uterus to improve chances of implantation and pregnancy.
**** Luteal support[edit] ****
Main article: Luteal_support
Luteal_support is the administration of medication, generally progesterone,
progestins, hCG, or GnRH_agonists, and often accompanied by estradiol, to
increase the success rate of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby
complementing and/or supporting the function of the corpus_luteum. A Cochrane
review found that hCG or progesterone given during the luteal phase may be
associated with higher rates of live_birth or ongoing pregnancy, but that the
evidence is not conclusive.[75] Co-treatment with GnRH_agonists appears to
improve outcomes,[75] by a live birth rate RD of +16% (95% confidence_interval
+10 to +22%).[76] On the other hand, growth_hormone or aspirin as adjunctive
medication in IVF have no evidence of overall benefit.[29]
**** Ovulation induction[edit] ****
Main article: Ovulation_induction
Ovulation_induction is a method used in IVF that stimulates ovulation. The main
drug used for ovulation induction is clomifene and it has shown success with
patients who do not ovulate or those with polycystic_ovary_syndrome. In
addition, this method has minimal risk of ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome
(OHSS), though this risk increases when clomifene is used with a gonadotropin.
[77]
***** Expansions[edit] *****
There are various expansions or additional techniques that can be applied in
IVF, which are usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be
virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without concomitantly
performing methods of IVF.
**** Preimplantation genetic screening or diagnosis[edit] ****
Main article: Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis
Preimplantation_genetic_screening (PGS) or preimplantation genetic diagnosis
(PGD) has been suggested to be able to be used in IVF to select an embryo that
appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, a
systematic review and meta-analysis of existing randomised_controlled_trials
came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGS with
cleavage-stage biopsy as measured by live_birth_rate.[78] On the contrary, for
women of advanced_maternal_age, PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy significantly
lowers the live birth rate.[78] Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness
of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of mosaicism are the
major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS.[78]
Still, as an expansion of IVF, patients who can benefit from PGS/PGD include:
    * Couples who have a family history of inherited disease
    * Couples who want prenatal_sex_discernment. This can be used to diagnose
      monogenic_disorders with sex_linkage. It can potentially be used for sex
      selection, wherein a fetus is aborted if having an undesired sex.
    * Couples who already have a child with an incurable disease and need
      compatible cells from a second healthy child to cure the first, resulting
      in a "saviour_sibling" that matches the sick child in HLA_type.[79]
PGS screens for numeral chromosomal abnormalities while PGD diagnosis the
specific molecular defect of the inherited disease. In both PGS and PGD,
individual cells from a pre-embryo, or preferably trophectoderm cells biopsied
from a blastocyst, are analysed during the IVF process. Before the transfer of
a pre-embryo back to a woman's uterus, one or two cells are removed from the
pre-embryos (8-cell stage), or preferably from a blastocyst. These cells are
then evaluated for normality. Typically within one to two days, following
completion of the evaluation, only the normal pre-embryos are transferred back
to the woman's uterus. Alternatively, a blastocyst can be cryopreserved via
vitrification and transferred at a later date to the uterus. In addition, PGS
can significantly reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies because fewer
embryos, ideally just one, are needed for implantation.
**** Cryopreservation[edit] ****
Main articles: Oocyte_cryopreservation and Embryo_cryopreservation
Cryopreservation can be performed as oocyte_cryopreservation before
fertilisation, or as embryo_cryopreservation after fertilisation.
The Rand Consulting Group has estimated there to be 400,000 frozen embryos in
the United States in 2006.[80] The advantage is that patients who fail to
conceive may become pregnant using such embryos without having to go through a
full IVF cycle. Or, if pregnancy occurred, they could return later for another
pregnancy. Spare oocytes or embryos resulting from fertility treatments may be
used for oocyte_donation or embryo_donation to another woman or couple, and
embryos may be created, frozen and stored specifically for transfer and
donation by using donor eggs and sperm. Also, oocyte cryopreservation can be
used for women who are likely to lose their ovarian reserve due to undergoing
chemotherapy.[81]
By 2017, many centers have adopted embryo cryopreservation as their primary IVF
therapy, and perform few or no fresh embryo transfers. The two main reasons for
this have been better endometrial receptivity when embryos are transferred in
cycles without exposure to ovarian stimulation and also the ability to store
the embryos while awaiting the results of pre-implantation genetic testing.
The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with
no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities.[82]
**** Other expansions[edit] ****
    * Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection (ICSI) is where a single sperm is
      injected directly into an egg. Its main usage as an expansion of IVF is
      to overcome male infertility problems, although it may also be used where
      eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in
      conjunction with sperm_donation. It can be used in teratozoospermia,
      since once the egg is fertilised abnormal sperm morphology does not
      appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology.[83]
    * Additional methods of embryo_profiling. For example, methods are emerging
      in making comprehensive analyses of up to entire genomes, transcriptomes,
      proteomes and metabolomes which may be used to score embryos by comparing
      the patterns with ones that have previously been found among embryos in
      successful versus unsuccessful pregnancies.[84]
    * Assisted_zona_hatching (AZH) can be performed shortly before the embryo
      is transferred to the uterus. A small opening is made in the outer layer
      surrounding the egg in order to help the embryo hatch out and aid in the
      implantation process of the growing embryo.
    * In egg_donation and embryo_donation, the resultant embryo after
      fertilisation is inserted in another woman than the one providing the
      eggs. These are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery,
      chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously
      unsuccessful IVF cycles or advanced_maternal_age. In the egg donor
      process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilised in the
      laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting
      healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus.
    * In oocyte_selection, the oocytes with optimal chances of live_birth can
      be chosen. It can also be used as a means of preimplantation_genetic
      screening.
    * Embryo_splitting can be used for twinning to increase the number of
      available embryos.[85]
    * Cytoplasmic_transfer is where the cytoplasm from a donor egg is injected
      into an egg with compromised mitochondria. The resulting egg is then
      fertilised with sperm and implanted in a womb, usually that of the woman
      who provided the recipient egg and nuclear_DNA. Cytoplasmic transfer was
      created to aid women who experience infertility due to deficient or
      damaged mitochondria, contained within an egg's cytoplasm.
***** Leftover embryos or eggs[edit] *****
Further information: Embryo_donation and Egg_donor
There may be leftover embryos or eggs from IVF procedures if the woman for whom
they were originally created has successfully carried one or more pregnancies
to term. With the woman's or couple's permission, these may be donated to help
other women or couples as a means of third_party_reproduction.
In embryo_donation, these extra embryos are given to other couples or women for
transfer with the goal of producing a successful pregnancy. The resulting child
is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not
the child of the donor, the same as occurs with egg_donation or sperm_donation.
Typically, genetic parents donate the eggs to a fertility_clinic or where they
are preserved by oocyte_cryopreservation or embryo_cryopreservation until a
carrier is found for them. Typically the process of matching the embryo(s) with
the prospective parents is conducted by the agency itself, at which time the
clinic transfers ownership of the embryos to the prospective parents.[86]
In the United States, women seeking to be an embryo recipient undergo
infectious disease screening required by the U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration
(FDA), and reproductive tests to determine the best placement location and
cycle timing before the actual Embryo Transfer occurs. The amount of screening
the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents'
own IVF clinic and process. The embryo recipient may elect to have her own
embryologist conduct further testing.
Alternatives to donating unused embryos are destroying them (or having them
implanted at a time where pregnancy is very unlikely),[87] keeping them frozen
indefinitely, or donating them for use in research (which results in their
unviability).[88] Individual moral views on disposing leftover embryos may
depend on personal views on the beginning_of_human_personhood and definition
and/or value of potential_future_persons and on the value that is given to
fundamental research questions. Some people believe donation of leftover
embryos for research is a good alternative to discarding the embryos when
patients receive proper, honest and clear information about the research
project, the procedures and the scientific values.[89]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_in_vitro_fertilisation
The first successful birth of a child after IVF treatment, Louise_Brown,
occurred in 1978. Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF where
no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage
Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in Royton, Oldham, England. Robert_G.
Edwards was awarded the Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine in 2010, the
physiologist who co-developed the treatment together with Patrick_Steptoe and
embryologist Jean_Purdy; Steptoe and Purdy were not eligible for consideration
as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.[1][2]
The second successful birth of a test tube baby occurred in India just 67 days
after Louise Brown was born.[90] The girl, named Durga conceived in vitro using
a method developed independently by Dr. Subhash_Mukhopadhyay, a physician and
researcher from Kolkata, India.
With egg_donation and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years, have
infertile male partners, have idiopathic female-fertility issues, or have
reached menopause can still become pregnant. Adriana_Iliescu held the record as
the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and a donor egg, when she gave birth
in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006. After the IVF treatment some
couples are able to get pregnant without any fertility treatments.[3] In 2018
it was estimated that eight million children had been born worldwide using IVF
and other assisted reproduction techniques.[4]
***** Ethics[edit] *****
**** Mix-ups[edit] ****
In some cases, laboratory mix-ups (misidentified gametes, transfer of wrong
embryos) have occurred, leading to legal action against the IVF provider and
complex paternity suits. An example is the case of a woman in California who
received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after
the birth of her son.[91] This has led to many authorities and individual
clinics implementing procedures to minimise the risk of such mix-ups. The HFEA,
for example, requires clinics to use a double witnessing system, the identity
of specimens is checked by two people at each point at which specimens are
transferred. Alternatively, technological solutions are gaining favour, to
reduce the manpower cost of manual double witnessing, and to further reduce
risks with uniquely numbered RFID tags which can be identified by readers
connected to a computer. The computer tracks specimens throughout the process
and alerts the embryologist if non-matching specimens are identified. Although
the use of RFID tracking has expanded in the US,[92] it is still not widely
adopted.
**** Preimplantation genetic diagnosis or screening[edit] ****
While PGD was originally designed to screen for embryos carrying hereditary
genetic diseases, the method has been applied to select features that are
unrelated to diseases, thus raising ethical questions. Examples of such cases
include the selection of embryos based on histocompatibility (HLA) for the
donation of tissues to a sick family member, the diagnosis of genetic
susceptibility to disease, and sex selection.[93]
These examples raise ethical issues because of the morality of eugenics. It
becomes frowned upon because of the advantage of being able to eliminate
unwanted traits and selecting desired traits. By using preimplantation_genetic
diagnosis (PGD) or preimplantation genetic screening, individuals are given the
opportunity to create a human life unethically and rely on science and not by
natural selection.[94]
For example, a deaf British couple, Tom and Paula Lichy, have petitioned to
create a deaf baby using IVF.[95] Some medical_ethicists have been very
critical of this approach. Jacob_M._Appel wrote that "intentionally culling out
blind or deaf embryos might prevent considerable future suffering, while a
policy that allowed deaf or blind parents to select for such traits
intentionally would be far more troublesome."[96]
**** Profit desire of the industry[edit] ****
Many people do not oppose the IVF practice itself (i.e. the creating of a
pregnancy through "artificial" ways) but are highly critical of the current
state of the present day industry. Such individuals argue that the industry has
now become a multibillion-dollar industry, which is widely unregulated and
prone to serious abuses in the desire of practitioners to obtain profit. For
instance, in 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who
gave birth to octuplets (see Suleman_octuplets). This has made international
news, and had led to accusations that many doctors are willing to seriously
endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert
Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called
the industry "corrupt" and "greedy" saying that "One of the major problems
facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry,"
and that "What has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole
technology", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from
exploitation "The regulatory authority has done a consistently bad job. It's
not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information
to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have
access to".[97] The IVF industry can thus be seen as an example of what social
scientists are describing as an increasing trend towards a market-driven
construction of health, medicine and the human body.[98]
As the science progresses, the industry is further driven by money in that
researchers and innovators enter into the fight over patents and intellectual
property rights. The Copyright_Clause in the US Constitution protects
innovator's rights to their respective work in attempts to promote scientific
progress. Essentially, this lawful protection gives incentive to the innovators
by providing them a temporary monopoly over their respective work. In the IVF
industry, already incredibly expensive for patients, patents risk even higher
prices for the patients to receive the procedure as they have to also cover the
costs of protected works. For example, company 23andMe has patented a process
used to calculate probability of gene inheritance.[99] While this innovation
could help many, the company retains sole right to administer it and thus does
not have economic competition. Lack of economic competition leads to higher
prices of products.
The industry has been accused of making unscientific claims, and distorting
facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims
about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many
couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than
trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing
infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple
biological malfunction, which not only can be treated through bio-medical
procedures, but should be treated by them.[100][101] Indeed, there are serious
concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr Sami David, a
fertility specialist and one of the pioneers of the early days of the IVF
treatments, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the
industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: "It's being the
first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first
opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort. Now
it's a first resort. I think that's an injustice to women. I also think it can
harm women in the long run."[102] IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the
abuse of bio-medical facts to 'sell' corrective procedures and treatments for
conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the 'healthy' or 'normal'
body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-
producing offspring.
**** IVF over age 40[edit] ****
All pregnancies can be risky, but there are greater risk for women who are
older and are over the age of 40. The older the women the riskier the
pregnancy. As women get older, they are more likely to suffer from conditions
such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. If older women do conceive over
the age of 40, their offspring may be of lower birth weight, and more likely to
requires intensive care. Because of this, the increased risk is a sufficient
cause for concern. The high incidence of caesarean in older mothers is commonly
regarded as a risk.
Though there are some risk with older women pregnancies, there are some
benefits associated with caesareans. A study has shown that births over 40 have
a lower rate of birth trauma due to increased delivery by caesarean. Though
caesarean is seen to benefit mothers over 40, there are still many risk factors
to consider. Caesarean section may be a risk in the same way that gestational
diabetes is.
Women conceiving at 40 have a greater risk of gestational hypertension and
premature birth. The offspring is at risk when being born from older mothers,
and the risks associated with being conceived through IVF.[103]
Normal Vaginal Canal Vs Menopause
**** Pregnancy past menopause[edit] ****
Although menopause is a natural barrier to further conception, IVF has allowed
women to be pregnant in their fifties and sixties. Women whose uteruses have
been appropriately prepared receive embryos that originated from an egg of an
egg donor. Therefore, although these women do not have a genetic link with the
child, they have a physical link through pregnancy and childbirth. In many
cases the genetic father of the child is the woman's partner. Even after
menopause the uterus is fully capable of carrying out a pregnancy.[104]
**** Same-sex couples, single and unmarried parents[edit] ****
See also: Donor_conceived_person
A 2009 statement from the ASRM found no persuasive evidence that children are
harmed or disadvantaged solely by being raised by single parents, unmarried
parents, or homosexual parents. It did not support restricting access to
assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of a prospective parent's
marital status or sexual orientation.[105]
Ethical concerns include reproductive rights, the welfare of offspring,
nondiscrimination against unmarried individuals, homosexual, and professional
autonomy.[105]
A recent controversy in California focused on the question of whether
physicians opposed to same-sex relationships should be required to perform IVF
for a lesbian couple. Guadalupe T. Benitez, a lesbian medical assistant from
San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast
Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her that she had "religious-based
objections to treating her and homosexuals in general to help them conceive
children by artificial insemination," and Fenton refused to authorise a refill
of her prescription for the fertility drug Clomid on the same grounds.[106]
[107] The California Medical Association had initially sided with Brody and
Fenton, but the case, North_Coast_Women's_Care_Medical_Group_v._Superior_Court,
was decided unanimously by the California State Supreme Court in favour of
Benitez on 19 August 2008.[108][109]
IVF is increasingly being used to allow lesbian and other LGBT couples to share
in the reproductive process through a technique called reciprocal_IVF.[110] The
eggs of one partner are used to create embryos which the other partner carries
through pregnancy.
Nadya_Suleman came to international attention after having twelve embryos
implanted, eight of which survived, resulting in eight newborns being added to
her existing six-child family. The Medical Board of California sought to have
fertility doctor Michael Kamrava, who treated Suleman, stripped of his licence.
State officials allege that performing Suleman's procedure is evidence of
unreasonable judgment, substandard care, and a lack of concern for the eight
children she would conceive and the six she was already struggling to raise. On
1 June 2011 the Medical Board issued a ruling that Kamrava's medical licence be
revoked effective 1 July 2011.[111][112] [113]
**** Anonymous donors[edit] ****
Further information: Donor_conceived_person
Some children conceived by IVF using anonymous donors report being troubled
over not knowing about their donor parent as well any genetic relatives they
may have and their family history.[114][115]
Alana Stewart, who was conceived using donor sperm, began an online forum for
donor children called AnonymousUS in 2010. The forum welcomes the viewpoints of
anyone involved in the IVF process.[116] Olivia Pratten, a donor-conceived
Canadian, sued the province of British Columbia for access to records on her
donor father's identity in 2008.[117] "I'm not a treatment, I'm a person, and
those records belong to me," Pratten said.[114] In May 2012, a court ruled in
Pratten's favour, agreeing that the laws at the time discriminated against
donor children and making anonymous sperm and egg donation in British Columbia
illegal.[117]
In the U.K., Sweden, Norway, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and some Australian
states, donors are not paid and cannot be anonymous.
In 2000, a website called Donor_Sibling_Registry was created to help biological
children with a common donor connect with each other.[115][118]
In 2012, a documentary called Anonymous Father's Day was released that focuses
on donor-conceived children.[119]
**** Unwanted embryos[edit] ****
During the selection and transfer phases, many embryos may be discarded in
favour of others. This selection may be based on criteria such as genetic
disorders or the sex.[120] One of the earliest cases of special gene selection
through IVF was the case of the Collins family in the 1990s, who selected the
sex of their child.[121] The ethic issues remain unresolved as no consensus
exists in science, religion, and philosophy on when a human embryo should be
recognised as a person. For those who believe that this is at the moment of
conception, IVF becomes a moral question when multiple eggs are fertilised,
begin development, and only a few are chosen for implantation.[citation_needed]
If IVF were to involve the fertilisation of only a single egg, or at least only
the number that will be implanted, then this would not be an issue. However,
this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be
attempted at a time. As a result, the couple must decide what to do with these
extra embryos. Depending on their view of the embryo's humanity or the chance
the couple will want to try to have another child, the couple has multiple
options for dealing with these extra embryos. Couples can choose to keep them
frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to
medical research.[87] Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not
ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and
medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical
research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for,
and as a result, some can be used in stem_cell research, a field perceived to
have ethical issues.
**** Religious response[edit] ****
Main article: Religious_response_to_assisted_reproductive_technology
The Catholic_Church opposes all kinds of assisted_reproductive_technology and
artificial contraception, on the grounds that they separate the procreative
goal of marital_sex from the goal of uniting married couples. The Catholic
Church permits the use of a small number of reproductive technologies and
contraceptive methods like natural_family_planning, which involves charting
ovulation times, and allows other forms of reproductive technologies that allow
conception to take place from normative sexual intercourse, such as a fertility
lubricant. Pope Benedict XVI had publicly re-emphasised the Catholic Church's
opposition to in vitro fertilisation, saying that it replaces love between a
husband and wife.[122]
The Catechism of the Catholic Church, in accordance with the Catholic
understanding of natural_law, teaches that reproduction has an "inseparable
connection" to the sexual union of married couples.[123] In addition, the
church opposes IVF because it might result in the disposal of embryos; in
Catholicism, an embryo is viewed as an individual with a soul that must be
treated as a person.[124] The Catholic Church maintains that it is not
objectively evil to be infertile, and advocates adoption as an option for such
couples who still wish to have children.[125]
Hindus welcome IVF as gift for those who are unable to bear children and have
declared doctors related to IVF to be conducting punya as there are several
characters who were claimed to be born without intercourse, mainly Kaurav and
five Pandavas.[126]
Regarding the response to IVF of Islam, the conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad
El-Hak's ART fatwa include that:[127]
    * IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the
      transfer of the fertilised egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed,
      provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is
      carried out by an expert physician.
    * Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span
      of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital
      functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is
      not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a
      uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to zina, or adultery.
Within the Orthodox_Jewish community the concept is debated as there is little
precedent in traditional Jewish legal textual sources. Regarding laws_of
sexuality, religious challenges include masturbation (which may be regarded as
"seed wasting"[124]), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation (niddah)
and the specific laws regarding intercourse. An additional major issue is that
of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the
father's identity is determined by a legal presumption (chazakah) of
legitimacy: rov bi'ot achar ha'baal - a woman's sexual_relations are assumed to
be with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and
as such Rabbi Eliezer_Waldenberg (among others) requires an outside supervisor
to positively identify the father.[128] Reform_Judaism has generally approved
IVF.[124]
**** Society and culture[edit] ****
Many people of sub-Saharan Africa choose to foster their children to infertile
women. IVF enables these infertile women to have their own children, which
imposes new ideals to a culture in which fostering children is seen as both
natural and culturally important. Many infertile women are able to earn more
respect in their society by taking care of the children of other mothers, and
this may be lost if they choose to use IVF instead. As IVF is seen as
unnatural, it may even hinder their societal position as opposed to making them
equal with fertile women. It is also economically advantageous for infertile
women to raise foster children as it gives these children greater ability to
access resources that are important for their development and also aids the
development of their society at large. If IVF becomes more popular without the
birth rate decreasing, there could be more large family homes with fewer
options to send their newborn children. This could result in an increase of
orphaned children and/or a decrease in resources for the children of large
families. This would ultimately stifle the children's and the community's
growth.[129]
***** Emotional involvement[edit] *****
Studies have indicated that IVF mothers show greater emotional involvement with
their child, and they enjoy motherhood more than mothers by natural conception.
Similarly, studies have indicated that IVF fathers express more warmth and
emotional involvement than fathers by adoption and natural conception and enjoy
fatherhood more. Some IVF parents become overly involved with their children.
[130]
***** Men and IVF[edit] *****
Research has shown that men largely view themselves as 'passive' contributors
[131] since they have 'less physical involvement'[132] in IVF treatment.
Despite this, many men feel distressed after seeing the toll of hormonal
injections and ongoing physical intervention on their female partner.[133]
Fertility was found to be a significant factor in a man's perception of his
masculinity, driving many to keep the treatment a secret.[133] In cases where
the men did share that he and his partner were undergoing IVF, they reported to
have been teased, mainly by other men, although some viewed this as an
affirmation of support and friendship. For others, this led to feeling socially
isolated.[134] In comparison with women, men showed less deterioration in
mental health in the years following a failed treatment.[135] However many men
did feel guilt, disappointment and inadequacy, stating that they were simply
trying to provide an 'emotional rock' for their partners.[134]
***** Availability and utilisation[edit] *****
High costs keep IVF out of reach for many developing countries, but research by
the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claim to have found a
much lower cost methodology (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which
may be suitable for some fertility treatment.[136] Moreover, the laws of many
countries permit IVF for only single women, lesbian couples, and persons
participating in surrogacy arrangements.[137] Using PGD gives members of these
select demographic groups disproportionate access to a means of creating a
child possessing characteristics that they consider "ideal," raising issues of
equal opportunity for both the parents'/parent's and the child's generation.
Many fertile couples[citation_needed] now demand equal access to embryonic
screening so that their child can be just as healthy as one created through
IVF. Mass use of PGD, especially as a means of population_control or in the
presence of legal measures related to population or demographic control, can
lead to intentional or unintentional demographic effects such as the skewed
live-birth sex ratios seen in communist China following implementation of its
one-child_policy.
**** Australia[edit] ****
In Australia, the average age of women undergoing ART treatment is 35.5 years
among those using their own eggs (one in four being 40 or older) and 40.5 years
among those using donated_eggs.[138] While IVF is available in Australia,
Australians using IVF are unable to choose their baby's gender.[139]
**** Cameroon[edit] ****
Ernestine_Gwet_Bell supervised the first Cameroonian child born by IVF in 1998.
[140]
**** India[edit] ****
The penetration of the IVF market in India is quite low at present with only
2,800 cycles/million infertile women in the reproductive age group (20â44
years) as compared to China which has 6,500 cycles. The key challenges are lack
of awareness, affordability and accessibility.[141] India in 2018 becomes the
destination for Fertility Tourism because of most affordable IVF treatment
cost. IVF treatment cost in India varies from $2000 to $4000 (roughly between
150000/- INR to 250000/- INR including all aspects of IVF treatment with
medicines which is almost 5 times lower than IVF Cost in Western part of the
world.
**** Israel[edit] ****
Israel has the highest rate of IVF in the world, with 1657 procedures performed
per million people per year. Couples without children can receive funding for
IVF for up to two children. The same funding is available for women without
children who will raise up to 2 children in a single_parent home. IVF is
available for women aged 18 to 45.[142] The Israeli Health Ministry says it
spends roughly $3450 per procedure.
**** Sweden[edit] ****
One, two or three IVF treatments are government subsidised for women who are
younger than 40 and have no children. The rules for how many treatments are
subsidised, and the upper age limit for the women, vary between different
county_councils. [143] Single women are treated, and embryo adoption is
allowed. There are also private clinics that offer the treatment for a fee.
[144]
**** United Kingdom[edit] ****
Availability of IVF in England is determined by Clinical_commissioning_groups.
The National_Institute_for_Health_and_Care_Excellence (NICE) recommends up to 3
cycles of treatment for women under 40 years old with minimal success
conceiving after 2 years of unprotected sex. Cycles will not be continued for
women who are older than 40 years old. [145] CCGs in Essex, Bedfordshire and
Somerset have reduced funding to one cycle, or none, and it is expected that
reductions will become more widespread. Funding may be available in
"exceptional circumstances" â for example if a male partner has a
transmittable infection or one partner is affected by cancer treatment.
According to the campaign group Fertility Fairness at the end of 2014 every CCG
in England was funding at least one cycle of IVF".[146] Prices paid by the NHS
in England varied between under Â£3,000 to more than Â£6,000 in 2014/5.[147] In
February 2013, the cost of implementing the NICE guidelines for IVF along with
other treatments for infertility was projected to be Â£236,000 per year per
100,000 members of the population.[148]
IVF increasingly appears on NHS_treatments_blacklists.[149] In August 2017 five
of the 208 CCGs had stopped funding IVF completely and others were considering
doing so.[150] By October 2017 only 25 CCGs were delivering the three
recommended NHS IVF cycles to eligible women under 40.[151] Policies could fall
foul of discrimination_laws if they treat same sex couples differently from
heterosexual ones.[152]
The Human_Fertilisation_and_Embryology_Authority said in September 2018 that
parents who are limited to one cycle of IVF, or have to fund it themselves, are
more likely choose to implant multiple embryos in the hope it increases the
chances of pregnancy. This significantly increases the chance of multiple
births and the associated poor outcomes, which would increase NHS costs. The
president of the Royal_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynaecologists said that
funding 3 cycles was "the most important factor in maintaining low rates of
multiple pregnancies and reduce(s) associated complications".[153]
**** USA[edit] ****
In the United States, overall availability of IVF in 2005 was 2.5 IVF
physicians per 100,000 population, and utilisation was 236 IVF cycles per
100,000.[154] 126 procedures are performed per million people per year.
Utilisation highly increases with availability and IVF insurance coverage, and
to a significant extent also with percentage of single persons and median
income.[154] In the US, an average cycle, from egg retrieval to embryo
implantation, costs $12,400, and insurance companies that do cover treatment,
even partially, usually cap the number of cycles they pay for.[155] As of 2015,
more than 1 million babies had been born utilising IVF technologies.[26]
The cost of IVF rather reflects the costliness of the underlying healthcare
system than the regulatory or funding environment,[156] and ranges, on average
for a standard IVF cycle and in 2006 United States dollars, between $12,500 in
the United States to $4,000 in Japan.[156] In Ireland, IVF costs around
â¬4,000, with fertility drugs, if required, costing up to â¬3,000.[157] The
cost per live birth is highest in the United States ($41,000[156]) and United
Kingdom ($40,000[156]) and lowest in Scandinavia and Japan (both around $24,500
[156]).
Many fertility clinics in the United States limit the upper age at which women
are eligible for IVF to 50 or 55 years.[158] These cut-offs make it difficult
for women older than fifty-five to utilise the procedure.[158]
***** Legal status[edit] *****
Government agencies in China passed bans on the use of IVF in 2003 by unmarried
women or by couples with certain infectious diseases.[159]
In India, the use of IVF as a means of sex selection (preimplantation_genetic
diagnosis) is banned under the Pre-Conception_and_Pre-Natal_Diagnostic
Techniques_Act,_1994.[160][161][162]
Sunni Muslim nations generally allow IVF between married couples when conducted
with their own respective sperm and eggs, but not with donor eggs from other
couples. But Iran, which is Shi'a Muslim, has a more complex scheme. Iran bans
sperm donation but allows donation of both fertilised and unfertilised eggs.
Fertilised eggs are donated from married couples to other married couples,
while unfertilised eggs are donated in the context of mut'ah or temporary
marriage to the father.[163]
By 2012 Costa_Rica was the only country in the world with a complete ban on IVF
technology, it having been ruled unconstitutional by the nation's Supreme Court
because it "violated life."[164] Costa Rica had been the only country in the
western hemisphere that forbade IVF. A law project sent reluctantly by the
government of President Laura_Chinchilla was rejected by parliament. President
Chinchilla has not publicly stated her position on the question of IVF.
However, given the massive influence of the Catholic Church in her government
any change in the status quo seems very unlikely.[165][166] In spite of Costa
Rican government and strong religious opposition, the IVF ban has been struck
down by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in a decision of 20 December
2012.[167] The court said that a long-standing Costa Rican guarantee of
protection for every human embryo violated the reproductive freedom of
infertile couples because it prohibited them from using IVF, which often
involves the disposal of embryos not implanted in a patient's uterus.[168] On
10 September 2015, President Luis Guillermo SolÃ­s signed a decree legalising
in-vitro fertilisation. The decree was added to the country's official gazette
on 11 September. Opponents of the practice have since filed a lawsuit before
the country's Constitutional Court.[169]
All major restrictions on single but infertile women using IVF were lifted in
Australia in 2002 after a final appeal to the Australian High Court was
rejected on procedural grounds in the Leesa Meldrum case. A Victorian federal
court had ruled in 2000 that the existing ban on all single women and lesbians
using IVF constituted sex discrimination.[170] Victoria's government announced
changes to its IVF law in 2007 eliminating remaining restrictions on fertile
single women and lesbians, leaving South Australia as the only state
maintaining them.[171]
Federal regulations in the United States include screening requirements_and
restrictions on donations, but generally do not affect sexually intimate
partners.[172] However, doctors may be required to provide treatments due to
nondiscrimination laws, as for example in California.[109] The US state of
Tennessee proposed a bill in 2009 that would have defined donor IVF as
adoption.[173] During the same session another bill proposed barring adoption
from any unmarried and cohabitating couple, and activist groups stated that
passing the first bill would effectively stop unmarried people from using IVF.
[174][175] Neither of these bills passed.[176][177]
