Pollination is the transfer of pollen from a male part of a plant to a female
part of a plant, later enabling fertilisation and the production of seeds, most
often by an animal or by wind.[1] Pollinating agents are animals such as
insects, birds, and bats; water; wind; and even plants themselves, when self-
pollination occurs within a closed flower. Pollination often occurs within a
species. When pollination occurs between species it can produce hybrid
offspring in nature and in plant_breeding work.
In angiosperms, after the pollen grain has landed on the stigma, it develops a
pollen_tube which grows down the style until it reaches an ovary. Sperm cells
from the pollen grain then move along the pollen tube, enter an ovum cell
through the micropyle and fertilise it, resulting in the production of a seed.
A successful angiosperm pollen grain (gametophyte) containing the male gametes
is transported to the stigma, where it germinates and its pollen tube grows
down the style to the ovary. Its two gametes travel down the tube to where the
gametophyte(s) containing the female gametes are held within the carpel. One
nucleus fuses with the polar_bodies to produce the endosperm tissues, and the
other with the ovule to produce the embryo[2][3] Hence the term: "double
fertilization".
In gymnosperms, the ovule is not contained in a carpel, but exposed on the
surface of a dedicated support organ, such as the scale of a cone, so that the
penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary
according to the division of gymnosperms in question. Two main modes of
fertilization are found in gymnosperms. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm
that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and
gnetophytes have sperm that are unable to swim but are conveyed to the egg
along a pollen tube.
The study of pollination brings together many disciplines, such as botany,
horticulture, entomology, and ecology. The pollination process as an
interaction between flower and pollen_vector was first addressed in the 18th
century by Christian_Konrad_Sprengel. It is important in horticulture and
agriculture, because fruiting is dependent on fertilization: the result of
pollination. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.

***** Process[edit] *****
Pollen germination has three stages; hydration, activation and pollen tube
emergence. The pollen grain is severely dehydrated so that its mass is reduced
enabling it to be more easily transported from flower to flower. Germination
only takes place after rehydration, ensuring that premature germination does
not take place in the anther. Hydration allows the plasma membrane of the
pollen grain to reform into its normal bilayer organization providing an
effective osmotic membrane. Activation involves the development of actin
filaments throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, which eventually become
concentrated at the point from which the pollen tube will emerge. Hydration and
activation continue as the pollen tube begins to grow.[4]
In conifers, the reproductive structures are borne on cones. The cones are
either pollen cones (male) or ovulate cones (female), but some species are
monoecious and others dioecious. A pollen cone contains hundreds of
microsporangia carried on (or borne on) reproductive structures called
sporophylls. Spore mother cells in the microsporangia divide by meiosis to form
haploid microspores that develop further by two mitotic divisions into immature
male gametophytes (pollen grains). The four resulting cells consist of a large
tube cell that forms the pollen_tube, a generative cell that will produce two
sperm by mitosis, and two prothallial cells that degenerate. These cells
comprise a very reduced microgametophyte, that is contained within the
resistant wall of the pollen grain.[5][6]
The pollen grains are dispersed by the wind to the female, ovulate cone that is
made up of many overlapping scales (sporophylls, and thus megasporophylls),
each protecting two ovules, each of which consists of a megasporangium (the
nucellus) wrapped in two layers of tissue, the integument and the cupule, that
were derived from highly modified branches of ancestral gymnosperms. When a
pollen grain lands close enough to the tip of an ovule, it is drawn in through
the micropyle ( a pore in the integuments covering the tip of the ovule) often
by means of a drop of liquid known as a pollination drop. The pollen enters a
pollen chamber close to the nucellus, and there it may wait for a year before
it germinates and forms a pollen tube that grows through the wall of the
megasporangium (=nucellus) where fertilisation takes place. During this time,
the megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to form four haploid cells, three
of which degenerate. The surviving one develops as a megaspore and divides
repeatedly to form an immature female gametophyte (egg sac). Two or three
archegonia containing an egg then develop inside the gametophyte. Meanwhile, in
the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the
body cell of the male gametophyte. The pollen tube elongates and pierces and
grows through the megasporangium wall and delivers the sperm cells to the
female gametophyte inside. Fertilisation takes place when the nucleus of one of
the sperm cells enters the egg cell in the megagametophyteâs archegonium.[6]
In flowering plants, the anthers of the flower produce microspores by meiosis.
These undergo mitosis to form male gametophytes, each of which contains two
haploid cells. Meanwhile, the ovules produce megaspores by meiosis, further
division of these form the female gametophytes, which are very strongly
reduced, each consisting only of a few cells, one of which is the egg. When a
pollen grain adheres to the stigma of a carpel it germinates, developing a
pollen tube that grows through the tissues of the style, entering the ovule
through the micropyle. When the tube reaches the egg sac, two sperm cells pass
through it into the female gametophyte and fertilisation takes place.[5]
***** Methods[edit] *****
Pollination may be biotic or abiotic. Biotic pollination relies on living
pollinators to move the pollen from one flower to another. Abiotic pollination
relies on wind, water or even rain. About 80% of angiosperms rely on biotic
pollination.[7]
**** Abiotic[edit] ****
Abiotic pollination uses nonliving methods such as wind and water to move
pollen from one flower to another. This allows the plant to spend energy
directly on pollen rather than on attracting pollinators with flowers and
nectar.
*** By wind[edit] ***
Some 98% of abiotic pollination is anemophily, pollination by wind. This
probably arose from insect pollination, most likely due to changes in the
environment or the availability of pollinators.[8][9][10] The transfer of
pollen is more efficient than previously thought; wind pollinated plants have
developed to have specific heights, in addition to specific floral, stamen and
stigma positions that promote effective pollen dispersal and transfer.[11]
*** By water[edit] ***
Pollination by water, hydrophily, uses water to transport pollen, sometimes as
whole anthers; these can travel across the surface of the water to carry dry
pollen from one flower to another.[12] In Vallisneria_spiralis, an unopened
male flower floats to the surface of the water, and, upon reaching the surface,
opens up and the fertile anthers project forward. The female flower, also
floating, has its stigma protected from the water, while its sepals are
slightly depressed into the water, allowing the male flowers to tumble in.[12]
*** By rain[edit] ***
Rain pollination is used by a small percentage of plants. Heavy rain
discourages insect pollination and damages unprotected flowers, but can itself
disperse pollen of suitably adapted plants, such as Ranunculus_flammula,
Narthecium_ossifragum, and Caltha_palustris.[13] In these plants, excess rain
drains allowing the floating pollen to come in contact with the stigma.[13] In
rain pollination in orchids, the rain allows for the anther cap to be removed,
allowing for the pollen to be exposed. After exposure, raindrops causes the
pollen to be shot upward, when the stipe pulls them back, and then fall into
the cavity of the stigma. Thus, for the orchid Acampe_rigida, this allows the
plant to self-pollinate, which is useful when biotic pollinators in the
environment have decreased.[14]
*** Switching methods[edit] ***
It is possible for a plant have varying pollination methods, including both
biotic and abiotic pollination. The orchid Oeceoclades_maculata uses both rain
and butterflies, depending on its environmental conditions.[15]

Hummingbirds typically feed on red flowers
Main article: Pollinator
More commonly, pollination involves pollinators (also called pollen vectors):
organisms that carry or move the pollen grains from the anther of one flower to
the receptive part of the carpel or pistil (stigma) of another.[16] Between
100,000 and 200,000 species of animal act as pollinators of the world's 250,000
species of flowering plant.[17] The majority of these pollinators are insects,
but about 1,500 species of birds and mammals visit flowers and may transfer
pollen between them. Besides birds and bats which are the most frequent
visitors, these include monkeys, lemurs, squirrels, rodents and possums.[17]
Entomophily, pollination by insects, often occurs on plants that have developed
colored petals and a strong scent to attract insects such as, bees, wasps and
occasionally ants (Hymenoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), moths and butterflies
(Lepidoptera), and flies (Diptera). The existence of insect pollination dates
back to the dinosaur era.[18]
In zoophily, pollination is performed by vertebrates such as birds and bats,
particularly, hummingbirds, sunbirds, spiderhunters, honeyeaters, and fruit
bats. Ornithophily or bird pollination is the pollination of flowering plants
by birds. Chiropterophily or bat pollination is the pollination of flowering
plants by bats. Plants adapted to use bats or moths as pollinators typically
have white petals, strong scent and flower at night, whereas plants that use
birds as pollinators tend to produce copious nectar and have red petals.[19]
Insect pollinators such as honey_bees (Apis spp.),[20] bumblebees (Bombus
spp.),[21][22] and butterflies (e.g., Thymelicus flavus)[23] have been observed
to engage in flower_constancy, which means they are more likely to transfer
pollen to other conspecific plants.[24][25] This can be beneficial for the
pollinators, as flower constancy prevents the loss of pollen during
interspecific flights and pollinators from clogging stigmas with pollen of
other flower species. It also improves the probability that the pollinator will
find productive flowers easily accessible and recognisable by familiar clues.
[26]
Some flowers have specialized mechanisms to trap_pollinators to increase
effectiveness.[27] Other flowers will attract pollinators by odor. For example,
bee species such as Euglossa_cordata are attracted to orchids this way, and it
has been suggested that the bees will become intoxicated during these visits to
the orchid flowers, which last up to 90 minutes.[28] However, in general,
plants that rely on pollen vectors tend to be adapted to their particular type
of vector, for example day-pollinated species tend to be brightly coloured, but
if they are pollinated largely by birds or specialist mammals, they tend to be
larger and have larger nectar rewards than species that are strictly insect-
pollinated. They also tend to spread their rewards over longer periods, having
long flowering seasons; their specialist pollinators would be likely to starve
if the pollination season were too short.[27]
As for the types of pollinators, reptile pollinators are known, but they form a
minority in most ecological situations. They are most frequent and most
ecologically significant in island systems, where insect and sometimes also
bird populations may be unstable and less species-rich. Adaptation to a lack of
animal food and of predation pressure, might therefore favour reptiles becoming
more herbivorous and more inclined to feed on pollen and nectar.[29] Most
species of lizards in the families that seem to be significant in pollination
seem to carry pollen only incidentally, especially the larger species such as
Varanidae and Iguanidae, but especially several species of the Gekkonidae are
active pollinators, and so is at least one species of the Lacertidae, Podarcis
lilfordi, which pollinates various species, but in particular is the major
pollinator of Euphorbia_dendroides on various Mediterranean islands.[30]
Mammals are not generally thought of as pollinators, but some rodents, bats and
marsupials are significant pollinators and some even specialise in such
activities. In South Africa certain species of Protea (in particular Protea
humiflora, P. amplexicaulis, P. subulifolia, P. decurrens and P. cordata) are
adapted to pollination by rodents (particularly Cape_Spiny_Mouse, Acomys
subspinosus)[31] and elephant_shrews (Elephantulus species).[32] The flowers
are borne near the ground, are yeasty smelling, not colourful, and sunbirds
reject the nectar with its high xylose content. The mice apparently can digest
the xylose and they eat large quantities of the pollen.[33] In Australia
pollination by flying, gliding and earthbound mammals has been demonstrated.
[34] Examples of pollen vectors include many species of wasps, that transport
pollen of many plant species, being potential or even efficient pollinators.

Pollination can be accomplished by cross-pollination or by self-pollination:
    * Cross-pollination, also called allogamy, occurs when pollen is delivered
      from the stamen of one flower to the stigma of a flower on another plant
      of the same species.[5] Plants adapted for cross-pollination have several
      mechanisms to prevent self-pollination; the reproductive organs may be
      arranged in such a way that self-fertilisation is unlikely, or the
      stamens and carpels may mature at different times.[5]
    * Self-pollination occurs when pollen from one flower pollinates the same
      flower or other flowers of the same individual.[36] It is thought to have
      evolved under conditions when pollinators were not reliable vectors for
      pollen transport, and is most often seen in short-lived annual species
      and plants that colonize new locations.[37] Self-pollination may include
      autogamy, where pollen is transferred to the female part of the same
      flower; or geitonogamy, when pollen is transferred to another flower on
      the same plant.[38] Plants adapted to self-fertilize often have similar
      stamen and carpel lengths. Plants that can pollinate themselves and
      produce viable offspring are called self-fertile. Plants that cannot
      fertilize themselves are called self-sterile, a condition which mandates
      cross-pollination for the production of offspring.[38]
    * Cleistogamy: is self-pollination that occurs before the flower opens. The
      pollen is released from the anther within the flower or the pollen on the
      anther grows a tube down the style to the ovules. It is a type of sexual
      breeding, in contrast to asexual systems such as apomixis. Some
      cleistogamous flowers never open, in contrast to chasmogamous flowers
      that open and are then pollinated. Cleistogamous flowers are by necessity
      found on self-compatible or self-fertile plants.[39] Although certain
      orchids and grasses are entirely cleistogamous, other plants resort to
      this strategy under adverse conditions. Often there may be a mixture of
      both cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers, sometimes on different parts
      of the plant and sometimes in mixed inflorescences. The ground_bean
      produces cleistogamous flowers below ground, and mixed cleistogamous and
      chasmogamous flowers above.[40]
    * Geranium incanum, like most geraniums and pelargoniums, sheds its
      anthers, sometimes its stamens as well, as a barrier to self-pollination.
      This young flower is about to open its anthers, but has not yet fully
      developed its pistil.
    * These Geranium incanum flowers have opened their anthers, but not yet
      their stigmas. Note the change of colour that signals to pollinators that
      it is ready for visits.
    * This Geranium incanum flower has shed its stamens, and deployed the tips
      of its pistil without accepting pollen from its own anthers. (It might of
      course still receive pollen from younger flowers on the same plant.)
An estimated 48.7% of plant species are either dioecious or self-incompatible
obligate out-crossers.[41] It is also estimated that about 42% of flowering
plants have a mixed mating system in nature.[42] In the most common kind of
mixed mating system, individual plants produce a single type of flower and
fruits may contain self-pollinated, out-crossed or a mixture of progeny types.
Pollination also requires consideration of pollenizers, the plants that serve
as the pollen source for other plants. Some plants are self-compatible (self-
fertile) and can pollinate and fertilize themselves. Other plants have chemical
or physical barriers to self-pollination.
In agriculture and horticulture pollination management, a good pollenizer is a
plant that provides compatible, viable and plentiful pollen and blooms at the
same time as the plant that is to be pollinated or has pollen that can be
stored and used when needed to pollinate the desired flowers. Hybridization is
effective pollination between flowers of different species, or between
different breeding lines or populations. see also Heterosis.
Peaches are considered self-fertile because a commercial crop can be produced
without cross-pollination, though cross-pollination usually gives a better
crop. Apples are considered self-incompatible, because a commercial crop must
be cross-pollinated. Many commercial fruit tree varieties are grafted clones,
genetically identical. An orchard block of apples of one variety is genetically
a single plant. Many growers now consider this a mistake. One means of
correcting this mistake is to graft a limb of an appropriate pollenizer
(generally a variety of crabapple) every six trees or so.[citation_needed]

***** Coevolution[edit] *****
Main article: Pollination_syndrome
Melittosphex_burmensis, the oldest bee fossil, from the Cretaceous
The first fossil record for abiotic pollination is from fern-like plants in the
late Carboniferous period. Gymnosperms show evidence for biotic pollination as
early as the Triassic period. Many fossilized pollen grains show
characteristics similar to the biotically dispersed pollen today. Furthermore,
the gut contents, wing structures, and mouthpart morphology of fossilized
beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators. The association
between beetles and angiosperms during the early Cretaceous period led to
parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects into the late Cretaceous. The
evolution of nectaries in late Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the
mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms.
Bees provide a good example of the mutualism that exists between hymenopterans
and angiosperms. Flowers provide bees with nectar (an energy source) and pollen
(a source of protein). When bees go from flower to flower collecting pollen
they are also depositing pollen grains onto the flowers, thus pollinating them.
While pollen and nectar, in most cases, are the most notable reward attained
from flowers, bees also visit flowers for other resources such as oil,
fragrance, resin and even waxes.[43] It has been estimated that bees originated
with the origin or diversification of angiosperms.[44] In addition, cases of
coevolution between bee species and flowering plants have been illustrated by
specialized adaptations. For example, long legs are selected for in Rediviva
neliana, a bee that collects oil from Diascia capsularis, which have long spur
lengths that are selected for in order to deposit pollen on the oil-collecting
bee, which in turn selects for even longer legs in R. neliana and again longer
spur length in D. capsularis is selected for, thus, continually driving each
other's evolution.[45]

Pollination_management is a branch of agriculture that seeks to protect and
enhance present pollinators and often involves the culture and addition of
pollinators in monoculture situations, such as commercial fruit orchards. The
largest managed pollination event in the world is in Californian almond
orchards, where nearly half (about one million hives) of the US honey_bees are
trucked to the almond orchards each spring. New_York's apple crop requires
about 30,000 hives; Maine's blueberry crop uses about 50,000 hives each year.
The US solution to the pollinator shortage, so far, has been for commercial
beekeepers to become pollination contractors and to migrate. Just as the
combine_harvesters follow the wheat harvest from Texas to Manitoba, beekeepers
follow the bloom from south to north, to provide pollination for many different
crops.[citation_needed]
In America, bees are brought to commercial plantings of cucumbers, squash,
melons, strawberries, and many other crops. Honey bees are not the only managed
pollinators: a few other species of bees are also raised as pollinators. The
alfalfa_leafcutter_bee is an important pollinator for alfalfa seed in western
United States and Canada. Bumblebees are increasingly raised and used
extensively for greenhouse tomatoes and other crops.
The ecological and financial importance of natural pollination by insects to
agricultural crops, improving their quality and quantity, becomes more and more
appreciated and has given rise to new financial opportunities. The vicinity of
a forest or wild grasslands with native pollinators near agricultural crops,
such as apples, almonds or coffee can improve their yield by about 20%. The
benefits of native pollinators may result in forest owners demanding payment
for their contribution in the improved crop results â a simple example of the
economic value of ecological services. Farmers can also raise native crops in
order to promote native bee pollinator species as shown with L._vierecki in
Delaware[47] and L._leucozonium in southwest Virginia.[48]
The American_Institute_of_Biological_Sciences reports that native insect
pollination saves the United States agricultural economy nearly an estimated
$3.1 billion annually through natural crop production;[49] pollination produces
some $40 billion worth of products annually in the United States alone.[50]
Pollination of food crops has become an environmental_issue, due to two trends.
The trend to monoculture means that greater concentrations of pollinators are
needed at bloom time than ever before, yet the area is forage poor or even
deadly to bees for the rest of the season. The other trend is the decline_of
pollinator_populations, due to pesticide misuse and overuse, new diseases and
parasites of bees, clearcut_logging, decline of beekeeping, suburban
development, removal of hedges and other habitat from farms, and public concern
about bees. Widespread aerial_spraying for mosquitoes due to West_Nile fears is
causing an acceleration of the loss of pollinators.
In some situations, farmers or horticulturists may aim to restrict natural
pollination to only permit breeding with the preferred individuals plants. This
may be achieved through the use of pollination_bags.
**** Improving pollination in areas with suboptimal bee densities[edit] ****
In some instances growersâ demand for beehives far exceeds the available
supply. The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from
close to 6 million after WWII, to less than 2.5 million today. In contrast, the
area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% in the same
time period. Additionally, in the past five years there has been a decline in
winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate of colony
losses at near 30%.[51][52][53][54] At present, there is an enormous demand for
beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the
agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into
cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the
flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honey bees and increasing their
foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase
grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings. ISCA Technologies,[55]
from Riverside California, created a semiochemical formulation called SPLAT
Bloom, that modifies the behavior of honey bees, inciting them to visit flowers
in every portion of the field.
***** Environmental impacts[edit] *****
Loss of pollinators, also known as Pollinator_decline (of which colony_collapse
disorder is perhaps the most well known) has been noticed in recent years.
These loss of pollinators have caused a disturbance in early plant regeneration
processes such as seed dispersal and of course, pollination. Early processes of
plant regeneration greatly depend on plant-animal interactions and because
these interactions are interrupted, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are
threatened.[56] Pollination by animals aids in the genetic variability and
diversity within plants because it allows for out-crossing instead for self-
crossing. Without this genetic diversity there would be a lack of traits for
natural selection to act on for the survival of the plant species. Seed
dispersal is also important for plant fitness because it allows plants the
ability to expand their populations. More than that, it permits plants to
escape environments that have changed and have become difficult to reside in.
All of these factors show the importance of pollinators for plants, which are
the foundation for a stable ecosystem. If only a few species of plants depended
on pollinators the overall effect would not be as devastating however, this is
not the case. It is known that more than 87.5% of angiosperms, over 75% of
tropical tree species, and 30-40% of tree species in temperate regions depend
on pollination and seed dispersal.[56]
Possible explanations for pollinator decline include habitat_destruction,
pesticide, parasitism/diseases, and climate_change.[57] It has also been found
that the more destructive forms of human disturbances are land use changes such
as fragmentation, selective logging, and the conversion to secondary forest
habitat.[56] Defaunation of frugivores has also been found to be an important
driver.[58] These alterations are especially harmful due to the sensitivity of
the pollination process of plants.[56] There was a study done on tropical palms
and the researchers concluded that defaunation has caused a decline in seed
dispersal, which causes a decrease in genetic variability in this species.[58]
Habitat destruction such as fragmentation and selective logging remove area
that are most optimal for the different types of pollinators, which removes
pollinators food resources, nesting sites, and leads to isolation of
populations.[59] The effect of pesticides on pollinators has been debated due
to the difficulty to be confident that a single pesticide is the cause and not
a mixture or other threats.[59] It is also not know if exposure alone causes
damages, or if the duration and potency are also factors.[59] However,
insecticides do have some negative effects, such as neonicotinoids that harm
bee colonies. Many researchers believe it is the synergistic effects of these
factors which are ultimately detrimental to pollinator populations.[57]
**** Examples of affected pollinators[edit] ****
The most known and understood pollinator, bees, have been used as the prime
example of the decline in pollinators. Bees are essential in the pollination of
agricultural crops and wild plants and are one of the main insects that perform
this task.[60] Out of the bees species, the honey bee or Apis_mellifera has
been studied the most and in the United States, there has been a loss of 59% of
colonies from 1947 to 2005.[60] The decrease in populations of the honey bee
have been attributed to pesticides, genetically modified crops, fragmentation,
parasites and diseases that have been introduced.[61] There has been a focus on
neonicotinoids effects on honey bee populations. Neonicotinoids insecticides
have been used due to its low mammalian toxicity, target specificity, low
application rates, and broad spectrum activity. However, the insecticides are
able to make its way throughout the plant, which includes the pollen and
nectar. Due to this, it has been shown to effect on the nervous system and
colony relations in the honey bee populations.[61]
Butterflies too have suffered due to these modifications. Butterflies are
helpful ecological indicators since they are sensitive to changes within the
environment like the season, altitude, and above all, human impact on the
environment. Butterfly populations were higher within the natural forest and
were lower in open land. The reason for the difference in density is the fact
that in open land the butterflies would be exposed to desiccation and
predation. These open regions are caused by habitat destruction like logging
for timber, livestock grazing, and firewood collection. Due to this
destruction, butterfly species' diversity can decrease and it is known that
there is a correlation in butterfly diversity and plant diversity.[62]
**** Food security and pollinator decline[edit] ****
Besides the imbalance of the ecosystem caused by the decline in pollinators, it
may jeopardise food security. Pollination is necessary for plants to continue
their populations and 3/4 of the world's food supply are plants that require
pollinators.[63] Insect pollinators, like bees, are large contributors to crop
production, over 200 billion dollars worth of crop species are pollinated by
these insects.[59] Pollinators are also essential because they improve crop
quality and increase genetic diversity, which is necessary in producing fruit
with nutritional value and various flavors.[64] Crops that do not depend on
animals for pollination but on the wind or self-pollination, like corn and
potatoes, have doubled in production and make up a large part of the human diet
but do not provide the micronutrients that are needed.[65] The essential
nutrients that are necessary in the human diet are present in plants that rely
on animal pollinators.[65] There have been issues in vitamin and mineral
deficiencies and it is believed that if pollinator populations continue to
decrease these deficiencies will become even more prominent.[64]
***** The structure of plantâpollinator networks[edit] *****
Wild pollinators often visit a large number of plant species and plants are
visited by a large number of pollinator species. All these relations together
form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising
similarities were found in the structure of networks consisting out of the
interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure was found to be
similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of
entirely different species.[66]
The structure of plant-pollinator networks may have large consequences for the
way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions.
Mathematical models, examining the consequences of this network structure for
the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which
plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between
pollinators[67] and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between
pollinators when conditions are harsh.[68] This means that pollinator species
together can survive under harsh conditions. But it also means that pollinator
species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This
simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other
when surviving under difficult conditions.[68]
Such a community-wide collapse, involving many pollinator species, can occur
suddenly when increasingly harsh conditions pass a critical point and recovery
from such a collapse might not be easy. The improvement in conditions needed
for pollinators to recover, could be substantially larger than the improvement
needed to return to conditions at which the pollinator community collapsed.[68]
