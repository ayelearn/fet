****** History of plant systematics ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The Vienna_Dioscurides manuscript of De_Materia_Medica, from the early sixth
century, is one of the oldest herbals in existence. Dioscorides wrote the book
between 50 and 60 AD.
The history of plant systematics—the biological_classification of
plants—stretches from the work of ancient Greek to modern evolutionary
biologists. As a field of science, plant systematics came into being only
slowly, early plant lore usually being treated as part of the study of
medicine. Later, classification and description was driven by natural_history
and natural_theology. Until the advent of the_theory_of_evolution, nearly all
classification was based on the scala_naturae. The professionalization of
botany in the 18th and 19th century marked a shift toward more holistic
classification methods, eventually based on evolutionary relationships.

***** Antiquity[edit] *****
The Sushrut (800-1000 BC) (Indian Scholar of ayurveda) first classify plant in
4 categories on basis of flowering pattern structure and life span. (1)

The peripatetic_philosopher Theophrastus (372â287 BC), as a student of
Aristotle in Ancient_Greece, wrote Historia_Plantarum, the earliest surviving
treatise on plants, where he listed the names of over 500 plant species.[1] He
did not articulate a formal classification scheme, but relied on the common
groupings of folk_taxonomy combined with growth form: tree shrub; undershrub;
or herb.
The De_Materia_Medica of Dioscorides was an important early compendium of plant
descriptions (over five hundred), classifying plants chiefly by their medicinal
effects; it was in use from its publication in the 1st century until the 16th
century, making it the major herbal throughout the Middle Ages.[2][3]
***** Early modern period[edit] *****
In the 16th century, works by Otto_Brunfels, Hieronymus_Bock, and Leonhart
Fuchs helped to revive interest in natural history based on first-hand
observation; Bock in particular included environmental and life cycle
information in his descriptions. With the influx of exotic species in the Age
of_Exploration, the number of known species expanded rapidly, but most authors
were far more interested in the medicinal properties of individual plants than
an overarching classification system. Later influential Renaissance books
include those of Caspar_Bauhin and Andrea_Cesalpino. Bauhin described over 6000
plants, which he arranged into 12 books and 72 sections based on a wide range
of common characteristics. Cesalpino based his system on the structure of the
organs of fructification, using the Aristotelian technique of logical_division.
[2]
In the late 17th century, the most influential classification schemes were
those of English botanist and natural theologian John_Ray and French botanist
Joseph_Pitton_de_Tournefort. Ray, who listed over 18,000 plant species in his
works, is credited with establishing the monocot/dicot division and some of his
groups â mustards, mints, legumes and grasses â stand today (though under
modern family names). Tournefort used an artificial system based on logical
division which was widely adopted in France and elsewhere in Europe up until
Linnaeus.[2]
The book that had an enormous accelerating effect on the science of plant
systematics was Species_Plantarum (1753) by Linnaeus. It presented a complete
list of the plant species then known to Europe,[1] ordered for the purpose of
easy identification using the number and arrangement of the male and female
sexual organs of the plants. Of the groups in this book, the highest rank that
continues to be used today is the genus. The consistent use of binomial
nomenclature along with a complete listing of all plants provided a huge
stimulus for the field.
Although meticulous, the classification of Linnaeus served merely as an
identification manual; it was based on phenetics and did not regard
evolutionary relationships among species.[1] It assumed that plant species were
given by God and that what remained for humans was to recognise them and use
them (a Christian reformulation of the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being).
Linnaeus was quite aware that the arrangement of species in the Species
Plantarum was not a natural system, i.e. did not express relationships. However
he did present some ideas of plant relationships elsewhere.
***** Modern and Contemporary periods[edit] *****
Significant contributions to plant classification came from de_Jussieu
(inspired by the work of Adanson) in 1789 and the early nineteenth century saw
the start of work by de Candolle, culminating in the Prodromus.
A major influence on plant systematics was the theory of evolution (Charles
Darwin published Origin_of_Species in 1859), resulting in the aim to group
plants by their phylogenetic relationships. To this was added the interest in
plant_anatomy, aided by the use of the light_microscope and the rise of
chemistry, allowing the analysis of secondary_metabolites.
Currently, the strict use of epithets in botany, although regulated by
international codes, is considered unpractical and outdated. The very notion of
species, the fundamental classification unit, is often up to subjective
intuition and thus can not be well defined. As a result, estimate of the total
number of existing "species" (ranging from 2 million to 100 million) becomes a
matter of preference.[1]
While scientists have agreed for some time that a functional and objective
classification system must reflect actual evolutionary processes and genetic
relationships, the technological means for creating such a system did not exist
until recently. In the 1990s DNA technology saw immense progress, resulting in
unprecedented accumulation of DNA_sequence_data from various genes present in
compartments of plant cells. In 1998 a ground-breaking classification of the
angiosperms (the APG_system) consolidated molecular_phylogenetics (and
especially cladistics or phylogenetic systematics) as the best available
method. For the first time relatedness could be measured in real terms, namely
similarity of the molecules comprising the genetic code.[1]
