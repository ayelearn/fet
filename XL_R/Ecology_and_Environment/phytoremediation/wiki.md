Phytoremediation /ËfaÉªtÉÊrÉªËmiËdÉªËeÉªÊÉn/ (from Ancient_Greek
ÏÏÏÏ(phyto), meaning 'plant', and Latin remedium, meaning 'restoring
balance') refers to the technologies that use living plants to clean up soil,
air, and water contaminated with hazardous contaminants.[1] It is defined as
"the use of green plants and the associated microorganisms, along with proper
soil amendments and agronomic techniques to either contain, remove or render
toxic environmental contaminants harmless".[2]
Phytoremediation is a cost-effective plant-based approach of remediation that
takes advantage of the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds
from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissues. It
refers to the natural ability of certain plants called hyperaccumulators to
bioaccumulate, degrade, or render harmless contaminants in soils, water, or
air. Toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants are the major targets for
phytoremediation. Knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of
phytoremediation began to emerge in recent years together with biological and
engineering strategies designed to optimize and improve phytoremediation. In
addition, several field trials confirmed the feasibility of using plants for
environmental_cleanup.[3]

***** Application[edit] *****
Phytoremediation may be applied wherever the soil or static water environment
has become polluted or is suffering ongoing chronic pollution. Examples where
phytoremediation has been used successfully include the restoration of
abandoned metal mine workings, and sites where polychlorinated_biphenyls have
been dumped during manufacture and mitigation of ongoing coal mine discharges
reducing the impact of contaminants in soils, water, or air. Contaminants such
as metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives,[4] and crude oil and its
derivatives, have been mitigated in phytoremediation projects worldwide. Many
plants such as mustard_plants, alpine_pennycress, hemp, and pigweed have proven
to be successful at hyperaccumulating contaminants at toxic_waste sites.
Not all plants are able to accumulate heavy metals or organics pollutants due
to differences in the physiology of the plant.[5] Even cultivars within the
same species have varying abilities to accumulate pollutants.[5]
Over the past 20 years, this technology has become increasingly popular and has
been employed at sites with soils contaminated with lead, uranium, and arsenic.
While it has the advantage that environmental concerns may be treated in situ,
one major disadvantage of phytoremediation is that it requires a long-term
commitment, as the process is dependent on a plant's ability to grow and thrive
in an environment that is not ideal for normal plant growth.
***** Advantages and limitations[edit] *****
    * Advantages:
          o the cost of the phytoremediation is lower than that of traditional
            processes both in situ and ex situ
          o the plants can be easily monitored
          o the possibility of the recovery and re-use of valuable metals (by
            companies specializing in "phyto mining")
          o it is potentially the least harmful method because it uses
            naturally occurring organisms and preserves the environment in a
            more natural state.
          o it preserves the topsoil, maintaining the fertility of the soil[6]
          o Increase soil_health, yield, and plant phytochemicals [7]
          o the use of plants also reduces erosion and metal leaching in the
            soil[6]
    * Limitations:
          o phytoremediation is limited to the surface area and depth occupied
            by the roots.
          o slow growth and low biomass require a long-term commitment
          o with plant-based systems of remediation, it is not possible to
            completely prevent the leaching of contaminants into the
            groundwater (without the complete removal of the contaminated
            ground, which in itself does not resolve the problem of
            contamination)
          o the survival of the plants is affected by the toxicity of the
            contaminated land and the general condition of the soil.
          o bio-accumulation of contaminants, especially metals, into the
            plants which then pass into the food_chain, from primary level
            consumers upwards or requires the safe disposal of the affected
            plant material.
          o when taking up heavy metals, sometimes the metal is bound to the
            soil_organic_matter, which makes it unavailable for the plant to
            extract[citation_needed]
***** Case studies[edit] *****
**** Heavy metal remediation with Ficus microcarpa Field Scale Experiment[edit]
****
Phytoremediation of efficiency of metal by Ficus_microcarpa was evaluated
through a real scale experiment.[8] The root biomass production of the species
varied significantly from 3.68 to 5.43 g because of the spatial heterogeneity
of different metals. According to the study it could take 4â93 years to
purify excess Cd on the experimental site. Mercury was unable to be
premeditated by F. microcarpa. The species of plant was moved to unpolluted
soil. When transplanted Cd and CU were transferred to the rhizosphere soil. Pb
and Hg were not released.[8]
**** Kaltag School oil seep (Alaska)[edit] ****
The Alaska_Department_of_Environmental_Conservation (ADEC) has been monitoring
fuel oil spills at the Kaltag School in Kaltag, Alaska, since 1991. The
community has been working with ADEC to use a phytoremediation plan drafted by
scientists at the University_of_Alaska_Fairbanks. The ADEC continues to keep
the public informed of the progress on their website.[9]
***** Processes[edit] *****
Phytoremediation process
A range of processes mediated by plants or algae are useful in treating
environmental problems:
**** Phytoextraction[edit] ****
See also: Phytoextraction_process
Some heavy metals such as copper and zinc are removed from the soil by moving
up into the plant roots.
Phytoextraction (or phytoaccumulation or phytosequestration) uses plants or
algae to remove contaminants from soil or water into harvestable plant biomass.
The roots take up substances from the soil or water and concentrate it above
ground in the plant biomass[6] Organisms that can uptake extremely high amounts
of contaminants from the soil are called hyperaccumulators.[10] Phytoextraction
can also be performed by plants (e.g. Populus and Salix) that take up lower
levels of pollutants, but due to their high growth rate and biomass production,
may remove a considerable amount of contaminants from the soil.[11]
Phytoextraction has been growing rapidly in popularity worldwide for the last
twenty years or so. Typically, phytoextraction is used for heavy metals or
other inorganics.[12] At the time of disposal, contaminants are typically
concentrated in the much smaller volume of the plant matter than in the
initially contaminated soil or sediment. After harvest, a lower level of the
contaminant will remain in the soil, so the growth/harvest cycle must usually
be repeated through several crops to achieve a significant cleanup. After the
process, the cleaned soil can support other vegetation. Mining of these
extracted metals through phytomining, is also being experimented with as a way
of recovering the material.[citation_needed] Hyperaccumulators are plants that
can naturally take up the contaminants in soil unassisted. In many cases these
are metallophyte plants that can tolerate and incorporate high levels of toxic
metals. Induced or assisted phytoextraction is a process where a conditioning
fluid containing a chelator or another agent is added to soil to increase metal
solubility or mobilization so that the plants can absorb them more easily.[13]
While this leads to increased metal uptake by plants, it can also lead to large
amounts of available metals in the soil beyond what the plants are able to
translocate, causing potential leaching into the subsoil or groundwater.[13]
Examples of plants that are known to accumulate the following contaminants:
    * Arsenic, using the sunflower (Helianthus_annuus),[14] or the Chinese
      Brake fern (Pteris_vittata).[15]
    * Cadmium, using willow (Salix_viminalis): In 1999, one research experiment
      performed by Maria Greger and Tommy Landberg suggested willow has a
      significant potential as a phytoextractor of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and
      copper (Cu), as willow has some specific characteristics like high
      transport capacity of heavy metals from root to shoot and huge amount of
      biomass production; can be used also for production of bio energy in the
      biomass energy power plant.[16]
    * Cadmium and zinc, using alpine pennycress (Thlaspi_caerulescens), a
      hyperaccumulator of these metals at levels that would be toxic to many
      plants. On the other hand, the presence of copper seems to impair its
      growth (see table for reference).
    * Lead, using Indian mustard (Brassica_juncea), ragweed (Ambrosia
      artemisiifolia), hemp dogbane (Apocynum_cannabinum), or poplar_trees,
      which sequester lead in their biomass.
    * Salt-tolerant (moderately halophytic) barley and/or sugar_beets are
      commonly used for the extraction of sodium_chloride (common salt) to
      reclaim fields that were previously flooded by sea_water.
    * Caesium-137 and strontium-90 were removed from a pond using sunflowers
      after the Chernobyl_accident.[17]
    * Mercury, selenium and organic pollutants such as polychlorinated
      biphenyls (PCBs) have been removed from soils by transgenic_plants
      containing genes for bacterial enzymes.[18]

**** Phytostabilization[edit] ****
Phytostabilization reduces the mobility of substances in the environment, for
example, by limiting the leaching of substances from the soil.[5] It focuses on
the long term stabilization and containment of the pollutant. The plant
immobilizes the pollutants by binding them to soil particles making them less
available for plant or human uptake.[citation_needed] Unlike phytoextraction,
phytostabilization focuses mainly on sequestering pollutants in soil near the
roots but not in plant tissues. Pollutants become less bioavailable, resulting
in reduced exposure. The plants can also excrete a substance that produces a
chemical reaction, converting the heavy metal pollutant into a less toxic form.
[6] Stabilization results in reduced erosion, runoff, leaching, in addition to
reducing the bioavailability of the contaminant.[12] An example application of
phytostabilization is using a vegetative cap to stabilize and contain mine
tailings.[19]
**** Phytodegradation[edit] ****
The roots secrete enzymes that degrade (breakdown) organic pollutants in the
soil.
Phytodegradation (also called phytotransformation) uses plants or
microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants in the soil or within the body of
the plant. The organic compounds are broken down by enzymes that the plant
roots secrete and these molecules are then taken up by the plant and released
through transpiration.[20] This process works best with organic contaminants
like herbicides, trichloroethylene, and methyl_tert-butyl_ether.[12]
Phytotransformation results in the chemical modification of environmental
substances as a direct result of plant metabolism, often resulting in their
inactivation, degradation (phytodegradation), or immobilization
(phytostabilization). In the case of organic pollutants, such as pesticides,
explosives, solvents, industrial chemicals, and other xenobiotic substances,
certain plants, such as Cannas, render these substances non-toxic by their
metabolism.[21] In other cases, microorganisms living in association with plant
roots may metabolize these substances in soil or water. These complex and
recalcitrant compounds cannot be broken down to basic molecules (water, carbon-
dioxide, etc.) by plant molecules, and, hence, the term phytotransformation
represents a change in chemical structure without complete breakdown of the
compound. The term "Green Liver" is used to describe phytotransformation,[22]
as plants behave analogously to the human liver when dealing with these
xenobiotic compounds (foreign compound/pollutant).[23][24] After uptake of the
xenobiotics, plant enzymes increase the polarity of the xenobiotics by adding
functional groups such as hydroxyl groups (-OH).
This is known as Phase I metabolism, similar to the way that the human liver
increases the polarity of drugs and foreign compounds (drug_metabolism).
Whereas in the human liver enzymes such as cytochrome_P450s are responsible for
the initial reactions, in plants enzymes such as peroxidases, phenoloxidases,
esterases and nitroreductases carry out the same role.[21]
In the second stage of phytotransformation, known as Phase II metabolism, plant
biomolecules such as glucose and amino acids are added to the polarized
xenobiotic to further increase the polarity (known as conjugation). This is
again similar to the processes occurring in the human liver where
glucuronidation (addition of glucose molecules by the UGT class of enzymes,
e.g. UGT1A1) and glutathione addition reactions occur on reactive centres of
the xenobiotic.
Phase I and II reactions serve to increase the polarity and reduce the toxicity
of the compounds, although many exceptions to the rule are seen. The increased
polarity also allows for easy transport of the xenobiotic along aqueous
channels.
In the final stage of phytotransformation (Phase III metabolism), a
sequestration of the xenobiotic occurs within the plant. The xenobiotics
polymerize in a lignin-like manner and develop a complex structure that is
sequestered in the plant. This ensures that the xenobiotic is safely stored,
and does not affect the functioning of the plant. However, preliminary studies
have shown that these plants can be toxic to small animals (such as snails),
and, hence, plants involved in phytotransformation may need to be maintained in
a closed enclosure.
Hence, the plants reduce toxicity (with exceptions) and sequester the
xenobiotics in phytotransformation. Trinitrotoluene phytotransformation has
been extensively researched and a transformation pathway has been proposed.[25]
**** Phytostimulation[edit] ****
Phytostimulation (or rhizodegradation) is the enhancement of soil_microbial
activity for the degradation of organic contaminants, typically by organisms
that associate with roots.[20] This process occurs within the rhizosphere,
which is the layer of soil that surrounds the roots.[20] Plants release
carbohydrates and acids that stimulate microorganism activity which results in
the biodegradation of the organic contaminants.[26] This means that the
microorganisms are able to digest and break down the toxic substances into
harmless form.[20] Phytostimulation has been shown to be effective in degrading
petroleum hydrocarbons, PCBs, and PAHs.[12] Phytostimulation can also involve
aquatic plants supporting active populations of microbial degraders, as in the
stimulation of atrazine degradation by hornwort.[27]
**** Phytovolatilization[edit] ****
Contaminates are then broken down and the fragments are then subsequently
transformed and volatilized into the atmosphere.
Phytovolatilization is the removal of substances from soil or water with
release into the air, sometimes as a result of phytotransformation to more
volatile and/or less polluting substances. In this process, contaminants are
taken up by the plant and through transpiration, evaporate into the atmosphere.
[20] This is the most studied form of phytovolatilization, where volatilization
occurs at the stem and leaves of the plant, however indirect
phytovolatilization occurs when contaminants are volatilized from the root
zone.[28] Selenium (Se) and Mercury (Hg) are often removed from soil through
phytovolatilization.[5] Poplar trees are one of the most successful plants for
removing VOCs through this process due to its high transpiration rate.[12]
**** Rhizofiltration[edit] ****
Rhizofiltration is a process that filters water through a mass of roots to
remove toxic substances or excess nutrients. The pollutants remain absorbed in
or adsorbed to the roots.[20] This process is often used to clean up
contaminated groundwater through planting directly in the contaminated site or
through removing the contaminated water and providing it to these plants in an
off-site location.[20] In either case though, typically plants are first grown
in a greenhouse under precise conditions.[29]
**** Biological hydraulic containment[edit] ****
Biological hydraulic_containment occurs when some plants, like poplars, draw
water upwards through the soil into the roots and out through the plant, which
decreases the movement of soluble contaminants downwards, deeper into the site
and into the groundwater.[30]
**** Phytodesalination[edit] ****
Phytodesalination uses halophytes (plants adapted to saline soil) to extract
salt from the soil to improve its fertility[6]
***** Role of genetics[edit] *****
Breeding programs and genetic_engineering are powerful methods for enhancing
natural phytoremediation capabilities, or for introducing new capabilities into
plants. Genes for phytoremediation may originate from a micro-organism or may
be transferred from one plant to another variety better adapted to the
environmental conditions at the cleanup site. For example, genes encoding a
nitroreductase from a bacterium were inserted into tobacco and showed faster
removal of TNT and enhanced resistance to the toxic effects of TNT.[31]
Researchers have also discovered a mechanism in plants that allows them to grow
even when the pollution concentration in the soil is lethal for non-treated
plants. Some natural, biodegradable compounds, such as exogenous polyamines,
allow the plants to tolerate concentrations of pollutants 500 times higher than
untreated plants, and to absorb more pollutants.
***** Hyperaccumulators and biotic interactions[edit] *****
A plant is said to be a hyperaccumulator if it can concentrate the pollutants
in a minimum percentage which varies according to the pollutant involved (for
example: more than 1000 mg/kg of dry weight for nickel, copper, cobalt,
chromium or lead; or more than 10,000 mg/kg for zinc or manganese).[32] This
capacity for accumulation is due to hypertolerance, or phytotolerance: the
result of adaptative evolution from the plants to hostile environments through
many generations. A number of interactions may be affected by metal
hyperaccumulation, including protection, interferences with neighbour plants of
different species, mutualism (including mycorrhizae, pollen and seed
dispersal), commensalism, and biofilm.

***** Phytoscreening[edit] *****
As plants are able to translocate and accumulate particular types of
contaminants, plants can be used as biosensors of subsurface contamination,
thereby allowing investigators to quickly delineate contaminant plumes.[33][34]
Chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene, have been observed in tree
trunks at concentrations related to groundwater concentrations.[35] To ease
field implementation of phytoscreening, standard methods have been developed to
extract a section of the tree trunk for later laboratory analysis, often by
using an increment_borer.[36] Phytoscreening may lead to more optimized site
investigations and reduce contaminated site cleanup costs.
