Field concerned with the safety, health, and welfare of people at work
This painting depicts a woman examining her work on a lathe at a factory in
Britain during World War II. Her eyes are not protected. Today, such practice
would not be permitted in most industrialized countries that adhere to
occupational health and safety standards for workers. In many countries,
however, such standards are still either weak or nonexistent.

Occupational safety and health (OSH), also commonly referred to as occupational
health and safety (OHS), occupational health,[1] or workplace health and safety
(WHS), is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the safety, health, and
welfare of people at work. These terms also refer to the goals of this field,
[2] so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of
occupational safety and health program/department etc.
The goals of occupational safety and health programs include to foster a safe
and healthy work environment.[3] OSH may also protect co-workers, family
members, employers, customers, and many others who might be affected by the
workplace environment. In the United States, the term occupational health and
safety is referred to as occupational health and occupational and non-
occupational safety and includes safety for activities outside of work.[4]
In common-law jurisdictions, employers have a common law duty to take
reasonable care of the safety of their employees.[5] Statute law may in
addition impose other general duties, introduce specific duties, and create
government bodies with powers to regulate workplace safety issues: details of
this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

***** Definition[edit] *****
As defined by the World_Health_Organization (WHO) "occupational health deals
with all aspects of health and safety in the workplace and has a strong focus
on primary prevention of hazards."[6] Health has been defined as "a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of
disease or infirmity."[7] Occupational health is a multidisciplinary field of
healthcare concerned with enabling an individual to undertake their occupation,
in the way that causes least harm to their health. Health has been defined as
It contrasts, for example, with the promotion of health and safety at work,
which is concerned with preventing harm from any incidental hazards, arising in
the workplace.
Since 1950, the International_Labour_Organization (ILO) and the World_Health
Organization (WHO) have shared a common definition of occupational health. It
was adopted by the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health at its first
session in 1950 and revised at its twelfth session in 1995. The definition
reads:
     The main focus in occupational health is on three different
     objectives: (i) the maintenance and promotion of workersâ health
     and working capacity; (ii) the improvement of working environment and
     work to become conducive to safety and health and (iii) development
     of work organizations and working cultures in a direction which
     supports health and safety at work and in doing so also promotes a
     positive social climate and smooth operation and may enhance
     productivity of the undertakings. The concept of working culture is
     intended in this context to mean a reflection of the essential value
     systems adopted by the undertaking concerned. Such a culture is
     reflected in practice in the managerial systems, personnel policy,
     principles for participation, training policies and quality
     management of the undertaking.
     â Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health[8]
Those in the field of occupational health come from a wide range of disciplines
and professions including medicine, psychology, epidemiology, physiotherapy and
rehabilitation, occupational_therapy, occupational_medicine, human_factors_and
ergonomics, and many others. Professionals advise on a broad range of
occupational health matters. These include how to avoid particular pre-existing
conditions causing a problem in the occupation, correct posture for the work,
frequency of rest breaks, preventative action that can be undertaken, and so
forth.
"Occupational health should aim at: the promotion and maintenance of the
highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all
occupations; the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by
their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from
risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the placing and maintenance of
the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and
psychological capabilities; and, to summarize, the adaptation of work to man
and of each man to his job.
***** History[edit] *****
Harry McShane, age 16, 1908. Pulled into machinery in a factory in Cincinnati
and had his arm ripped off at the shoulder and his leg broken without any
compensation.
The research and regulation of occupational safety and health are a relatively
recent phenomenon. As labor_movements arose in response to worker concerns in
the wake of the industrial revolution, worker's health entered consideration as
a labor-related issue.
In the United_Kingdom, the Factory_Acts of the early nineteenth century (from
1802 onwards) arose out of concerns about the poor health of children working
in cotton mills: the Act of 1833 created a dedicated professional Factory
Inspectorate.[9] :41 The initial remit of the Inspectorate was to police
restrictions on the working hours in the textile industry of children and young
persons (introduced to prevent chronic overwork, identified as leading directly
to ill-health and deformation, and indirectly to a high accident rate).
However, on the urging of the Factory Inspectorate, a further Act in 1844
giving similar restrictions on working hours for women in the textile industry
introduced a requirement for machinery guarding (but only in the textile
industry, and only in areas that might be accessed by women or children).[9] :
85
In 1840 a Royal_Commission published its findings on the state of conditions
for the workers of the mining industry that documented the appallingly
dangerous environment that they had to work in and the high frequency of
accidents. The commission sparked public outrage which resulted in the Mines
Act of 1842. The act set up an inspectorate for mines and collieries which
resulted in many prosecutions and safety improvements, and by 1850, inspectors
were able to enter and inspect premises at their discretion.[10]
Otto_von_Bismarck inaugurated the first social insurance legislation in 1883
and the first worker's_compensation law in 1884 â the first of their kind in
the Western world. Similar acts followed in other countries, partly in response
to labor unrest.[11]
***** Workplace hazards[edit] *****
Main article: Occupational_hazard
Although work provides many economic and other benefits, a wide array of
workplace hazards also present risks to the health and safety of people at
work. These include but are not limited to, "chemicals, biological agents,
physical factors, adverse ergonomic conditions, allergens, a complex network of
safety risks," and a broad range of psychosocial risk factors.[12] Personal
protective_equipment can help protect against many of these hazards.[13]
Physical_hazards affect many people in the workplace. Occupational hearing loss
is the most common work-related injury in the United States, with 22 million
workers exposed to hazardous noise levels at work and an estimated $242 million
spent annually on worker's compensation for hearing loss disability.[14] Falls
are also a common cause of occupational injuries and fatalities, especially in
construction, extraction, transportation, healthcare, and building cleaning and
maintenance.[15] Machines have moving parts, sharp edges, hot surfaces and
other hazards with the potential to crush, burn, cut, shear, stab or otherwise
strike or wound workers if used unsafely.[16]
Biological_hazards (biohazards) include infectious microorganisms such as
viruses and toxins produced by those organisms such as anthrax. Biohazards
affect workers in many industries; influenza, for example, affects a broad
population of workers.[17] Outdoor workers, including farmers, landscapers, and
construction workers, risk exposure to numerous biohazards, including animal
bites and stings,[18][19][20] urushiol from poisonous plants,[21] and diseases
transmitted through animals such as the West Nile virus and Lyme disease.[22]
[23] Health care workers, including veterinary_health workers, risk exposure to
blood-borne_pathogens and various infectious diseases,[24][25] especially those
that are emerging.[26]
Dangerous chemicals can pose a chemical_hazard in the workplace. There are many
classifications of hazardous chemicals, including neurotoxins, immune agents,
dermatologic agents, carcinogens, reproductive toxins, systemic toxins,
asthmagens, pneumoconiotic agents, and sensitizers.[27] Authorities such as
regulatory agencies set occupational_exposure_limits to mitigate the risk of
chemical hazards.[28] An international effort is investigating the health
effects of mixtures of chemicals. There is some evidence that certain chemicals
are harmful at lower levels when mixed with one or more other chemicals. This
may be particularly important in causing cancer.[29]
Psychosocial_hazards include risks to the mental and emotional well-being of
workers, such as feelings of job insecurity, long work hours, and poor work-
life balance.[30] A recent Cochrane_review - using moderate quality evidence -
related that the addition of work-directed interventions for depressed workers
receiving clinical interventions reduces the number of lost work days as
compared to clinical interventions alone.[31] This review also demonstrated
that the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy to primary or occupational
care and the addition of a "structured telephone outreach and care management
program" to usual care are both effective at reducing sick leave days.[31]
***** By industry[edit] *****
Specific occupational safety and health risk factors vary depending on the
specific sector and industry. Construction workers might be particularly at
risk of falls, for instance, whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of
drowning. The United States Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics identifies the fishing,
aviation, lumber, metalworking, agriculture, mining and transportation
industries as among some of the more dangerous for workers.[32] Similarly
psychosocial risks such as workplace_violence are more pronounced for certain
occupational groups such as health care employees, police, correctional
officers and teachers.[33]
**** Construction[edit] ****
See also: Construction_site_safety
Workplace safety notices at the entrance of a Chinese construction site.
Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring
more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United_States
and in the European_Union.[34][35] In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate
among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for
all workers.[34] Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal
injuries among construction workers.[34] Proper safety equipment such as
harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting
scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction
industry.[36] Due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences
for employees as well as organizations, it is of utmost importance to ensure
health and safety of workers and compliance with HSE construction requirements.
Health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules
and regulations. For example, the role of the Construction Design Management
(CDM) Coordinator as a requirement has been aimed at improving health and
safety on-site.[37]
The 2010 National_Health_Interview_Survey_Occupational_Health_Supplement (NHIS-
OHS) identified work organization factors and occupational psychosocial and
chemical/physical exposures which may increase some health risks. Among all
U.S. workers in the construction sector, 44% had non-standard work arrangements
(were not regular permanent employees) compared to 19% of all U.S. workers, 15%
had temporary employment compared to 7% of all U.S. workers, and 55%
experienced job insecurity compared to 32% of all U.S. workers. Prevalence
rates for exposure to physical/chemical hazards were especially high for the
construction sector. Among nonsmoking workers, 24% of construction workers were
exposed to secondhand smoke while only 10% of all U.S. workers were exposed.
Other physical/chemical hazards with high prevalence rates in the construction
industry were frequently working outdoors (73%) and frequent exposure to
vapors, gas, dust, or fumes (51%).[38]
**** Agriculture[edit] ****
Main article: Agricultural_safety_and_health
Rollover_protection_bar on a Fordson tractor.
Agriculture workers are often at risk of work-related injuries, lung disease,
noise-induced hearing loss, skin disease, as well as certain cancers related to
chemical use or prolonged sun exposure. On industrialized_farms, injuries
frequently involve the use of agricultural_machinery. The most common cause of
fatal agricultural injuries in the United States is tractor rollovers, which
can be prevented by the use of roll_over_protection_structures which limit the
risk of injury in case a tractor rolls over.[39] Pesticides and other chemicals
used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health,[40] and workers exposed
to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects.[41] As an industry in
which families, including children, commonly work alongside their families,
agriculture is a common source of occupational injuries and illnesses among
younger workers.[42] Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker
include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.[43]
The 2010 NHIS-OHS found elevated prevalence rates of several occupational
exposures in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector which may negatively
impact health. These workers often worked long hours. The prevalence rate of
working more than 48 hours a week among workers employed in these industries
was 37%, and 24% worked more than 60 hours a week.[44] Of all workers in these
industries, 85% frequently worked outdoors compared to 25% of all U.S. workers.
Additionally, 53% were frequently exposed to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes,
compared to 25% of all U.S. workers.[45]
**** Service sector[edit] ****
See also: Service_sector
As the number of service_sector jobs has risen in developed countries, more and
more jobs have become sedentary, presenting a different array of health
problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary_sector.
Contemporary problems such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating
to occupational_stress, workplace_bullying, and overwork in many countries have
further complicated the interaction between work and health.
According to data from the 2010 NHIS-OHS, hazardous physical/chemical exposures
in the service sector were lower than national averages. On the other hand,
potentially harmful work organization characteristics and psychosocial
workplace exposures were relatively common in this sector. Among all workers in
the service industry, 30% experienced job insecurity in 2010, 27% worked non-
standard shifts (not a regular day shift), 21% had non-standard work
arrangements (were not regular permanent employees).[46]
Due to the manual labour involved and on a per employee basis, the US Postal
Service, UPS and FedEx are the 4th, 5th and 7th most dangerous companies to
work for in the US.[47]
**** Mining and oil & gas extraction[edit] ****
See also: Mine_safety
According to data from the 2010 NHIS-OHS, workers employed in mining and oil
and gas extraction industries had high prevalence rates of exposure to
potentially harmful work organization characteristics and hazardous chemicals.
Many of these workers worked long hours: 50% worked more than 48 hours a week
and 25% worked more than 60 hours a week in 2010. Additionally, 42% worked non-
standard shifts (not a regular day shift). These workers also had high
prevalence of exposure to physical/chemical hazards. In 2010, 39% had frequent
skin contact with chemicals. Among nonsmoking workers, 28% of those in mining
and oil and gas extraction industries had frequent exposure to secondhand_smoke
at work. About two-thirds were frequently exposed to vapors, gas, dust, or
fumes at work.[48]
**** Healthcare and social assistance[edit] ****
See also: Health_care and Welfare
Beekeepers often wear protective clothing, for OHS reasons
Healthcare workers are exposed to many hazards that can adversely affect their
health and well-being. Long hours, changing shifts, physically demanding tasks,
violence, and exposures to infectious diseases and harmful chemicals are
examples of hazards that put these workers at risk for illness and injury.
According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, U.S. hospitals recorded 253,700
work-related injuries and illnesses in 2011, which is 6.8 work-related injuries
and illnesses for every 100 full-time employees.[49] The injury and illness
rate in hospitals is higher than the rates in construction and manufacturing
â two industries that are traditionally thought to be relatively hazardous.

Number of occupational fatal work injuries in the U.S. from 1992 until 2014.
Note, 2001 statistics do not include death related to the September 11
terrorist attacks.
The Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics of the United_States_Department_of_Labor
compiles information about workplace fatalities and non-fatal injuries in the
United_States. In 1970, an estimated 14,000 workers were killed on the job â
by 2010, the workforce had doubled, but workplace deaths were down to about
4,500.[50]
Between 1913 and 2013, workplace fatalities dropped by approximately 80%.[51]
The Bureau also compiles information about the most dangerous jobs. According
to the census of occupational injuries 4,679 people died on the job in 2014.
[52] In 2015, a decline in nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses was
observed, with private industry employers reporting approximately 2.9 million
incidents, nearly 48,000 fewer cases than in 2014.[53] The Bureau also uses
tools like www.AgInjuryNews.org[54] to identify and compile additional sources
of fatality reports for their datasets.[55][56]

**** European Union[edit] ****
In most countries males comprise the vast majority of workplace fatalities. In
the EU as a whole, 94% of death were of males.[61] In the UK the disparity was
even greater with males comprising 97.4% of workplace deaths. In the UK there
were 171 fatal injuries at work in financial year 2011â2012, compared with
651 in calendar year 1974; the fatal injury rate declined over that period from
2.9 fatalities per 100,000 workers to 0.6 per 100,000 workers[62]

One of the decisions taken by Communists during the reign of Stalin was the
reduction in the number of accidents and occupational diseases to zero.[63] The
tendency to decline remained in the RF in the early 21st century, and the same
methods of falsification are used, so that the real occupational morbidity and
the number of accidents are unknown.[64]
After the destruction of the USSR, the enterprises became owned by new_owners
who were not interested in preserving the life and health of workers. They did
not spend money on equipment modernization, and the share of harmful workplaces
increased.[65] The state did not interfere in this, and sometimes it helped
employers.[citation_needed] At first, the process of growth was slow - due to
the fact that in the 1990s this was compensated by mass de-industrialization
(factories with foundries and other harmful types of production were closed).
[citation_needed] In the 2000s, this method of restraining the growth of the
share of harmful workplaces was exhausted. Therefore, in 2010s the Ministry_of
Labor adopted the Federal law 426-FZ, which equated the issuance of personal
protective_equipment to the employee to real improvement of working conditions;
and the Ministry_of_Health made significant changes in the methods of risk
assessment in the workplace.[66] This explains the "decline" in the proportion
of workers working in harmful conditions after 2014 - it happened not in
practice, but only on paper.[citation_needed]

According to prof. Oleg Rusak, three state bodies cannot count the number of
people killed in accidents at workplaces. According to Rostrud, it was revealed
2074 hidden accidents at work. Employers were hidden 64 group accidents and 404
deaths, 1332 severe accidents (2008).

***** Management systems[edit] *****
**** National[edit] ****
National management system standards for occupational health and safety include
AS/NZS 4801-2001 for Australia and New Zealand, CAN/CSA-Z1000-14 for Canada and
ANSI/ASSE Z10-2012 for the United States.[67][68] Association_FranÃ§aise_de
Normalisation_(AFNOR) in France also developed occupational safety and health
management standards.[69] In the United Kingdom, non-departmental public body
Health_and_Safety_Executive published Managing for health and safety (MFHS), an
online guidance.[70] In Germany, the state factory inspectorates of Bavaria and
Saxony had introduced the management system OHRIS. In the Netherlands, the
management system Safety Certificate Contractors combines management of
occupational health and safety and the environment.
**** International[edit] ****
ISO_45001 was published in March 2018.
Previously, the International_Labour_Organization (ILO) published ILO-OSH 2001,
also titled "Guidelines on occupational safety and health management systems"
to assist organizations with introducing OSH management systems.[71] These
guidelines encourage continual improvement in employee health and safety,
achieved via a constant process of policy, organization, planning &
implementation, evaluation, and action for improvement, all supported by
constant auditing to determine the success of OSH actions.[71] From 1999 to
2018, the occupational health and safety management system standard OHSAS_18001
was adopted as a British and Polish standard and widely used internationally.
OHSAS 18000 comprised two parts, OHSAS 18001 and 18002 and was developed by a
selection of leading trade bodies, international standards and certification
bodies to address a gap where no third-party certifiable international standard
existed.[citation_needed] It was intended to integrate with ISO 9001 and ISO
14001.[72]
***** National legislation and public organizations[edit] *****
Main article: List_of_occupational_safety_and_health_agencies
Occupational safety and health practice vary among nations with different
approaches to legislation, regulation, enforcement, and incentives for
compliance. In the EU, for example, some member states promote OSH by providing
public monies as subsidies, grants or financing, while others have created tax
system incentives for OSH investments. A third group of EU member states has
experimented with using workplace accident insurance premium discounts for
companies or organisations with strong OSH records.[73]
**** Australia[edit] ****
In Australia, the Commonwealth, four of the six states and both territories
have enacted and administer harmonised Work Health and Safety Legislation in
accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational
Reform in Occupational Health and Safety.[74] Each of these jurisdictions has
enacted Work Health & Safety legislation and regulations based on the
Commonwealth Work Health and Safety Act 2011 and common Codes of Practice
developed by Safe_Work_Australia.[75] Some jurisdictions have also included
mine safety under the model approach, however, most have retained separate
legislation for the time being. Western Australia intends to adopt a moderated
version of the model approach and Victoria has retained its own regime,
although the Model WHS laws themselves drew heavily on the Victoria approach.
**** Canada[edit] ****
In Canada, workers are covered by provincial or federal labour codes depending
on the sector in which they work. Workers covered by federal legislation
(including those in mining, transportation, and federal employment) are covered
by the Canada Labour Code; all other workers are covered by the health and
safety legislation of the province in which they work. The Canadian_Centre_for
Occupational_Health_and_Safety (CCOHS), an agency of the Government of Canada,
was created in 1966 by an Act of Parliament. The act was based on the belief
that all Canadians had "...a fundamental right to a healthy and safe working
environment." CCOHS is mandated to promote safe and healthy workplaces to help
prevent work-related injuries and illnesses. The CCOHS maintains a useful
(partial) list of OSH regulations for Canada and its provinces.[76]

In the European_Union, member_states have enforcing authorities to ensure that
the basic legal requirements relating to occupational health and safety are
met. In many EU countries, there is strong cooperation between employer and
worker organisations (e.g. unions) to ensure good OSH performance as it is
recognized this has benefits for both the worker (through maintenance of
health) and the enterprise (through improved productivity and quality). In
1996, the European_Agency_for_Safety_and_Health_at_Work was founded.
Member states of the European_Union have all transposed into their national
legislation a series of directives that establish minimum standards on
occupational health and safety. These directives (of which there are about 20
on a variety of topics) follow a similar structure requiring the employer to
assess the workplace risks and put in place preventive measures based on a
hierarchy_of_control. This hierarchy starts with elimination of the hazard and
ends with personal_protective_equipment.
However, certain EU member states admit to having lacking quality control in
occupational safety services, to situations in which risk analysis takes place
without any on-site workplace visits and to insufficient implementation of
certain EU OSH directives. Based on this, it is hardly surprising that the
total societal costs of work-related health problems and accidents vary from
2.6% to 3.8% of GNP between the EU member states.[78]
*** Denmark[edit] ***
In Denmark, occupational safety and health is regulated by the Danish Act on
Working Environment and cooperation at the workplace.[79] The Danish Working
Environment Authority carries out inspections of companies, draws up more
detailed rules on health and safety at work and provides information on health
and safety at work.[80] The result of each inspection is made public on the web
pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority so that the general public,
current and prospective employees, customers and other stakeholders can inform
themselves about whether a given organization has passed the inspection, should
they wish to do so.[81]
*** Spain[edit] ***
In Spain, occupational safety and health is regulated by the Spanish Act on
Prevention of Labour Risks. The Ministry of Employment and Social Security is
the authority responsible for issues relating to labour environment.[82] The
National Institute for Labour Safety and Hygiene is the technical public
Organization specialized in occupational safety and health.[83]
*** Sweden[edit] ***
In Sweden, occupational safety and health is regulated by the Work_Environment
Act. The Swedish_Work_Environment_Authority is the government_agency
responsible for issues relating to the working environment. The agency should
work to disseminate information and furnish advice on OSH, has a mandate to
carry out inspections, and a right to issue stipulations and injunctions to any
non-compliant employer.[84]
*** United Kingdom[edit] ***
In the UK, health and safety legislation is drawn up and enforced by the Health
and_Safety_Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health
and_Safety_at_Work_etc._Act_1974[85][86] (HASAWA). HASAWA introduced (section
2) a general duty on an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably
practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; with
the intention of giving a legal framework supporting 'codes of practice' not in
themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what
was reasonably practicable (deviations from them could be justified by
appropriate risk assessment). The previous reliance on detailed prescriptive
rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to
technological change, leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or
inappropriately regulated.[87][88] HSE has continued to make some regulations
giving absolute duties (where something must be done with no 'reasonable
practicability' test) but in the UK the regulatory trend is away from
prescriptive rules, and towards 'goal setting' and risk assessment. Recent
major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace
the concept of risk assessment. The other key aspect of the UK legislation is a
statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected health and safety
representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar
approach in Scandinavia, and that approach has since been adopted in Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia, for example.
For the UK, the government organisation dealing with occupational health has
been the Employment_Medical_Advisory_Service but in 2014 a new occupational
health organisation - the Health_and_Work_Service - was created to provide
advice and assistance to employers in order to get back to work employees on
long-term sick-leave.[89] The service, funded by government, will offer medical
assessments and treatment plans, on a voluntary basis, to people on long-term
absence from their employer; in return, the government will no longer foot the
bill for Statutory_Sick_Pay provided by the employer to the individual.
**** India[edit] ****
In India, the Labour Ministry formulates national policies on occupational
safety and health in factories and docks with advice and assistance from
Directorate General of Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI),
and enforces its Policies through inspectorates of factories and inspectorates
of dock safety.[90] DGFASLI is the technical arm of the Ministry of Labour &
Employment, Government of India and advises the factories on various problems
concerning safety, health, efficiency and well - being of the persons at work
places.[90] The DGFASLI provides technical support in formulating rules,
conducting occupational safety surveys and also for conducting occupational
safety training programs.[91]
**** Indonesia[edit] ****
In Indonesia, the Ministry_of_Manpower is responsible to ensure the safety,
health and welfare of workers while working, in a factory, or even the area
surrounding the factory where labourers work. There are a few rules that
control the safety of workers, for example Occupational Safety Act 1970 or
Occupational Health Act 1992.[92] The sanctions, however, are still low and the
violations of these laws are still at a high rate - with a maximum of 15
million rupiahs fine and/or a maximum of 1 year in prison.[93]
**** Malaysia[edit] ****
In Malaysia, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) under the
Ministry of Human Resource is responsible to ensure that the safety, health and
welfare of workers in both the public and private sector is upheld. DOSH is
responsible to enforce the Factories and Machinery Act 1967 and the
Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Act_1994.
**** People's Republic of China[edit] ****
Hardware stores in China specializing in safety equipment
In the People's_Republic_of_China, the Ministry of Health is responsible for
occupational disease prevention and the State Administration of Work Safety for
safety issues at work. On the provincial and municipal level, there are Health
Supervisions for occupational health and local bureaus of Work Safety for
safety. The "Occupational Disease Control Act of PRC" came into force on May 1,
2002.[94] and Work safety Act of PRC on November 1, 2002.[95] The Occupational
Disease Control Act is under revision. The prevention of occupational disease
is still in its initial stage compared with industrialised countries such as
the US or UK.
**** Singapore[edit] ****
In Singapore, the Ministry_of_Manpower operates various checks and campaigns
against unsafe work practices, such as when working at height, operating cranes
and in traffic management. Examples include Operation Cormorant and the Falls
Prevention Campaign.[96]
**** South Africa[edit] ****
In South_Africa the Department of Labour is responsible for occupational health
and safety inspection and enforcement in commerce and industry apart from
mining and energy production, where the Department of Mineral Resources is
responsible.
The main statutory legislation on Health and Safety in the jurisdiction of the
Department of Labour is Act No. 85 of 1993: Occupational Health and Safety Act
as amended by Occupational Health and Safety Amendment Act, No. 181 Of 1993.
Regulations to the OHS Act include:
    * General Administrative Regulations, 2003[97]
    * Certificate of Competency Regulations, 1990[98]
    * Construction Regulations, 2014
    * Diving Regulations 2009[99]
    * Driven Machinery Regulations, 1988[100]
    * Environmental Regulations for Workplaces, 1987[101]
    * General Machinery regulations, 1988[102]
    * General Safety Regulations, 1986[103]
    * Noise induced hearing loss regulations, 2003[104]
    * Pressure Equipment Regulations, 2004
**** Taiwan[edit] ****
In Taiwan, the Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration of the Ministry_of
Labor is in charge of occupational safety and health.[105] The matter is
governed under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.[106]
2007, official release the document TOSHMS ([[Taiwan Occupational Safety and
Health Management System]]), which defined the basic rule about occupational
safety standard.[107]
**** United Arab Emirates[edit] ****
OSHAD was introduced in February 2010 to regulate the implementation of
occupational health and safety in the emirates of Abu Dhabi.[108]
**** United States[edit] ****
In the United_States, President Richard_Nixon signed the Occupational_Safety
and_Health_Act into law on December 29, 1970. The act created the three
agencies that administer it. They include the Occupational_Safety_and_Health
Administration, National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health, and the
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.[109] The act authorized the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to regulate private
employers in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories.[110] The
Act establishing it includes a general_duty_clause (29 U.S.C. Â§ 654, 5(a))
requiring an employer to comply with the Act and regulations derived from it,
and to provide employees with "employment and a place of employment which are
free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or
serious physical harm to his employees."
OSHA was established in 1971 under the Department of Labor. It has headquarters
in Washington, DC and ten regional offices, further broken down into districts,
each organized into three sections; compliance, training, and assistance. Its
stated mission is to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working
men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training,
outreach, education and assistance.[111] The original plan was for OSHA to
oversee 50 state plans with OSHA funding 50% of each plan. Unfortunately it has
not worked out that way. There are currently 26 approved state plans (4 cover
only public employees)[50] and no other states want to participate. OSHA
manages the plan in the states not participating.[50]
OSHA develops safety standards in the Code of Federal Regulation and enforces
those safety standards through compliance inspections conducted by Compliance
Officers; enforcement resources are focussed on high-hazard industries.
Worksites may apply to enter OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP); a
successful application leads to an on-site inspection; if this is passed the
site gains VPP status and OSHA no longer inspect it annually nor (normally)
visit it unless there is a fatal accident or an employee complaint until VPP
revalidation (after 3â5 years)[50](VPP sites have injury and illness rates
less than half the average for their industry).
It has 73 specialists in local offices to provide tailored information and
training to employers and employees at little or no cost[4] Similarly OSHA
produces a range of publications, provides advice to employers and funds
consultation services available for small businesses.
OSHA's Alliance Program enables groups committed to worker safety and health to
work with it to develop compliance assistance tools and resources, share
information with workers and employers, and educate them about their rights and
responsibilities. OSHA also has a Strategic Partnership Program that zeros in
on specific hazards or specific geographic areas.[50] OSHA manages Susan B.
Harwood grants to nonprofit companies to train workers and employers to
recognize, avoid, and prevent safety and health hazards in the workplace.
Grants focus on small business, hard-to-reach workers and high-hazard
industries.
The National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health, created under the
same act, works closely with OSHA and provides the research behind many of
OSHA's regulations and standards.[112]
***** Professional roles and responsibilities[edit] *****
The roles and responsibilities of OSH professionals vary regionally, but may
include evaluating working environments, developing, endorsing and encouraging
measures that might prevent injuries and illnesses, providing OSH information
to employers, employees, and the public, providing medical examinations, and
assessing the success of worker health programs.
**** Europe[edit] ****
In Norway, the main required tasks of an occupational health and safety
practitioner include the following:
    * Systematic evaluations of the working environment
    * Endorsing preventative measures which eliminate causes of illnesses in
      the workplace
    * Providing information on the subject of employeesâ health
    * Providing information on occupational hygiene, ergonomics, and
      environmental and safety risks in the workplace[113]
In the Netherlands, the required tasks for health and safety staff are only
summarily defined and include the following:
    * Providing voluntary medical examinations
    * Providing a consulting room on the work environment to the workers
    * Providing health assessments (if needed for the job concerned)[114]
âThe main influence of the Dutch law on the job of the safety professional is
through the requirement on each employer to use the services of a certified
working conditions service to advise them on health and safetyâ.[114] A
âcertified serviceâ must employ sufficient numbers of four types of
certified experts to cover the risks in the organisations which use the
service:
    * A safety professional
    * An occupational hygienist
    * An occupational physician
    * A work and organisation specialist.[114]
In 2004, 37% of health and safety practitioners in Norway and 14% in the
Netherlands had an MSc; 44% had a BSc in Norway and 63% in the Netherlands; and
19% had training as an OSH technician in Norway and 23% in the Netherlands.
[114]
**** US[edit] ****
Leather craftsman gloves, safety goggles, and a properly fitted hardhat are
crucial for proper safety in a construction environment.
The main tasks undertaken by the OHS practitioner in the US include:
    * Develop processes, procedures, criteria, requirements, and methods to
      attain the best possible management of the hazards and exposures that can
      cause injury to people, and damage property, or the environment;
    * Apply good business practices and economic principles for efficient use
      of resources to add to the importance of the safety processes;
    * Promote other members of the company to contribute by exchanging ideas
      and other different approaches to make sure that every one in the
      corporation possess OHS knowledge and have functional roles in the
      development and execution of safety procedures;
    * Assess services, outcomes, methods, equipment, workstations, and
      procedures by using qualitative and quantitative methods to recognise the
      hazards and measure the related risks;
    * Examine all possibilities, effectiveness, reliability, and expenditure to
      attain the best results for the company concerned[115]
Knowledge required by the OHS professional in the US include:
    * Constitutional and case law controlling safety, health, and the
      environment
    * Operational procedures to plan/develop safe work practices
    * Safety, health and environmental sciences
    * Design of hazard control systems (i.e. fall protection, scaffoldings)
    * Design of recordkeeping systems that take collection into account, as
      well as storage, interpretation, and dissemination
    * Mathematics and statistics
    * Processes and systems for attaining safety through design[116]
Some skills required by the OHS professional in the US include (but are not
limited to):
    * Understanding and relating to systems, policies and rules
    * Holding checks and having control methods for possible hazardous
      exposures
    * Mathematical and statistical analysis
    * Examining manufacturing hazards
    * Planning safe work practices for systems, facilities, and equipment
    * Understanding and using safety, health, and environmental science
      information for the improvement of procedures
    * Interpersonal communication skills[116]
***** Differences between countries and regions[edit] *****
Because different countries take different approaches to ensuring occupational
safety and health, areas of OSH need and focus also vary between countries and
regions. Similar to the findings of the ENHSPO survey conducted in Australia,
the Institute of Occupational Medicine in the UK found that there is a need to
put greater emphasis on work-related illness in the UK.[117] In contrast, in
Australia and the US, a major responsibility of the OHS professional is to keep
company directors and managers aware of the issues that they face in regards to
occupational health and safety principles and legislation. However, in some
other areas of Europe, it is precisely this which has been lacking: âNearly
half of senior managers and company directors do not have an up-to-date
understanding of their health and safety-related duties and
responsibilities.â[118]
***** Identifying safety and health hazards[edit] *****
**** Hazards, risks, outcomes[edit] ****
The terminology used in OSH varies between countries, but generally speaking:
    * A hazard is something that can cause harm if not controlled.
    * The outcome is the harm that results from an uncontrolled hazard.
    * A risk is a combination of the probability that a particular outcome will
      occur and the severity of the harm involved.[119]
âHazardâ, âriskâ, and âoutcomeâ are used in other fields to
describe e.g. environmental damage, or damage to equipment. However, in the
context of OSH, âharmâ generally describes the direct or indirect
degradation, temporary or permanent, of the physical, mental, or social well-
being of workers. For example, repetitively carrying out manual_handling of
heavy objects is a hazard. The outcome could be a musculoskeletal_disorder
(MSD) or an acute back or joint injury. The risk can be expressed numerically
(e.g. a 0.5 or 50/50 chance of the outcome occurring during a year), in
relative terms (e.g. "high/medium/low"), or with a multi-dimensional
classification scheme (e.g. situation-specific risks).[citation_needed]
**** Hazard identification[edit] ****
Hazard identification or assessment is an important step in the overall risk
assessment and risk management process. It is where individual work hazards are
identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of
the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social
expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls
more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic
program of prevention. Hazard based programs also have the advantage of not
assigning or implying there are "acceptable risks" in the workplace.[120] A
hazard-based program may not be able to eliminate all risks, but neither does
it accept "satisfactory" â but still risky â outcomes. And as those who
calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the
risks are a different group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass
conflict inherent in a risk-based approach.[citation_needed]
The information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the
specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned
previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have
worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and
official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel
interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices,
events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information
is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be
digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of
the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way
to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical
hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy
to use graphical format.
**** Risk assessment[edit] ****
Further information: Risk_assessment_Â§ Risk_assessment
Modern occupational safety and health legislation usually demands that a risk
assessment be carried out prior to making an intervention. It should be kept in
mind that risk management requires risk to be managed to a level which is as
low as is reasonably practical.[citation_needed]
This assessment should:
    * Identify the hazards
    * Identify all affected by the hazard and how
    * Evaluate the risk
    * Identify and prioritize appropriate control measures[citation_needed]
The calculation of risk is based on the likelihood or probability of the harm
being realized and the severity of the consequences. This can be expressed
mathematically as a quantitative assessment (by assigning low, medium and high
likelihood and severity with integers and multiplying them to obtain a risk
factor), or qualitatively as a description of the circumstances by which the
harm could arise.[citation_needed]
The assessment should be recorded and reviewed periodically and whenever there
is a significant change to work practices. The assessment should include
practical recommendations to control the risk. Once recommended controls are
implemented, the risk should be re-calculated to determine if it has been
lowered to an acceptable level. Generally speaking, newly introduced controls
should lower risk by one level, i.e., from high to medium or from medium to
low.[121]
***** Contemporary developments[edit] *****
On an international scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
International Labour Organization (ILO) have begun focusing on labour
environments in developing nations with projects such as Healthy_Cities.[122]
Many of these developing countries are stuck in a situation in which their
relative lack of resources to invest in OSH leads to increased costs due to
work-related illnesses and accidents. The European Agency for Safety and Health
at Work states indicates that nations having less developed OSH systems spend a
higher fraction of their gross national product on job-related injuries and
illness[123] â taking resources away from more productive activities. The ILO
estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in
Latin America, compared with just 2.6% to 3.8% in the EU."[124] There is
continued use of asbestos, a notorious hazard, in some developing countries. So
asbestos-related disease is, sadly, expected to continue to be a significant
problem well into the future.
**** Nanotechnology[edit] ****
See also: Health_implications_of_nanotechnology
A nanomaterial containment hood, an example of an engineering control used to
protect workers handling them on a regular basis.
Nanotechnology is an example of a new, relatively unstudied technology. A Swiss
survey of one hundred thirty eight companies using or producing nanoparticulate
matter in 2006 resulted in forty completed questionnaires. Sixty five per cent
of respondent companies stated they did not have a formal risk assessment
process for dealing with nanoparticulate matter.[125] Nanotechnology already
presents new issues for OSH professionals that will only become more difficult
as nanostructures become more complex. The size of the particles renders most
containment and personal protective equipment ineffective. The toxicology
values for macro sized industrial substances are rendered inaccurate due to the
unique nature of nanoparticulate matter. As nanoparticulate matter decreases in
size its relative surface area increases dramatically, increasing any catalytic
effect or chemical reactivity substantially versus the known value for the
macro substance. This presents a new set of challenges in the near future to
rethink contemporary measures to safeguard the health and welfare of employees
against a nanoparticulate substance that most conventional controls have not
been designed to manage.[126]
**** Occupational Health Disparities[edit] ****
Occupational health disparities refer to differences in occupational injuries
and illnesses that are closely linked with demographic, social, cultural,
economic, and/or political factors.[127]
***** Education[edit] *****
There are multiple levels of training applicable to the field of occupational
safety and health (OSH). Programs range from individual non-credit
certificates, focusing on specific areas of concern, to full doctoral programs.
The University_of_Southern_California was one of the first schools in the US to
offer a Ph.D. program focusing on the field. Further, multiple master's degree
programs exist, such as that of the Indiana_State_University who offer a master
of science (MS) and a master of arts (MA) in OSH. Graduate programs are
designed to train educators, as well as, high-level practitioners. Many OSH
generalists focus on undergraduate studies; programs within schools, such as
that of the University_of_North_Carolina's online Bachelor of Science in
Environmental Health and Safety, fill a large majority of hygienist needs.
However, smaller companies often do not have full-time safety specialists on
staff, thus, they appoint a current employee to the responsibility. Individuals
finding themselves in positions such as these, or for those enhancing
marketability in the job-search and promotion arena, may seek out a credit
certificate program. For example, the University_of_Connecticut's online OSH
Certificate,[128] provides students familiarity with overarching concepts
through a 15-credit (5-course) program. Programs such as these are often
adequate tools in building a strong educational platform for new safety
managers with a minimal outlay of time and money. Further, most hygienists seek
certification by organizations which train in specific areas of concentration,
focusing on isolated workplace hazards. The American Society for Safety
Engineers (ASSE), American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH), and American
Industrial_Hygiene_Association (AIHA) offer individual certificates on many
different subjects from forklift operation to waste disposal and are the chief
facilitators of continuing education in the OSH sector. In the U.S. the
training of safety professionals is supported by National_Institute_for
Occupational_Safety_and_Health through their NIOSH_Education_and_Research
Centers. In Australia, training in OSH is available at the vocational education
and training level, and at university undergraduate and postgraduate level.
Such university courses may be accredited by an Accreditation Board of the
Safety Institute of Australia. The Institute has produced a Body of Knowledge
[129] which it considers is required by a generalist safety and health
professional, and offers a professional qualification based on a four-step
assessment.
***** World Day for Safety and Health at Work[edit] *****
Main article: Workers'_Memorial_Day
On April 28 The International_Labour_Organization celebrates "World Day for
Safety and Health"[130] to raise_awareness of safety in the workplace.
Occurring annually since 2003,[131] each year it focuses on a specific area and
bases a campaign around the theme.[132]
