Surface mining, including strip mining, open-pit_mining and mountaintop_removal
mining, is a broad category of mining in which soil and rock overlying the
mineral deposit (the overburden) are removed, in contrast to underground
mining, in which the overlying rock is left in place, and the mineral is
removed through shafts or tunnels.
Surface mining began in the mid-sixteenth century[1][dubious  – discuss] and is
practiced throughout the world, although the majority of surface coal mining
occurs in North America.[2] It gained popularity throughout the 20th century,
and surface mines now produce most of the coal mined in the United States.[3]
In most forms of surface mining, heavy equipment, such as earthmovers, first
remove the overburden. Next, large machines, such as dragline_excavators or
Bucket_wheel_excavators, extract the mineral.

***** Types[edit] *****
There are five main forms of surface mining, detailed below.
**** Strip mining[edit] ****
The Bagger_288 is a bucket-wheel_excavator used in strip mining.
"Strip mining" is the practice of mining a seam of mineral, by first removing a
long strip of overlying soil and rock (the overburden). It is most commonly
used to mine coal and lignite_(brown_coal). Strip mining is only practical when
the ore body to be excavated is relatively near the surface. This type of
mining uses some of the largest machines on earth, including bucket-wheel
excavators which can move as much as 12,000 cubic metres of earth per hour.
There are two forms of strip mining. The more common method is "area
stripping", which is used on fairly flat terrain, to extract deposits over a
large area. As each long strip is excavated, the overburden is placed in the
excavation produced by the previous strip.
"Contour mining" involves removing the overburden above the mineral seam near
the outcrop in hilly terrain, where the mineral outcrop usually follows the
contour of the land. Contour stripping is often followed by auger mining into
the hillside, to remove more of the mineral. This method commonly leaves behind
terraces in mountainsides.
Strip mining at Garzweiler, Germany. The lignite being extracted is at left,
the removed overburden being placed at right. Note that it is a largely flat
mine for a horizontal mineral.
**** Open-pit mining[edit] ****
Main article: Open-pit_mining
The El_Chino_mine located near Silver_City,_New_Mexico is an open-pit copper
mine.
"Open-pit_mining" refers to a method of extracting rock or minerals from the
earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Although open-pit
mining is sometimes mistakenly referred to as "strip mining", the two methods
are different (see above).
**** Mountaintop removal[edit] ****
Main article: Mountaintop_removal_mining
"Mountaintop removal mining" (MTR) is a form of coal mining that mines coal
seams beneath mountaintops by first removing the mountaintop overlying the coal
seam. Explosives are used to break up the rock layers above the seam, which are
then removed. Excess mining waste or "overburden" is dumped by large trucks
into fills in nearby hollow or valley fills. MTR involves the mass
restructuring of earth in order to reach the coal seam as deep as 400 feet
(120 m) below the surface. Mountaintop removal replaces the original steep
landscape with a much flatter topography. Economic development attempts on
reclaimed mine sites include prisons such the Big_Sandy_Federal_Penitentiary in
Martin_County,_Kentucky, small town airports, golf courses such as Twisted Gun
in Mingo_County,_West_Virginia and Stonecrest Golf Course in Floyd_County,
Kentucky, as well as industrial scrubber sludge disposal sites, solid waste
landfills, trailer parks, explosive manufacturers, and storage rental lockers.
[4]
The technique has been used increasingly in recent years in the Appalachian
coal fields of West_Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee in the United
States. The profound changes in topography and disturbance of pre-existing
ecosystems have made mountaintop removal highly controversial.
Advocates of mountaintop removal point out that once the areas are reclaimed as
mandated by law, the technique provides premium flat land suitable for many
uses in a region where flat land is rare. They also maintain that the new
growth on reclaimed mountaintop mined areas is better able to support
populations of game animals.[5]
Critics[who?] contend that mountaintop removal is a disastrous practice that
benefits a small number of corporations at the expense of local_communities and
the environment. A U.S._Environmental_Protection_Agency (EPA) environmental
impact_statement finds that streams near valley fills sometimes may contain
higher levels of minerals in the water and decreased aquatic biodiversity.[6]
The statement also estimates that 724 miles (1,165 km) of Appalachian streams
were buried by valley fills from 1985 to 2001.
Blasting at a mountaintop removal mine expels dust and fly-rock into the air,
which can then disturb or settle onto private property nearby. This dust may
contain sulfur compounds, which some claim corrode structures and tombstones
and is a health hazard.[7]
Although MTR sites are required to be reclaimed after mining is complete,
reclamation has traditionally focused on stabilizing rock and controlling
erosion, but not always on reforesting the area.[8] Quick-growing, non-native
grasses, planted to quickly provide vegetation on a site, compete with tree
seedlings, and trees have difficulty establishing root systems in compacted
backfill.[6] Consequently, biodiversity suffers in a region of the United
States with numerous endemic_species.[9] Erosion also increases, which can
intensify flooding. In the Eastern United States, the Appalachian Regional
Reforestation Initiative works to promote the use of trees in mining
reclamation.[10]
**** Dredging[edit] ****
Main article: Gold_dredge
"Dredging" is a method for mining below the water table. It is mostly
associated with gold mining. Small dredges often use suction to bring the mined
material up from the bottom of a water body. Historically, large-scale dredging
often used a floating dredge, a barge-like vessel which scooped material up on
a conveyor belt in front, removed the desirable component on board, and
returned the unwanted material via another conveyor belt in back. In gravel-
filled river valleys with shallow water tables, a floating dredge could work
its way through the loose sediment in a pond of its own making.
**** Highwall mining[edit] ****

Highwall Mining
Highwall mining is another form of mining sometimes conducted to recover
additional coal adjacent to a surface mined area. The method evolved from auger
mining but does not meet the definition of surface mining since it does not
involve the removal of overburden to expose the coal seam. CERB final report
No. 2014-004 "Highwall Mining: Design Methodolgy, Safety, and Suitability" by
Yi Luo characterizes it as a "relatively new semi-surface and semi-underground
coal mining method that evolved from auger mining".[11] In Highwall mining, the
coal seam is penetrated by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam
Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing
forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the
entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the
cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01
m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-
foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the
center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The
Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One
patented Highwall mining systems use augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that
prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the
conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or
other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the
operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the
continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce thousands of tons of
coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas,
trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump
system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.
Recovery is much better than Augering, but the mapping of areas that have been
developed by a Highwall miner are not mapped as rigorously as deep mined areas.
Very little soil is displaced in contrast with mountain top removal; however a
large amount of capital is required to operate and own a Highwall miner. But
then this Highwall mining system is the innovative roadmap future potential and
stay or being better competitive in the area of environmental friendly non
mountain-top (overburden) removal operated by only 4 crew members.
Mapping of the outcrop as well as core hole data and samples taken during the
bench making process are taken into account to best project the panels that the
Highwall miner will cut. Obstacles that could be potentially damaged by
subsidence and the natural contour of the Highwall are taken into account, and
a surveyor points the Highwall miner in a line (Theoretical Survey Plot-Line)
mostly perpendicular to the Highwall. Parallel lines represent the drive cut
into the mountain (up to 1,000 feet (300 m) deep), without heading or
corrective steering actuation on a navigation Azimuth during mining results in
missing a portion of the coal seam and is a potential danger of cutting in
pillars from previous mined drives due to horizontal drift (Roll) of the
Pushbeam-Cuttermodule string. Recently Highwall miners have penetrated more
than 1050 feet into the coal seam, and today's models are capable of going
farther, with the support of gyro navigation and not limited anymore by the
amount of cable stored on the machine. The maximum depth would be determined by
the stress of further penetration and associated specific-power draw, ("Torsion
and Tension" in Screw-Transporters String) but today's optimized Screw-
Transporters Conveying Embodiments (called: Pushbeams) with Visual Product
Development and Flow Simulation Behaviour software "Discrete Element Modeling"
(DEM) shows smart-drive extended penetrations are possible, evenso under steep
inclined angles from horizontal to more than 30 degree downhole. In case of
significant steep mining the new mining method phrase should be "Directional
Mining", dry or wet, Dewatering is developed or Cutting & Dredging through
Screw-Transporters are proactive in developing roadmap of the leading global
Highwall mining company.
***** Transport[edit] *****
In early stages of moving materials out of surface mines, manual labour, horse
drawn vehicles and mining railways moved materials.
Current practices tend to use haul_trucks on haul_roads designed into the
features of the mine.
***** Environmental and health issues[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (November
         2013)
The impact of surface mining on the topography, vegetation, and water resources
has made it highly controversial.[clarification_needed]
Surface mining is subject to state and federal reclamation requirements, but
adequacy of the requirements is a constant source of contention. Unless
reclaimed, surface mining can leave behind large areas of infertile waste rock,
as 70% of material excavated is waste.[citation_needed]
In the United States, the Surface_Mining_Control_and_Reclamation_Act_of_1977
mandates reclamation of surface coal mines. Reclamation for non-coal mines is
regulated by state and local laws, which may vary widely.
**** Human health[edit] ****
The United_Mine_Workers_of_America has spoken against the use of human sewage
sludge to reclaim surface mining sites in Appalachia. The UMWA launched its
campaign against the use of sludge on mine sites in 1999 after eight UMWA
workers became ill from exposure to Class B sludge spread near their workplace.
[12]
**** Environmental impact[edit] ****
According to a 2010 report in the journal Science, mountaintop mining has
caused numerous environmental problems which mitigation practices have not
successfully addressed. For example, valley fills frequently bury headwater
streams causing permanent loss of ecosystems. In addition, the destruction of
large tracts of deciduous forests has threatened several endangered_species and
led to a loss_of_biodiversity.[13]
