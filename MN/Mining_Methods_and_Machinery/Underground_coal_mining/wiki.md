Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued
for its energy_content and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate
electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of
iron from iron_ore and for cement production. In the United_Kingdom and South
Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine - a pit, and
the above-ground structures - a pit_head. In Australia, "colliery" generally
refers to an underground coal mine. In the United_States, "colliery" has been
used to describe a coal mine operation but nowadays the word is not commonly
used.
Coal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early
days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to
large open_cut and long_wall mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of
draglines, trucks, conveyors, hydraulic_jacks and shearers.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_coal_mining
Ships have been used to haul coal since Roman times.
Small-scale mining of surface deposits dates back thousands of years. For
example, in Roman_Britain, the Romans were exploiting most of the major
coalfields by the late 2nd century AD.[1]
The Industrial_Revolution, which began in Britain in the 18th century and later
spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability
of coal to power steam_engines. International trade expanded rapidly when coal-
fed steam engines were built for the railways and steamships.
Until the late nineteenth-century coal was mined underground using a pick and
shovel, and children were often employed underground in dangerous conditions.
[2] Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s. By 1912, surface_mining
was conducted with steam_shovels designed for coal mining.
***** Methods of extraction[edit] *****
The most economical method of coal extraction from coal seams depends on the
depth and quality of the seams, and the geology and environmental factors. Coal
mining processes are differentiated by whether they operate on the surface or
underground. Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines
require washing in a coal_preparation_plant. Technical and economic feasibility
are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions;
overburden characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure,
quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and
floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land
ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface
drainage patterns; groundwater conditions; availability of labor and materials;
coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and
capital investment requirements.[3]
Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining.
The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden,
and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at
depths less than approximately 180 ft (55 m), are usually surface mined.
Coal that occurs at depths of 180 to 300 ft (55 to 90 m) are usually deep
mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example,
some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of 200 ft (60 m) are
mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam 60â90 feet
(20â25 metres). Coals occurring below 300 ft (90 m) are usually deep mined.
[4] However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to
1,000â1,500 feet (300â460 metres) below ground level, for instance Tagebau
Hambach in Germany.
**** Surface mining[edit] ****

When coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal
using open_cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or
strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of
the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the
strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines
which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which
transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this
mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface
or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines
or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured
and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or
conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to
where it will be used.[5]
Most open cast mines in the United States extract bituminous_coal. In Canada
(BC), Australia and South Africa, open_cast_mining is used for both thermal and
metallurgical coals. In New_South_Wales open casting for steam coal and
anthracite is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of
production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of
production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface
mining.[5]
*** Strip mining[edit] ***
Strip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam. This earth is
referred to as overburden and is removed in long strips. The overburden from
the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and
referred to as out-of-pit dumping. Overburden from subsequent strips is
deposited in the void left from mining the coal and overburden from the
previous strip. This is referred to as in-pit dumping.
It is often necessary to fragment the overburden by use of explosives. This is
accomplished by drilling holes into the overburden, filling the holes with
explosives, and detonating the explosive. The overburden is then removed, using
large earth-moving equipment, such as draglines, shovel and trucks, excavator
and trucks, or bucket-wheels and conveyors. This overburden is put into the
previously mined (and now empty) strip. When all the overburden is removed, the
underlying coal seam will be exposed (a 'block' of coal). This block of coal
may be drilled and blasted (if hard) or otherwise loaded onto trucks or
conveyors for transport to the coal preparation (or wash) plant. Once this
strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created
next to it. This method is most suitable for areas with flat terrain.
Equipment to be used depends on geological conditions. For example, to remove
overburden that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator might be
the most productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.[6]
*** Contour mining[edit] ***
The contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a
pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This
method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was
once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus
created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and
created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, a
variety of methods were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-
out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an
initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil
from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural
material 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) wide is often intentionally left at the outer
edge of the mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by
preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill.
The limitations of contour strip mining are both economic and technical. When
the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons
of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment
available, it may not be technically feasible to exceed a certain height of
highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering
method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the
bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.
*** Mountaintop removal mining[edit] ***
Main article: Mountaintop_removal
Mountaintop coal mining is a surface mining practice involving removal of
mountaintops to expose coal seams, and disposing of associated mining
overburden in adjacent "valley fills." Valley fills occur in steep terrain
where there are limited disposal alternatives.
Mountaintop_removal combines area and contour strip mining methods. In areas
with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring near the top of a
ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts.
Overburden is deposited in nearby valleys and hollows. This method usually
leaves the ridge and hilltops as flattened plateaus.[4] The process is highly
controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice of creating
head-of-hollow-fills, or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for
covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.[7][8]
Spoil is placed at the head of a narrow, steep-sided valley or hollow. In
preparation for filling this area, vegetation and soil are removed and a rock
drain constructed down the middle of the area to be filled, where a natural
drainage course previously existed. When the fill is completed, this underdrain
will form a continuous water runoff system from the upper end of the valley to
the lower end of the fill. Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced
to create permanently stable slopes.[6]
**** Underground mining[edit] ****
Main article: Underground_mining_(soft_rock)
Coal wash plant in Clay_County, Kentucky
Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require
underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of
world coal production.[5] In deep mining, the room_and_pillar_or_bord_and
pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left
standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been
developed to a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics),
a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or
retreat_mining, is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars,
thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area
involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.
Modern pillar sections use remote-controlled equipment, including large
hydraulic mobile roof-supports, which can prevent cave-ins until the miners and
their equipment have left a work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to
a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large
pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten
and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the
mobile roof supports leave an area.
Remote Joy HM21 Continuous Miner used underground
There are six principal methods of underground mining:
    * Longwall_mining accounts for about 50 percent of underground production.
      The longwall shearer has a face of 1,000 feet (300 m) or more. It is a
      sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back
      and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an
      armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor
      belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own
      hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining
      progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying
      rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the
      operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels
      of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the
      seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a
      60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows
      their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section,
      the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.[5]
    * Continuous_mining utilizes a Continuous Miner Machine with a large
      rotating steel drum equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal
      from the seam. Operating in a "room and pillar" (also known as "bord and
      pillar") system—where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30-foot
      (5â10 m) "rooms" or work areas cut into the coalbed—it can mine as much
      as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s
      would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45
      percent of underground coal production. Conveyors transport the removed
      coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work
      in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions
      controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous
      mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In
      the US, one can generally cut 20 feet (6 meters) (or a bit more with MSHA
      permission) (12 meters or roughly 40 ft in South Africa before the
      Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter),
      after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced
      again. During servicing, the "continuous" miner moves to another face.
      Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major
      components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be
      able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the "continuous" label.
      However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining
      machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may
      partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and
      therefore, less maneuverable.[citation_needed]
    * Room_and_pillar_mining consists of coal deposits that are mined by
      cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left
      behind in order to keep up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty
      percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to
      leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast
      excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar
      techniques to remove 92 percent of the in situ coal. However, this can be
      extracted at a later stage (see retreat_mining).[5]
    * Blast_mining or conventional mining, is an older practice that uses
      explosives such as dynamite to break up the coal seam, after which the
      coal is gathered and loaded onto shuttle cars or conveyors for removal to
      a central loading area. This process consists of a series of operations
      that begins with âcuttingâ the coalbed so it will break easily when
      blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5
      percent of total underground production in the US today.[citation_needed]
    * Shortwall_mining, a method currently accounting for less than 1 percent
      of deep coal production, involves the use of a continuous mining machine
      with movable roof supports, similar to longwall. The continuous miner
      shears coal panels 150 to 200 feet (45 to 60 metres) wide and more than a
      half-mile (1 km) long, having regard to factors such as geological
      strata.[citation_needed]
    * Retreat_mining is a method in which the pillars or coal ribs used to hold
      up the mine roof are extracted; allowing the mine roof to collapse as the
      mining works back towards the entrance. This is one of the most dangerous
      forms of mining, owing to imperfect predictability of when the roof will
      collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.[citation_needed]
***** Production[edit] *****
Coal production trends 1980-2012 in the top five coal-producing countries (US
EIA)

Coal mine in Australia
Main article: Major_coal_producing_regions
Coal is mined commercially in over 50 countries. Over 7,036 Mt/yr of hard_coal
was produced in 2007, a substantial increase over the previous 25 years.[9] In
2006, the world production of brown_coal (lignite) was slightly over 1,000 Mt,
with Germany the world's largest brown coal producer at 194.4 Mt, and China
second at 100.6 Mt.[10]
Coal production has grown fastest in Asia, while Europe has declined. Since
2013, the world coal production is decreasing, -6% in 2016.[11] The top coal
mining nations are:
2009 estimate of total coal
         production
Country       Production[12]
China         3,450 Mt
United_States 973 Mt
India         557 Mt
Australia     409 Mt
Russia        298 Mt
Indonesia     252 Mt
South_Africa  250 Mt
Poland        135 Mt
Kazakhstan    101 Mt
Colombia      75 Mt
Most coal production is used in the country of origin, with around 16 percent
of hard coal production being exported.
Coal_reserves are available in almost every country worldwide, with recoverable
reserves in around 70 countries. At current production levels, proven coal
reserves are estimated to last 147 years.[13] However, production levels are by
no means level, and are in fact increasing and some estimates are that peak
coal could arrive in many countries such as China and America by around 2030.
Coal_reserves_are_usually_stated_as either (1) "Resources" ("measured" +
"indicated" + "inferred" = "resources", and then, a smaller number, often only
10-20% of "resources", (2) "Run of Mine" (ROM) reserves, and finally (3)
"marketable reserves", which may be only 60% of ROM reserves.[clarification
needed] The standards for reserves are set by stock exchanges, in consultation
with industry associations. For example, in ASEAN countries reserves standards
follow the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC) used by the
Australian_Securities_Exchange.
***** Modern mining[edit] *****

scanner in 2014
Technological advancements have made coal mining today more productive than it
has ever been. To keep up with technology and to extract coal as efficiently as
possible modern mining personnel must be highly skilled and well trained in the
use of complex, state-of-the-art instruments and equipment. Many jobs require
four-year university degrees. Computer knowledge has also become greatly valued
within the industry as most of the machines and safety monitors are
computerized.
The use of sophisticated sensing equipment to monitor air quality is common and
has replaced the use of small animals such as canaries, often referred to as
"miner's_canaries".[14]
In the United States, the increase in technology has significantly decreased
the mining workforce. in 2015 US coal mines had 65,971 employees, the lowest
figure since EIA began collecting data in 1978.[15] However, a 2016 study
reported that a relatively minor investment would allow most coal workers to
retrain for the solar energy industry.[16]

**** Dangers to miners[edit] ****
The_Farmington_coal_mine_disaster kills 78. West Virginia, US, 1968.
Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of
historical coal mining_disasters is a long one. In the US alone, more than
100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents in the twentieth century,[17] 90
percent of the fatalities occurring in the first half of the century.[18] More
than 3,200 died in 1907 alone.[19]
Open cut hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions;
underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse,
rock_burst, outbursts, and gas explosions.
Firedamp explosions can trigger the much-more-dangerous coal_dust explosions,
which can engulf an entire pit. Most of these risks can be greatly reduced in
modern mines, and multiple fatality incidents are now rare in some parts of the
developed world. Modern mining in the US results in approximately 30 deaths per
year due to mine accidents.[20]
However, in lesser developed countries and some developing countries, many
miners continue to die annually, either through direct accidents in coal mines
or through adverse health consequences from working under poor conditions.
China, in particular, has the highest number of coal mining related deaths in
the world, with official statistics claiming that 6,027 deaths occurred in
2004.[21] To compare, 28 deaths were reported in the US in the same year.[22]
Coal production in China is twice that in the US,[23] while the number of coal
miners is around 50 times that of the US, making deaths in coal mines in China
4 times as common per worker (108 times as common per unit output) as in the
US.
Mine disasters have still occurred in recent years in the US,[24] Examples
include the Sago_Mine_disaster of 2006, and the 2007 mine accident in Utah's
Crandall_Canyon_Mine, where nine miners were killed and six entombed.[25] In
the decade 2005-2014, US coal mining fatalities averaged 28 per year.[26] The
most fatalities during the 2005-2014 decade were 48 in 2010, the year of the
Upper_Big_Branch_Mine_disaster in West Virginia, which killed 29 miners.[27]
Miners can be regularly monitored for reduced lung function due to coal dust
exposure using spirometry.
Chronic lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis (black lung) were once common in
miners, leading to reduced life_expectancy. In some mining countries black lung
is still common, with 4,000 new cases of black lung every year in the US (4
percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.2
percent of workers).[28] The use of water sprays in mining equipment reduces
the risk to miners' lungs.[29] Build-ups of a hazardous gas are known as damps,
possibly from the German word "Dampf" which means steam or vapor:
    * Black_damp: a mixture of carbon_dioxide and nitrogen in a mine can cause
      suffocation, and is formed as a result of corrosion in enclosed spaces so
      removing oxygen from the atmosphere.
    * After_damp: similar to black damp, after damp consists of carbon
      monoxide, carbon_dioxide and nitrogen and forms after a mine explosion.
    * Fire_damp: consists of mostly methane, a highly flammable gas that
      explodes between 5% and 15% - at 25% it causes asphyxiation.
    * Stink_damp: so named for the rotten egg smell of the hydrogen_sulfide
      gas, stink damp can explode and is also very toxic.
    * White_damp: air containing carbon monoxide which is toxic, even at low
      concentrations
Noise is also a contributing factor to potential adverse effects on coal
miners' health. Exposure to excessive noise can lead to noise-induced_hearing
loss. Hearing loss developed as a result of occupational exposures is coined
occupational_hearing_loss. To protect miners' hearing, the US Mine_Safety_and
Health_Administration's (MSHA) guidelines for noise place a Permissible
Exposure Limit (PEL) for noise at 90 dBA time-weighted over 8 hours. A lower
cutoff, 85 dBA, is set for a worker to fall into the MSHA Action Level which
dictates that workers be placed into hearing conservation programs.
Noise exposures vary depending on the method of extraction. For example, a
study has found that among surface coal mine operations, dragline equipment
produced the loudest sound at a range of 88-112 dBA.[30] Within longwall
sections, stageloaders used to transport coal from the mining face and shearers
used for extraction represent some of the highest noise exposures. Auxiliary
fans (up to 120 dBA), continuous mining machines (up to 109 dBA), and roof
bolters (up to 103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment within
continuous mining sections.[31] Exposures to noise exceeding 90 dBA can lead to
adverse effects on workers' hearing. The use of administrative_controls and
engineering_controls can be used to reduce noise exposures.
**** Dangers from mining waste[edit] ****
In the 1966 Aberfan_disaster in Wales, a colliery spoil_tip collapsed,
engulfing a school and killing 116 children and 28 adults. Other accidents
involving coal waste include the Martin_County_coal_slurry_spill (USA, 2000)
and the Obed_Mountain_coal_mine_spill (Canada, 2013).
**** Safety Improvements[edit] ****
[File:Make it Safer with Roof Screen.webm]Play_media
A video on the use of roof screens in underground coal mines
Improvements in mining methods (e.g. longwall mining), hazardous gas monitoring
(such as safety-lamps or more modern electronic gas monitors), gas drainage,
electrical_equipment, and ventilation have reduced many of the risks of rock
falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining
process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with
gas_engines.[32] Another innovation in recent years is the use of closed
circuit_escape_respirators, respirators that contain oxygen for situations
where mine ventilation is compromised.[33] Statistical analyses performed by
the US Department of Labor's Mine_Safety_and_Health_Administration (MSHA) show
that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than
half and fatalities by two-thirds. However, according to the Bureau_of_Labor
Statistics, even in 2006, mining remained the second most dangerous occupation
in America, when measured by fatality_rate.[34][verification_needed] However,
these numbers include all mining, with oil_and_gas_mining contributing the
majority of fatalities; coal mining resulted in only 47 fatalities that year.
[34]
***** Environmental impacts[edit] *****
Main article: Environmental_impact_of_the_coal_industry
Environmental activists blocking a coal mine to promote fossil_fuel_phase-out
Coal mining can result in a number of adverse effects on the environment.
Surface mining of coal completely eliminates existing vegetation, destroys the
genetic soil profile, displaces or destroys wildlife and habitat, degrades air
quality, alters current land uses, and to some extent permanently changes the
general topography of the area mined.[35] This often results in a scarred
landscape with no scenic value. Of greater concern, the movement, storage, and
redistribution of soil during mining can disrupt the community of soil
microorganisms and consequently nutrient_cycling processes. Rehabilitation or
reclamation mitigates some of these concerns and is required by US Federal Law,
specifically the Surface_Mining_Control_and_Reclamation_Act_of_1977.
Mine dumps (tailings) could produce acid_mine_drainage which can seep into
waterways and aquifers, with consequences on ecological and human_health.
If underground mine tunnels collapse, they cause subsidence of the ground
above. Subsidence can damage buildings, and disrupt the flow of streams and
rivers by interfering with the natural drainage.
Coal production is a major contributor to global_warming: burning coal
generates large quantities of carbon_dioxide and mining operations can release
methane, a known greenhouse_gas, into the atmosphere. The coal mining industry
is working to improve its public image.[36]

351, South_Africa 261, Germany 196, Poland 144, and Kazakhstan 122.[38][39]
**** Australia[edit] ****
Main article: Coal_mining_in_Australia
Coal is mined in every state of Australia, but mainly in Queensland, New South
Wales and Victoria. It is mostly used to generate electricity, and 75% of
annual coal production is exported, mostly to eastern Asia.
In 2007, 428 million tonnes of coal was mined in Australia.[9] In 2007, coal
provided about 85% of Australia's electricity production.[40] In fiscal year
2008/09, 487 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 261 million tonnes was
exported.[41] In fiscal year 2013/14, 430.9 million tonnes of coal was mined,
and 375.1 million tonnes was exported.[42] In 2013/14, coal provided about 69%
of Australia's electricity production.[43]
In 2013, Australia was the world's fifth-largest coal producer, after China,
the United States, India, and Indonesia. However, in terms of proportion of
production exported, Australia is the world's second largest coal exporter, as
it exports roughly 73% of its coal production. Indonesia exports about 87% of
its coal production.[43]
**** Canada[edit] ****
Canada was ranked as the 15th coal producing country in the world in 2010, with
a total production of 67.9 million tonnes. Canada's coal_reserves, the 12th
largest in the world, are located largely in the province of Alberta.[44]
The first coal mines in North America were located in Joggins and Port_Morien,
Nova_Scotia, mined by French settlers beginning in the late 1600s. The coal was
used for the British garrison at Annapolis_Royal, and in construction of the
Fortress_of_Louisbourg.
**** Chile[edit] ****
Main article: Coal_mining_in_Chile
Compared to other South American countries Chile has limited coal resources.
Only Argentina is similarly poor.[45] Coal is Chile is mostly sub-bituminous
with the exception of the bituminous_coals of the Arauco_Basin in central
Chile.[46]
**** China[edit] ****
Main article: Coal_power_in_China
The People's_Republic_of_China is by far the largest producer of coal in the
world, producing over 2.8 billion tons of coal in 2007, or approximately 39.8
percent of all coal produced in the world during that year.[9] For comparison,
the second largest producer, the United States, produced more than 1.1 billion
tons in 2007. An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining
industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year.[47] Most Chinese
mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of
strip mines. Although there is some evidence of reclamation of mined land for
use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating
significant acreages of abandoned_mined_land, which is unsuitable for
agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife.
Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface subsidence (6â12
meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China
uses some subsidence areas for aquaculture ponds but has more than they need
for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in
China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned
with little or no air_pollution control equipment, it contributes greatly to
visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel.
China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.
**** Colombia[edit] ****
An open-pit coal mine in the Rhineland lignite mining area (Germany).
Some of the world's largest coal reserves are located in South America, and an
opencast mine at CerrejÃ³n in Colombia is one of the world's largest open_pit
mines. Output of the mine in 2004 was 24.9 million tons (compared to total
global hard coal production of 4,600 million tons). CerrejÃ³n contributed about
half of Colombia's coal exports of 52 million tons that year, with Colombia
ranked sixth among major coal exporting nations. The company planned to expand
production to 32 million tons by 2008. The company has its own 150 km standard-
gauge railroad, connecting the mine to its coal-loading terminal at Puerto
BolÃ­var on the Caribbean coast. There are two 120-car unit trains, each
carrying 12,000 tons of coal per trip. The round-trip time for each train,
including loading and unloading, is about 12 hours. The coal facilities at the
port are capable of loading 4,800 tons per hour onto vessels of up to 175,000
tons of dead weight. The mine, railroad and port operate 24 hours per day.
CerrejÃ³n directly employs 4,600 workers, with a further 3,800 employed by
contractors. The reserves at CerrejÃ³n are low-sulfur, low-ash, bituminous
coal. The coal is mostly used for electric power generation, with some also
used in steel manufacture. The surface mineable reserves for the current
contract are 330 million tons. However, total proven reserves to a depth of 300
metres are 3,000 million tons.
The expansion of the CerrejÃ³n mine has been blamed for the forced displacement
of local communities.[48][49]
**** Germany[edit] ****
Germany has a long history of coal mining, going back to the Middle_Ages. Coal
mining greatly increased during the industrial_revolution and the following
decades. The main mining areas were around Aachen, the Ruhr and Saar area,
along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany. These areas grew and
were shaped by coal mining and coal processing, and this is still visible even
after the end of the coal mining.
Coal mining reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. After 1950,
the coal producers started to struggle financially. In 1975, a subsidy was
introduced (Kohlepfennig). In 2007, the Bundestag decided to end subsidies by
2018. As a consequence, RAG_AG, the owner of the two remaining coal mines in
Germany, announced it would close all mines by 2018, thus ending coal mining in
Germany.
**** India[edit] ****
Jharia coal mine
Main article: Coal_mining_in_India
Coal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation starting in
1774 with John Sumner and Suetonius_Grant_Heatly of the East_India_Company in
the Raniganj_Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar_River. Demand for coal
remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this,
production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per
year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the
First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production
reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the
country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st
Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need
for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific
development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal
Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with
the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step
towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni
Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and
which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra
Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties.
SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of
India.
**** Japan[edit] ****
The DaikÅdÅ (å¤§æé), the first adit of the Horonai mine (1879).(also
known as the OtowakÃµ (é³ç¾½å))
Main article: List_of_coal_mines_in_Japan
The richest Japanese coal deposits have been found on HokkaidÅ and KyÅ©shÅ©.
Japan has a long history of coal mining dating back into the Japanese_Middle
Ages. It is said that coal was first discovered in 1469 by a farming couple
near Åmuta, central KyÅ«shÅ«.[50] In 1478, farmers discovered burning stones
in the north of the island, which led to the exploitation of the ChikuhÃµ
coalfield.[51]
Following Japanese industrialization additional coalfields were discovered
northern Japan. One of the first mines in HokkaidÅ was the Hokutan_Horonai
coal_mine.[52]
**** Poland[edit] ****
Main article: Coal_mining_in_Poland
**** Russia[edit] ****
Russia ranked as the fifth_largest_coal_producing_country in 2010, with a total
production of 316.9 Mt. Russia has the world's second largest coal reserves.
[53] Russia and Norway share the coal resources of the Arctic archipelago of
Svalbard, under the Svalbard_Treaty.[citation_needed]
**** Spain[edit] ****
Spain was ranked as the 30th coal producing country in the world in 2010. The
coal miners of Spain were active in the Spanish_Civil_War on the Republican
side. In October 1934, in Asturias, union miners and others suffered a fifteen-
day siege in Oviedo and Gijon. There is a museum dedicated to coal mining in
the region of Catalonia, called Cercs_Mine_Museum.
In October 2018, the SÃ¡nchez_government and Spanish Labour_unions settled an
agreement to close ten Spanish coal mines at the end of 2018. The government
pre-engaged to spend 250 million Euro to pay for early retirements,
occupational retraining and structural change. In 2018, about 2,3 per cent of
the electric energy produced in Spain was produced in coal-burning_power
plants.[54]
**** South Africa[edit] ****
Main article: Coal_in_South_Africa_Â§ Mining
South Africa is one of the ten largest coal producing countries[55][56] and the
fourth largest coal exporting country[57] in the world.
**** Taiwan[edit] ****
Abandoned coal mine in Pingxi, New_Taipei.
In Taiwan, coal is distributed mainly in the northern area. All of the
commercial coal deposits occurred in three Miocene coal-bearing formations,
which are the Upper, the Middle and the Lower Coal Measures. The Middle Coal
Measures was the most important with its wide distribution, great number of
coal beds and extensive potential reserves. Taiwan has coal reserves estimated
to be 100-180 Mt. However, coal output had been small, amounting to 6,948
metric tonnes per month from 4 pits before it ceased production effectively in
2000.[58] The abandoned coal mine in Pingxi_District, New_Taipei has now turned
into the Taiwan_Coal_Mine_Museum.[59]
**** Ukraine[edit] ****
Main article: Coal_in_Ukraine
In 2012 coal production in Ukraine amounted to 85.946 million tonnes, up 4.8%
from 2011.[60] Coal consumption that same year grew to 61.207 million tonnes,
up 6.2% compared with 2011.[60]
More than 90 percent of Ukraine's coal production comes from the Donets_Basin.
[61] The country's coal industry employs about 500,000 people.[62] Ukrainian
coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world, and accidents are common.
[63] Furthermore, the country is plagued with extremely dangerous illegal
mines.[64]
**** United Kingdom[edit] ****
Main article: Coal_mining_in_the_United_Kingdom
A view of Murton colliery near Seaham, United Kingdom, 1843
Before the industrial revolution much of the coal was used near to its
production, although there was an active trade along the North_Sea coast
supplying coal to Yorkshire and London.[1]
Many coalfields were developed in the industrial revolution. The oldest were in
Newcastle and Durham, South_Wales, the Central_Belt of Scotland and the
Midlands, such as those at Coalbrookdale. The oldest continuously worked deep-
mine in the United Kingdom was Tower_Colliery in the South_Wales_coalfield.
This colliery was developed in 1805, and its miners bought it out at the end of
the 20th century, to prevent it from being closed. Tower Colliery was finally
closed on 25 January 2008.[65]
The United Kingdom was ranked as the 24th coal producing country in the world
in 2010, with a total production of 18.2 million tonnes. Coal mining in the
United Kingdom probably dates to Roman_times; coal production increased
significantly during the Industrial_Revolution in the 19th century and peaked
during World_War_I. As a result of its long history with coal Britain's
economically recoverable coal reserves have decreased,[66] and more than twice
as much coal is now imported than produced.[67]
**** United States[edit] ****
Miners at the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine in 1974
Main article: Coal_mining_in_the_United_States
Further information: List_of_coal_mines_in_the_United_States
Coal was mined in America in the early 18th century, and commercial mining
started around 1730 in Midlothian,_Virginia.[68]
The American share of world coal production remained steady at about 20 percent
from 1980 to 2005, at about 1 billion short_tons per year. The United States
was ranked as the second highest coal producing country in the world in 2010,
and possesses the largest coal_reserves in the world. In 2008 then-President
George_W._Bush stated that coal was the most reliable source of electricity.
[69] However, in 2011 President Barack_Obama said that the US should rely more
on "clean" sources of energy that emit lower or no carbon_dioxide pollution.
[70] For a time, while domestic coal consumption for electric power was being
displaced by natural gas, exports were increasing.[71] US net coal exports
increased ninefold from 2006 to 2012, peaked at 117 million short tons in 2012,
then declined to 63 million tons in 2015. In 2015, 60% of net US exports went
to Europe, 27% to Asia.US coal production increasingly comes from strip mines
in the western United States, such as from the Powder_River_Basin in Wyoming
and Montana.[72]
Coal has come under continued price pressure from natural_gas and renewable
energy sources, which has resulted in a rapid decline of coal in the U.S. and
several notable bankruptcies including Peabody_Energy. On 13 April 2016 it
reported, that its revenue had reduced by 17 percent as coal prices fell and
that it had lost two billion dollars the previous year.[73] It then filed
Chapter_11_bankruptcy on 13 April 2016.[73] The Harvard_Business_Review
discussed retraining coal workers for solar_photovoltaic employment because of
the rapid rise in U.S. solar jobs.[74] A 2016 study indicated that this was
technically possible and would account for only 5% of the industrial revenue
from a single year to provide coal workers with job security in the energy
industry as whole.[16]
President_Donald_Trump pledged to bring back coal jobs during the 2016_US
presidential_election, and as president he announced plans to reduce
environmental protection, particularly by repealing the Clean_Power_Plan (CPP).
However, industry observers have warned that this might not lead to a boom in
mining jobs[75] A 2019 projection by the Energy_Information_Administration
estimated that coal production without CPP would decline over coming decades at
a faster rate than indicated in the agency's 2017 projection, which had assumed
the CPP was in effect.[76]
