Mining engineering is an engineering discipline that applies science and
technology to the extraction of minerals from the earth. Mining engineering is
associated with many other disciplines, such as mineral_processing,
Exploration, Excavation, geology, and metallurgy, geotechnical_engineering and
surveying. A mining engineer may manage any phase of mining operations â from
exploration and discovery of the mineral resource, through feasibility_study,
mine design, development of plans, production and operations to mine_closure.
With the process of Mineral_extraction, some amount of waste and uneconomic
material are generated which are the primary source of pollution in the
vicinity of mines. Mining activities by their nature cause a disturbance of the
natural_environment in and around which the minerals are located. Mining
engineers must therefore be concerned not only with the production and
processing of mineral commodities, but also with the mitigation of damage to
the environment both during and after mining as a result of the change in the
mining area. Such Industries go through stringent laws to control the pollution
and damage caused to the environment and are periodically governed by the
concerned departments.

***** History of mining engineering[edit] *****
From prehistoric times to the present, mining has played a significant role in
the existence of the human_race. Since the beginning of civilization people
have used stone and ceramics and, later, metals found on or close to the
Earth's surface. These were used to manufacture early tools and weapons. For
example, high quality flint found in northern France and southern England were
used to set fire and break rock.[1] Flint mines have been found in chalk areas
where seams of the stone were followed underground by shafts and galleries. The
oldest known mine on archaeological record is the "Lion Cave" in Swaziland. At
this site, which radiocarbon_dating indicates to be about 43,000 years old,
paleolithic humans mined mineral hematite, which contained iron and was ground
to produce the red pigment ochre.[2][3]
The ancient_Romans were innovators of mining engineering. They developed large
scale mining methods, such as the use of large volumes of water brought to the
minehead by numerous aqueducts for hydraulic_mining. The exposed rock was then
attacked by fire-setting where fires were used to heat the rock, which would be
quenched with a stream of water. The thermal_shock cracked the rock, enabling
it to be removed. In some mines the Romans utilized water-powered machinery
such as reverse_overshot_water-wheels. These were used extensively in the
copper mines at Rio_Tinto in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels
arranged in pairs, lifting water about 80 feet (24 m).[4]
Black_powder was first used in mining in BanskÃ¡_Å tiavnica, Kingdom_of_Hungary
(present-day Slovakia) in 1627.[5] This allowed blasting of rock and earth to
loosen and reveal ore veins, which was much faster than fire-setting. The
Industrial_Revolution saw further advances in mining technologies, including
improved explosives and steam-powered pumps, lifts, and drills as long as they
remained safe.
***** Education[edit] *****
Colorado School of Mines

college degree. Primarily, training includes a Bachelor_of_Engineering (B.Eng.
or B.E.), Bachelor_of_Science (B.Sc. or B.S.), Bachelor_of_Technology (B.Tech.)
or Bachelor_of_Applied_Science (B.A.Sc.) in Mining Engineering. Depending on
the country and jurisdiction, to be licensed as a mining engineer a Master's
degree; Master_of_Engineering (M.Eng.), Master_of_Science (M.Sc or M.S.) or
Master_of_Applied_Science (M.A.Sc.) maybe required. There are also mining
engineers who have come from other disciplines e.g. from engineering fields
like Mechanical_Engineering, Civil_Engineering, Electrical_Engineering,
Geomatics_Engineering, Environmental_Engineering or from science fields like
Geology, Geophysics, Physics, Geomatics, Earth_Science, Mathematics, However,
this path requires taking a graduate degree such as M.Eng, M.S., M.Sc. or

Witwatersrand offering a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.Sc.
(Eng.)) in Mining Engineering[15] as well as graduate programs (M.Sc.(Eng.) and
Ph.D.) in Mining Engineering.[16]
Some Mining Engineers go on to pursue Doctorate degree programs such as Doctor
of_Philosophy (Ph.D., DPhil), Doctor_of_Engineering (D.Eng., Eng.D.) these
programs involve a very significant original research component and are usually
seen as entry points into Academia.
***** Salary and statistics[edit] *****
Mining salaries are usually determined by the level of skill required, where
the position is, and what kind of organization the engineer is working for.
[citation_needed] When comparing salaries from one region to another, cost of
living and other factors need to be taken into consideration.
Mining engineers in India earn relatively high salaries in comparison to many
other professions,[17] with an average salary of $15,250. However, in
comparison to mining engineer salaries in other regions, such as Canada, the
United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, Indian salaries are low. In
the United_States, there are an estimated 6,150 employed mining engineers, with
a mean yearly salary of U.S. $103,710.[18]
***** Pre-mining[edit] *****
The Prospector by N._C._Wyeth, 1906
Mineral exploration is the process of finding ores (commercially viable
concentrations of minerals) to mine. Mineral exploration is a much more
intensive, organized and professional form of mineral prospecting and, though
it frequently uses the services of prospecting, the process of mineral
exploration on the whole is much more involved.
The foremost stage of mining starts with the process of finding and exploration
of the mineral deposit. In the initial process of mineral exploration, however,
the role of geologists and surveyors is prominent in the pre-feasibility_study
of the future mining operation. Mineral exploration and estimation of reserve
through various prospecting methods are done to determine the method and type
of mining in addition to profitability condition.
**** Mineral discovery[edit] ****
Once a mineral discovery has been made, and has been determined to be of
sufficient economic quality to mine, mining engineers will then work on
developing a plan to mine this effectively and efficiently.
The discovery can be made from research of mineral maps, academic geological
reports or local, state, and national geological reports. Other sources of
information include property assays, well drilling logs, and local word of
mouth. Mineral research may also include satellite and airborne photographs.
Unless the mineral exploration is done on public property, the owners of the
property may play a significant role in the exploration process, and may be the
original discoverer of the mineral deposit.[19]
**** Mineral determination[edit] ****
After a prospective mineral is located, the mining geologist and/or mining
engineer then determines the ore properties. This may involve chemical analysis
of the ore to determine the composition of the sample. Once the mineral
properties are identified, the next step is determining the quantity of the
ore. This involves determining the extent of the deposit as well as the purity
of the ore.[20] The geologist drills additional core samples to find the limits
of the deposit or seam and calculates the quantity of valuable material present
in the deposit.
**** Feasibility study[edit] ****
Main article: Mining_feasibility_study
Once the mineral identification and reserve amount is reasonably determined,
the next step is to determine the feasibility of recovering the mineral
deposit. A preliminary study shortly after the discovery of the deposit
examines the market conditions such as the supply and demand of the mineral,
the amount of ore needed to be moved to recover a certain quantity of that
mineral as well as analysis of the cost associated with the operation. This
pre-feasibility study determines whether the mining project is likely to be
profitable; if it is then a more in-depth analysis of the deposit is
undertaken. After the full extent of the ore body is known and has been
examined by engineers, the feasibility study examines the cost of initial
capital investment, methods of extraction, the cost of operation, an estimated
length of time to payback, the gross revenue and net profit_margin, any
possible resale price of the land, the total life of the reserve, the total
value of the reserve, investment in future projects, and the property owner or
owners' contract. In addition, environmental impact, reclamation, possible
legal ramifications and all government permitting are considered.[21][22] These
steps of analysis determine whether the mine company should proceed with the
extraction of the minerals or whether the project should be abandoned. The
mining company may decide to sell the rights to the reserve to a third party
rather than develop it themselves, or the decision to proceed with extraction
may be postponed indefinitely until market conditions become favorable.
***** Mining operation[edit] *****
Mining engineers working in an established mine may work as an engineer for
operations improvement, further mineral_exploration, and operation
capitalization by determining where in the mine to add equipment and personnel.
The engineer may also work in supervision and management, or as an equipment
and mineral salesperson. In addition to engineering and operations, the mining
engineer may work as an environmental, health and safety manager or design
engineer.
The act of mining required different methods of extraction depending on the
mineralogy, geology, and location of the resources. Characteristics such as
mineral_hardness, the mineral stratification, and access to that mineral will
determine the method of extraction.
Generally, mining is either done from the surface or underground. Mining can
also occur with both surface and underground operations taking place on the
same reserve. Mining activity varies as to what method is employed to remove
the mineral.
**** Surface mining[edit] ****
Surface_mining comprises 90% of the world's mineral tonnage output. Also called
open_pit_mining, surface mining is removing minerals in formations that are at
or near the surface. Ore retrieval is done by material removal from the land in
its natural state. Surface mining often alters the land characteristics, shape,
topography, and geological make-up.
Surface mining involves quarrying which is excavating minerals by means of
machinery such as cutting, cleaving, and breaking. Explosives are usually used
to facilitate breakage. Hard rocks such as limestone, sand, gravel, and slate
are generally quarried into a series of benches.
Strip mining is done on softer minerals such as clays and phosphate are removed
through use of mechanical shovels, track dozers, and front end loaders. Softer
Coal seams can also be extracted this way.
With placer_mining, minerals can also be removed from the bottoms of lakes,
rivers, streams, and even the ocean by dredge mining. In addition, in-situ
mining can be done from the surface using dissolving agents on the ore body and
retrieving the ore via pumping. The pumped material is then set to leach for
further processing. Hydraulic mining is utilized in forms of water jets to wash
away either overburden or the ore itself.[23]
**** Mining process[edit] ****
Blasting:
Explosives are used to break up a rock formation and aid in the collection of
ore in a process called blasting. Blasting utilizes the heat and immense
pressure of the detonated explosives to shatter and fracture a rock mass. The
type of explosives used in mining are high_explosives which vary in composition
and performance properties. The mining engineer is responsible for the
selection and proper placement of these explosives, in order to maximize
efficiency and safety. Blasting occurs in many phases of the mining process,
such as development of infrastructure as well as production of the ore.
Leaching:
Leaching is the loss or extraction of certain materials from a carrier into a
liquid (usually, but not always a solvent). Mostly used in rare-earth metals
extraction.
Flotation:
Flotation (also spelled floatation) involves phenomena related to the relative
buoyancy of minerals. It is the most widely used metal separate method.
Electrostatic separation:
Separating minerals by electro-characteristic differences.
Gravity separation:
Gravity_separation is an industrial method of separating two components, either
a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with
gravity is sufficiently practical.
Magnetic separation:
Magnetic_separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is
extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force.
Hydraulic separation:
Hydraulic_separation is a process that using the density difference to separate
minerals. Before hydraulic separation, minerals were crushed into uniform size;
because minerals have uniform size and different density will have different
settling velocities in water, and that can be used to separate target minerals.

Main article: Mine_Safety_and_Health_Administration
Legal attention to Mining Health and Safety began in the late 19th century and
in the subsequent 20th century progressed to a comprehensive and stringent
codification of enforcement and mandatory health and safety regulation. A
mining engineer in whatever role they occupy must follow all federal, state,
and local mine safety laws.
**** United States[edit] ****
Main article: Mine_Safety_and_Health_Act_of_1977
The United States Congress, through the passage of the Federal Mine_Safety_and
Health_Act_of_1977, known as the Miner's Act, created the Mine_Safety_and
Health_Administration (MSHA) under the US_Department_of_Labor.
This comprehensive Act provides miners with rights against retaliation for
reporting violations, consolidated regulation of coal mines with metallic and
nonmetallic mines, and created the independent Federal_Mine_Safety_and_Health
Review_Commission to review MSHA's reported violations.[24]
The Act as codified in Code of Federal Regulations Â§ 30 (CFR Â§ 30) covers all
miners at an active mine. When a mining engineer works at an active mine he or
she is subject to the same rights, violations, mandatory health and safety
regulations, and mandatory training as any other worker at the mine. The mining
engineer can be legally identified as a "miner."[25]
The Act establishes the rights of miners. The miner may report at any time a
hazardous condition and request an inspection. The miners may elect a miners'
representative to participate during an inspection, pre-inspection meeting, and
post-inspection conference. The miners and miners' representative shall be paid
for their time during all inspections and investigations.[26]

Land reclamation is regulated for surface and underground mines according to
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The law creates as a
part of the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Surface Mining (OSM). OSM
states on their website, âOSM is charged with balancing the nationâs need
for continued domestic coal production with protection of the environment.â
The law requires that states set up their own Reclamation Departments and
legislate laws related to reclamation for coal mining operations. The states
may impose additional regulations and regulate other minerals in addition to
coal for land reclamation.[27]
