****** Rock mass classification ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Rock mass classification systems are used for various engineering design and
stability analysis. These are based on empirical relations between rock mass
parameters and engineering applications, such as tunnels, slopes, foundations,
and excavatability. The first rock mass classification system in geotechnical
engineering was proposed in 1946 for tunnels with steel set support.

***** Design methods[edit] *****
In engineering in rock, three design strategies can be distinguished:
analytical, empirical, and numerical. Empirical, i.e. rock mass classification,
methods are extensively used for feasibility and pre-design studies, and often
also for the final design.
***** Objectives[edit] *****
The objectives of rock mass classifications are (after Bieniawski 1989):
   1. Identify the most significant parameters influencing the behaviour of a
      rock mass.
   2. Divide a particular rock mass formulation into groups of similar
      behaviour â rock mass classes of varying quality.
   3. Provide a basis of understanding the characteristics of each rock mass
      class
   4. Relate the experience of rock conditions at one site to the conditions
      and experience encountered at others
   5. Derive quantitative data and guidelines for engineering design
   6. Provide common basis for communication between engineers and geologists
**** Benefits[edit] ****
The main benefits of rock mass classifications:
   1. Improving the quality of site investigations by calling for the minimum
      input data as classification parameters.
   2. Providing quantitative information for design purposes.
   3. Enabling better engineering judgement and more effective communication on
      a project.
   4. provide a basis for understanding the characteristics of each rock mass

    * Stand-up time classification
    * Rock_Quality_Designation
      The Rock_Quality_Designation index was developed by Deere in the 1960s to
      classify the quality of a rock core based on the integrety of borehole
      cores. Nowadays the classification system itself is not very often used,
      but the determination of the RQD as index for rock core quality is
      standard practice in any geotechnical rock drilling, and is used in many,
      more recent, rock mass classification systems, such as RMR and Q-system
      (see above).
    * Rock_Structure_Rating (RSR)
      The Rock_Structure_Rating system is a quantitative method for describing
      quality of a rock mass and appropriate ground support, in particular, for
      steel-rib support, developed by Wickham, Tiedemann and Skinner in the
      1970s.
