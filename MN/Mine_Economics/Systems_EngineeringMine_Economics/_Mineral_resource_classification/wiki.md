Reporting codes framework with three main categories - Exploration Results,
Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves.[1]
Mineral resource classification is the classification of mineral resources
based on an increasing level of geological knowledge and confidence.[2] Mineral
deposits can be classified as:
    * Mineral resources that are potentially valuable, and for which reasonable
      prospects exist for eventual economic extraction.
    * Mineral reserves or Ore reserves are valuable and legally, economically,
      and technically feasible to extract
In common mining terminology[weasel words], an "ore deposit" by definition must
have an 'ore reserve', and may or may not have additional 'resources'[citation
needed].
Classification, because it is an economic function, is governed by statutes,
regulations and industry best_practice norms. There are several classification
schemes worldwide, the most commonly used are the Canadian CIM classification
(see NI_43-101), the Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC Code),
the South_African_Code_for_the_Reporting_of_Mineral_Resources_and_Mineral
Reserves_(SAMREC)[3] and the âchessboardâ classification scheme of mineral
deposits by H. G. Dill[4].

***** Mineral resources[edit] *****
A 'Mineral Resource' is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic
economic interest in or on the earth's crust in such form, quality and quantity
that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Mineral
Resources are further sub-divided, in order of increasing geological
confidence, into inferred, Indicated and measured as gategories.
Inferred Mineral Resource is the part of a mineral resource for which tonnage,
grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence. It
is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not verified geological or
grade continuity. It is based on information gathered through appropriate
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill
holes which may be of limited or uncertain quality and reliability.
Indicated resources are simply economic mineral occurrences that have been
sampled (from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits and drillholes) to a
point where an estimate has been made, at a reasonable level of confidence, of
their contained metal, grade, tonnage, shape, densities, physical
characteristics.
Measured resources are indicated resources that have undergone enough further
sampling that a 'competent person' (defined by the norms of the relevant mining
code; usually a geologist) has declared them to be an acceptable estimate, at a
high degree of confidence, of the grade, tonnage, shape, densities, physical
characteristics and mineral content of the mineral occurrence.
***** Mineral reserves and ore reserves[edit] *****
Mineral reserves are resources known to be economically feasible for
extraction. Reserves are either Probable ReservesorProved Reserves.
A Probable Ore Reserve is the part of indicated, and in some circumstances,
measured mineral resources that can be mined in an economically viable fashion.
It includes diluting material and allowances for losses which may occur when
the material is mined. A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence
than a Proved Ore Reserve but is of sufficient quality to serve as the basis
for decision on the development of deposit.
A Proved Ore Reserve is the part of Measured resources that can be mined in an
economically viable fashion. It includes diluting materials and allowances for
losses which occur when the material is mined.
A Proved Ore Reserve represents the highest confidence category of reserve
estimate. The style of mineralization or other factors could mean that Proved
Ore Reserves are not achievable in some deposits.
Generally the conversion of resources into reserves requires the application of
various modifying factors, including:
    * mining and geological factors, such as knowledge of the geology of the
      deposit sufficient that it is predictable and verifiable; extraction and
      mine plans based on ore models; quantification of geotechnical
      risk—basically, managing the geological faults, joints, and ground
      fractures so the mine does not collapse; and consideration of technical
      risk—essentially, statistical and variography to ensure the ore is
      sampled properly:
    * metallurgical_factors, including scrutiny of assay data to ensure
      accuracy of the information supplied by the laboratory—required because
      ore reserves are bankable. Essentially, once a deposit is elevated to
      reserve status, it is an economic entity and an asset upon which loans
      and equity can be drawn—generally to pay for its extraction at
      (hopefully) a profit;
    * economic factors;
    * environmental factors;
    * marketing factors;
    * legal factors;
    * political factors;and
    * social factors[3]
