***** History[edit] *****
In 1909, Michio_Suzuki (1887â1982) founded the Suzuki Loom Works in the small
seacoast village of Hamamatsu, Japan. Business boomed as Suzuki built weaving
looms for Japan's giant silk industry.[9] In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new
type of weaving machine, which was exported overseas. The company's first 30
years focused on the development and production of these machines.[citation
needed]
Despite the success of his looms, Suzuki believed that his company would
benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products. Based on
consumer demand, he decided that building a small car would be the most
practical new venture. The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki
had completed several compact prototype cars. These first Suzuki motor vehicles
were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-cylinder
engine. It had a cast aluminum crankcase and gearbox and generated 13
horsepower (9.7 kW) from a displacement of less than 800cc.[citation_needed]
With the onset of World War II, production plans for Suzuki's new vehicles were
halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a "non-essential
commodity." At the conclusion of the war, Suzuki went back to producing looms.
Loom production was given a boost when the U.S. government approved the
shipping of cotton to Japan. Suzuki's fortunes brightened as orders began to
increase from domestic textile manufacturers. But the joy was short-lived as
the cotton market collapsed in 1951.[citation_needed]
Faced with this colossal challenge, Suzuki returned to the production of motor
vehicles. After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable
personal transportation. A number of firms began offering "clip-on" gas-powered
engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle. Suzuki's first two-
wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the "Power Free."
Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the 1952_Power
Free had a 36 cc, one horsepower, two-stroke engine.[10] The new double-
sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the engine
assisting, pedal without engine assist, or simply disconnect the pedals and run
on engine power alone.[citation_needed] The patent office of the new democratic
government granted Suzuki a financial subsidy to continue research in
motorcycle engineering.
1955 Suzulight
By 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and had officially
changed its name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. Following the success of its first
motorcycles, Suzuki created an even more successful automobile: the 1955 Suzuki
Suzulight. The Suzulight sold with front-wheel drive, four-wheel independent
suspension and rack-and-pinion steering, which were not common on cars until
three decades later.[citation_needed]
Volkswagen held a 19.9% non-controlling shareholding in Suzuki between 2009 and
2015. An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake
back to Suzuki.[11] Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back in
September 2015.[12]
**** Leadership[edit] ****
The company was founded by Michio_Suzuki; its current Chairman is Osamu_Suzuki,
[13] the fourth adopted_son-in-law in a row to run the company,[14]

The Suzuki Loom Company started in 1909 as a manufacturer of looms for weaving
silk and cotton. Michio Suzuki was intent on making better, more user-friendly
looms and, for 30 years his focus was on the development of these machines.
Michio's desire to diversify into automotive products was interrupted by World
War II.[15] Before it began building four-stroke_engines, Suzuki Motor Corp.
was known for its two-stroke_engines (for motorcycles and autos).[16] After the
war, Suzuki made a two-stroke motorized_bicycle, but eventually the company
would be known for Hayabusa and GSX-R motorcycles, for the QuadRunner, and for
dominating racetracks around the world. Even after producing its first car in
1955 the company didn't have an automobile division until 1961.[17] Today
Suzuki is among the world's largest automakers, and a major brand name in
important markets, including Japan and India, but no longer sells cars in North
America.[18]

the Maruti_Suzuki_XA_Alpha,[187][188] to commence production in mid-late 2013.
Maruti Suzuki unveiled the Vitara Brezza in the Indian Auto Expo 2016 as a
contender in the compact SUV segment.
Maruti_Exports Limited is Maruti's exporting subsidiary and, as such, does not
operate in the domestic Indian market except in its capacity as an exporter for
Maruti_Suzuki and for the international Suzuki_Motor_Corporation as well as
their other affiliates. The first commercial consignment of 480 cars were sent
to Hungary. By sending a consignment of 571 cars to the same country, Maruti
crossed the benchmark of 3,000,000 cars. Since its inception export was one of
the aspects the government has been keen to encourage.
**** American Suzuki Motor Corp.[edit] ****
American Suzuki headquarters is in Brea, California. The company announced in
November 2012 that it would stop selling cars in the United States.[189][190]
Through an agreement with General_Motors, Suzuki began selling a version of
their Suzuki_Cultus in the United States as the Chevrolet_Sprint in 1985. This
model was initially sold as a 3-door hatchback and would be Chevrolet's
smallest model.
2004 Suzuki XL-7
The Samurai was also introduced in 1985 for the 1986 model year and was the
first car introduced to the United States by the newly created American Suzuki
Corp. No other Japanese company sold more cars in the United States in its
first year than Suzuki. The Samurai was available as a convertible or hardtop
and the company slogan was Never a Dull Moment. The Samurai was successful
until Consumer_Reports alleged the Samurai of being susceptible to roll over in
a 1988 test. This led to a much publicized 1996_lawsuit, not settled until
2004.
In 1989, American Suzuki introduced the Swift which was the 2nd generation
Suzuki Cultus. The Swift was available as a GTi and GLX hatchback with a 4-door
sedan following in 1990. A new small SUV called the Sidekick was also
introduced in 1989. 1991 saw the introduction of the 4-door Suzuki Sidekick,
the first 4-door mini-SUV in North America. The Swift and Sidekick were cousins
to GM's Geo_Metro and Geo_Tracker and were mostly produced in Ingersoll,
Ontario, Canada by Suzuki and GM's joint venture, CAMI. The Swift GT/GTi and 4-
door models were imported from Japan. Negative evaluations from Consumer
Reports of the Suzuki Samurai led to some temporary setbacks at American Suzuki
as annual sales in the following years dropped to below 20,000 units.
In 1995, American Suzuki introduced the Esteem and redesigned the Swift. The
Swift GT was dropped and this version Swift was specific only to North America
where it was built at CAMI. These models were the first Suzuki vehicles to be
marketed in North America with dual front airbags. A station_wagon version of
the Esteem was introduced in 1996. Worldwide Suzuki production reached more
than 975,000 cars this[which?] year.
Also in 1996, American Suzuki released the 2-door SUV X-90 and a revised
Sidekick_Sport model with dual_airbags, a 95 hp (71 kW) 1.6 liter engine,
15 inch wheels. The Sidekick was replaced by the Vitara and the Grand_Vitara
for 1999. The Grand Vitara would be Suzuki's first model with a V6-cylinder
engine and available 4-wheel ABS brakes.
The XL-7 was introduced in 1998 as a stretched version of the Grand Vitara. The
XL-7 had a larger 2.7 liter V6-cylinder engine and 3-row seating. This would be
Suzuki's largest vehicle to date.
The Swift was dropped from the model lineup in 2001 and the Esteem was replaced
in 2002 by the new Aerio, which was offered as a 4-door sedan and 5-door
crossover with 4-wheel_drive as an option.
In 2004, General Motors and Suzuki jointly purchased the bankrupt Daewoo_Motors
renaming the venture GMDAT. American Suzuki rebadged the compact Daewoo_Nubira/
Daewoo_Lacetti as the Forenza and the mid-size Daewoo_Magnus as the Verona. The
Forenza gained station_wagon and hatchback body style in 2005, with the
hatchback sold under the Reno name.
2006 was the first year American Suzuki sold more than 100,000 vehicles in the
United States. Suzuki redesigned the Grand Vitara in 2006 as well as introduced
the all-new Suzuki_SX4 and Suzuki_XL7 in 2007. The Suzuki_SX4 is produced as a
joint venture with Fiat and the XL7 (notice the shortening of the name from
Grand Vitara XL-7) was produced as a joint venture with GM at CAMI Automotive
Inc. in Ingersoll. Suzuki put XL7 production on indefinite hiatus in mid-2009
due to low demand and subsequently sold off its share of CAMI back to GM later
that year.
Despite a difficult domestic US automarket, Suzuki kept pace with its 2007
sales numbers in 2008. In 2009 however, Suzuki sales dropped 48.5%,[191]
following a 17% sales drop in 2008.[192] Suzuki did not import any 2010 model
year street motorcycles into the US, with dealers instead relying on unsold
stock from the 2009 model year.[193][194] New street motorcycle models to the
US resumed for the 2011 model year.[195]
In November 2012, Suzuki announced that its US division would file for
bankruptcy and would stop selling automobiles in the United States. It plans to
continue to sell motorcycles, ATVs, and marine products in the US.[189] In ten
months of 2012, Suzuki only sold 21,188 automobiles in the US. The combination
of a strong yen and Suzuki's own limited offering of models has been blamed for
the downturn.[190]
**** Pakistani Suzuki Motor Company Limited[edit] ****
The Suzuki_FX was the first car that was assembled by Pak Suzuki in Pakistan.
Following the terms of the joint-venture agreement between Suzuki Motor
Corporation of Japan (SMC) and Pakistan Automobile Corporation (PACO), Pak
Suzuki_Motor_Company_Limited_(PSMCL) was incorporated as a public limited
company in August 1983.[196]
The new company assumed the assets including production facilities of Awami
Autos Limited. PSMCL started commercial operations in January 1984 with the
primary objective of passenger cars, pick ups, vans and 4x4 vehicles.
The groundbreaking ceremony of the company's green field automobile plant at
Bin Qasim was performed by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan in early 1989.
On completion of first phase of this plant in early 1990, in-house assembly
Suzuki engines started. The new plant was completed in 1992, and Suzuki
production was transferred to new plant â and three-box 1,300 cc Margalla car
was also added to its range of production.
In September 1992 the company was privatized and placed directly under the
Japanese Management. At the time of privatization SMC increased its equity from
25% to 40% Subsequently, SMC progressively increased its equity to 73.09% by 31
December 2001.
The Bin Qasim Plant further expanded its production capacity to 50,000 vehicles
per year in July 1994 and 300,000 vehicles had been manufactured at this plant
by December 2003.

**** Concept automobiles[edit] ****
GSX-R/4 concept car
Suzuki Pixy + SSC concept vehicles at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show
Suzuki G70 (nÃ©e Regina) concept car at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show
Suzuki Q-Concept car at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show
    * GSX-R/4 concept car was presented in 2001. It is fitted with a 1,300 cm3
      (79 cu in) engine taken from the GSX1300R_Hayabusa motorcycle in an
      attempt to split the difference, merging the posture of an automobile and
      the disposition of a sportbike (Suzuki had been particularly successful
      selling motorcycles in the United States). Its high-revving inline-four
      engine supplied about 175 hp to a bare-bones, two-seat roadster weighing
      less than 1500 pounds.[201]
    * Pixy + SSC concept was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The Pixy
      is an enclosed three-wheel, single-seat personal transport pod, similar
      to the Toyota_i-unit, and i-REAL, but dissimilar in that two Pixies can
      dock inside the SSC (aka Suzuki Sharing Coach) for highway driving.
      Electric power is generated by a hydrogen fuel cell and solar panels to
      drive the SSC carrier van, and to recharge the Pixy at the same time.
      [202][203]
    * Suzuki_Concept_X debuted at the 2005 North_American_International_Auto
      Show as a significant departure in styling for a Suzuki mid-sized sport
      utility_vehicle aimed at younger buyers in the North American market.
      [204] This concept vehicle evolved into the second-generation XL7
      introduced late in 2006.[205]
    * G70 appeared at the 2011 Tokyo_Motor_Show as the Regina, but was renamed
      before the 2012 Salon_International_de_l'Auto[206] and Auto_China[207]
      shows to signify that it met the goal of carbon_dioxide_(CO2)_emissions
      no higher than 70g/km (and perhaps that Regina as a model name would be a
      marketing fiasco). The G70 is a concept for the next-generation global
      compact car, possibly replacing the Alto, and at 3,550 millimetres
      (140 in) long and 1,630 mm (64 in) wide with a weight of 730 kilograms
      (1,610 lb), the G70 is smaller and lighter than the Alto. It has an
      extremely economical 800 cubic centimetres (49 cu in), direct-injection
      turbo gasoline engine mated to a continuously_variable_transmission, and
      a claimed fuel mileage of 3.1 litres per 100 kilometres (91 mpg‑imp;

      in length, the Q-concept has its driver and one passenger riding in
      tandem but is more comfortable than a motorcycle, being enclosed and
      having seats instead of a saddle. Intended primarily for short trips
      (within 10 kilometres (6.2 mi)) it ought to be able to park in nearly any
      available space.[209][210]

***** Motorcycles[edit] *****
Suzuki started manufacturing motorcycles in 1952, the first models being
motorized bicycles.[20] From 1955 to 1976[42] the company manufactured
motorcycles with two-stroke engines only, the biggest two-stroke model being
the water-cooled triple-cylinder GT750.
A large factor in Suzuki's success in two-stroke competition was the East
German Grand_Prix racer Ernst_Degner, who defected to the West in 1961,[211]
bringing with him expertise in two-stroke engines from the East German
manufacturer MZ. The secrets Degner brought with him were the work of Walter
Kaaden, who combined three crucial technologies for the first time: the boost
port,[212][213] the expansion_chamber, and the rotary_valve.[214]
Suzuki hired Degner, and he won the 50_cc_class FIM road_racing World
Championship for them in the 1962_season. Suzuki became the first Japanese
manufacturer to win a motocross_world_championship when Joel_Robert won the
1970 250 cc title. In the 1970s, Suzuki established themselves in the
motorcycle racing world with Barry_Sheene Marco_Lucchinelli1981 Franco
Uncini1982 winning world championships in the premier 500cc class.
In 1976 Suzuki introduced its first motorcycles since the Colleda COX[20] of
the 1950s with four-stroke engines, the GS400 and GS750.
In 1994, Suzuki partnered with Nanjing_Jincheng_Machinery to create a Chinese
motorcycle manufacturer and exporter called Jincheng_Suzuki.
Suzuki continued to compete in MotoGP and last won the title in the 2000
season. From 2006 to 2011, the team was sponsored by Rizla and was known as
Rizla_Suzuki MotoGP team. On 18 November 2011, Suzuki announced that the GP
racing was suspended, partly due to natural disasters and recession, until
2014.[215] Suzuki returned to MotoGP in 2015.[216]
In addition Suzuki have recorded a total of 93 victories at the Isle_of_Man_TT
Races.[217] Suzuki have also taken the runner up spot in the various race
categories 100 times and a total 92 third places.[217]
**** Models[edit] ****

Some notable Suzuki motorcycles include the following:
*** Two-stroke_engines[edit] ***
Suzuki T20 (front) and T500 Titan (rear) at Le Salon de la Moto 2011 in Paris
Suzuki RGV250Î at the Barber_Vintage_Motorsport_Museum in 2006
    * X6_Hustler twin (aka T20 Super Six) was sold from 1966 to 1968 as "the
      fastest 250cc motorcycle in the world". It had Suzuki's new Posi-Force
      automatic oil injection system (later called Suzuki_CCI).[15][16][218]
      Production peaked at more than 5000 units per month.[219] In 2013, Suzuki
      renewed the Hustler motorcycle trademark for Europe, leading to rumors of
      a retro_style 250 twin.[220][221] A 1967 T20 Super Six was included in
      the Las Vegas show of The_Art_of_the_Motorcycle exhibition.[222]
    * T500_Titan (aka T500 Cobra, GT500) had a 500 cc air-cooled parallel-twin
      engine which overcame problems with durability, overheating and
      vibration. With an output of 47 metric horsepower (35 kW) at 6,500 rpm
      and top speed of 180 kilometres per hour (110 mph), it became Suzuki's
      flagship machine in 1968, and remains popular with collectors and cafÃ©
      racers.[223][224][225][226]
    * GT750_Le_Mans with a straight-three_engine was the first Japanese
      motorcycle with a liquid-cooled_engine, earning it the moniker "Water
      Buffalo."[15][223] The Society_of_Automotive_Engineers_of_Japan (in
      Japanese) includes the 1971 Suzuki GT750 as one of their 240 Landmarks of
      Japanese Automotive Technology.[41]
    * TM400_Cyclone production motocrosser was designed to participate in 500cc
      class Motocross_World_Championship racing. Introduced in 1971, it was
      notoriously difficult even for skilled riders to control. Redesigned in
      1975.[227][228][229]
    * The RM125 production motocrosser debuted in 1975 to replace the TM125. It
      was a successful forerunner of the future RM_series line-up from 50cc to
      500cc.[230]
    * RM250 was fully redesigned in 1982 and the liquid-cooled single-cylinder
      delivered more power than any production 250cc motorcrosser of the time.
      It had Suzuki's original full floater, link-type rear suspension
      introduced a year earlier.[231]
    * RG250_Gamma of 1983 was one of the new generation of race_replica sport
      bikes of the 1980s. It had an aluminum frame, a full_fairing and a high
      output straight-twin_engine.[232][233] The 1983 RG250Î is one of the
      JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.[66]
    * RG500_Gamma of 1985 was like RG250, but with a square-four_engine.[234]
    * RGV250_Gamma, the road-racing replica of Kevin_Schwantz's RGV500 GP race
      bike, replaced the RG250 in 1988 with a V-twin_engine.[235]
*** Four-stroke_engines[edit] ***
Suzuki GS1000S at the Barber_Vintage_Motorsport_Museum in 2006
Suzuki DR800S
Suzuki GSX-R1000 at the Tokyo_Motor_Show in 2007
    * GS_series â The 1976 GS750 was the first 4-stroke machine released by
      Suzuki in 20 years. The following year saw Suzuki's first 1-liter
      machine, the GS1000E, and then in 1979 the GS1000S copy of a Yoshimura
      GS1000_Superbike.[15][16]
    * Katana â The GSX1100S was released in Europe in 1980; the GSX1000S
      arrived in the U.S. and Canada later that year as a 1981 model, and
      revolutionized sportbike styling.[236] A 1982 Katana GS1000SV is on the
      AMA Motorcycle_Hall_of_Fame's list of "classic bikes" that have been
      shown in the museum,[237] and was in The Art of the Motorcycle
      exhibition.[222]
    * GSX-R750 was one of the Japanese sport bikes of the 1980s that began the
      modern race replica era.[238] It had air/oil cooling, light weight, and a
      powerful engine.[239][240] The Society_of_Automotive_Engineers_of_Japan
      (in Japanese) includes the 1984 Suzuki GSX-R750 as one of their 240
      Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology,[72] and was in The Art of
      the Motorcycle.[222]
    * Intruder_750 with its OHC 4-valve 45Â° V-twin_engine was the first
      Japanese cruiser motorcycle (designed to appeal to U.S. riders) in 1985.
      By 1997, cruiser-style motorcycles would account for nearly 60 percent of
      the U.S. street-bike market.[54][241]
    * GSX-R1100, related to the GSX-R750, appeared in 1986.[54][242] The same
      basic engine would reappear in 1995 to power the Bandit_1200 and remain
      in production through 2006.[243][244]
    * The DR-BIG aka Desert Express DR800S (in German) off-roader was existent
      for two model years as the DR750S (in German) until 1990, when its
      displacement increased to 779cc, still the world largest single cylinder
      engine in a production motorcycle.[245] Available in Europe through 1999,
      it was not exported to the U.S. market.[246] Replaced by the V-Strom
      twin, the DR-BIG has now come full circle as the design inspiration for a
      2014 overhaul of the V-Strom 1000 ABS.[247]
    * Suzuki_RF_Series The Suzuki RF series are sport touring motorcycles. They
      came with three engine variations: 400, 600 and 900 cc. It was in
      production from 1994 to 1998.
    * TL1000S debuted at the 1996 International_Motorcycle_and_Scooter_Show as
      the first Suzuki sport bike with a V-twin_engine.[248] This was a liquid-
      cooled, 90Â° V-twin, DOHC engine with 4 valves per cylinder, which would
      be in production through 2012.[247] Although the TL1000S motorcycle
      ceased production in 2001, the engine would carry on in the TL1000R, the
      SV1000 and SV1000S,[249] as well as the V-Strom_1000.[250]
    * GSX-R600 â a smaller version of the GSX-R750. There were earlier
      pretenders,[251] but the genuine article arrived in 1997 and has received
      frequent updates after that.[252][253][254]
    * Hayabusa (GSX-1300R) was introduced in 1998, and remains Suzuki's
      flagship sport_bike.[255][256] The 1998 Suzuki Hayabusa is included in
      the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.[111] The
      development of a second_generation Hayabusa for the 2008 model year
      facilitated the 2007 roll-out of the GSX-1300BK B-King,[257] a highly
      stylized naked variant.[258][259]
    * SV650 was introduced in 1999 as a budget entry in the naked bike market,
      [260][261] and since 2001, offered both naked and fully faired.[262] In
      2009 the naked_bike version was redesigned and renamed the Gladius in
      keeping with the sword motif Suzuki established with the Katana.[263] The
      Gladius motorcycle won a Good_Design_Award (aka G Mark) from the Japan
      Institute_of_Design_Promotion.[264]
    * GSX-R1000 â This top-of-the-line superbike debuted in 2000,[265] and
      remains the largest model of the GSX-R series.[171][172]
    * Burgman_650 (AN650) was the largest of a series of urban scooters
      produced in Japan (marketed as Skywave domestically) as well as in Italy
      and Spain with engine capacities of 125cc and up. When it appeared in
      2002 the 650 was the largest-displacement scooter in the world, and first
      two-wheel vehicle to have an electrically controlled Continuously
      Variable_Transmission.[266][267] The Japan_Institute_of_Design_Promotion
      awarded the G Mark Good_Design_Award to the Skywave 650 in 2003, to the
      entire Skywave series in 2006 and to the updated Skywave 650LX in 2013.
      [268][269][270]
          o Choinori was a lightweight, inexpensive, 50cc scooter and the
            antithesis of the Skywave_650, but they were introduced at the same
            time in an effort to increase domestic sales in response to
            shrinking motorcycle exports.[271][272] The 2002 Choinori is one of
            the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.[122] The
            Choinori was awarded the G Mark Good_Design_Award in 2003.[273]
    * Boulevard_M109R (VZR1800) V-twin, dubbed the Intruder M1800R in Europe,
      arrived in 2006 boasting a 112 mm (4.4 in) bore with a 90.5 mm (3.56 in)
      stroke, amongst the largest gasoline engine pistons ever used in any
      production motorcycle (or passenger car).[274][275][276]
    * GSX-650F â introduced in 2008, this new sport touring model fills the
      void of the retired Katana. The 2009 model has ABS standard.
    * Suzuki_DR125 - a 124cc four stroke motorcycle
    * DL-650_V-Strom â a dual-sport_motorcycle
    * GSX-250F_Across â a small 250 cc engine sport touring_motorcycle
      produced from 1990 until 1998. It is mostly known as a practical sports/
      touring bike, due to its rear petrol tank and a fully enclosed helmet
      storage area where the petrol tank usually is.
    * Suzuki GSX-R250 â a motorcycle that was manufactured from 1987 to 1994.
      A couple of years after the presentation of the GSX-R750 the 250 cc GSX-
      R250 was released. Like the larger bike, the GSX-R250 had a box-frame
      (steel, not aluminum), full fairing, full-floater rear swing and a four-
      cylinder four-stroke engine. But while the GSX-R750 engine was air and
      oil-cooled, the baby brother had a liquid-cooled engine. Not many
      examples are seen outside Japan. 17-inch cast wheels and 300 mm twin disc
      brake at the front. The GSX-R250 had impressive power and was made
      primarily as a road legal 250 cc racing bike reaching speeds of 200+km/h
      (124 mph). Imported specimens may be seen in Australia and New Zealand
      commonly. Also, around 350 units were exported to Denmark around 1989 to
      1992.

Cutaway model of the Burgman Fuel Cell Scooter at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show
    * RE5 was the first (and only) Japanese motorcycle produced with a Wankel
      rotary_engine. That, and its Giugiaro styling, make it one of the oddest
      and most collectible motorcycles of the 1970s.[277][278] The 1974 RE5 is
      one of the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology,[44] and
      a 1976 model is in the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame.[279]
    * Burgman Fuel-Cell Scooter uses electric-motor propulsion, powered by an
      air-cooled hydrogen fuel_cell; its only emission is water. Following on a
      concept model at the 2009 Tokyo_Motor_Show, in 2011 the Burgman Fuel-Cell
      Scooter became the world's first fuel-cell vehicle to earn Whole_Vehicle
      Type_Approval (WVTA) in the European Union, enabling the vehicle to be
      sold in all member states.[165][276] Suzuki is working toward commercial
      production of this scooter.[164][280]
**** Concept motorcycles[edit] ****
Suzuki Biplane concept motorcycle at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show
Suzuki Crosscage fuel-cell concept at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show
Suzuki_Gemma prototype scooter at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show
    * Falcorustyco concept model at the 1985 Tokyo_Motor_Show envisaged the
      motorcycle technologies that might be brought into play by 1995,
      including a 4-cycle square 4-cylinder 500 cc engine, frameless body,
      front-and-rear swingarm suspension, center hub hydraulic power steering,
      chainless hydraulic drive and pop-up screen cowling.[281][282][283]
    * Nuda was a full-time two-wheel drive prototype, incorporating power
      steering and a swing seat, in a carbon fiber honeycomb monocoque body,
      shown at the 1986 Tokyo Motor Show. Nuda concepts influenced the design
      of the Suzuki_Hayabusa.[281][283][284][285]
    * B-King â The concept model was well received by the public when it went
      on display at the 2001 Tokyo Motor Show. The addition of a turbocharger
      to the GSX1300R engine testified to massive power output, while
      electronics such as cellphone and GPS were stowed in the ultra-modern
      angular bodywork. The production model appeared six years later, largely
      unchanged except for its naturally_aspirated_engine.[257][286][287] B-
      King styling is reflected in the award-winning_design of the GSR600[288]
      and the GSR750, as well as the Inazuma GW250 and GW250S.[289][290]
    * G-Strider concept model with 916 cc engine, made public at the 2003 Tokyo
      Motor Show, was a half-scooter, half-cruiser_(motorcycle) mash-up with an
      electrically controlled Continuously_Variable_Transmission incorporating
      a push-button manual mode, similar to the Burgman 650. Accentuating
      luxury, the G-Strider's handlebars, footrests, seat backrest, passenger
      backrest and windscreen were all electrically adjustable while under way
      to ensure the most comfortable riding position possible.[283][291][292]
    * Stratosphere prototype was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2005, with an
      1100 cc engine pushed to the limits of space-saving design, resulting in
      an in-line six-cylinder as wide as a conventional in-line four-cylinder
      engine. Hammered aluminum and Damascus steel incorporate material
      characteristics into styling design. Prospects for a production model
      seemed good, considering that Suzuki's previous significant concept
      motorcycle, the B-King had made it into production, but the market
      changed before Stratosphere got the go-ahead.[283][292][293][294]
    * Biplane was a blue-sky concept announced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show,
      designed to convey the joy of two-wheel mobility, inspired by the feeling
      of flying an airplane. Its shape generates a feeling of openness in a
      modern machine powered by a V-four engine.[295][296][297]
    * Crosscage concept model was displayed at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show.
      Combining a high-performance secondary battery and a compact, lightweight
      air-cooled fuel-cell system from British specialist company Intelligent
      Energy enabled quick activation with low fuel consumption. The lithium-
      ion battery assured reserve power as well as minimal environmental
      impact. Light weight not only made this bike environment-friendly but
      also sporty.[295][297]
    * Gemma prototype model was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The
      distinctive "full-flat 2-seater," 250 cc four-stroke single-cylinder
      scooter is low and sleek and gives the rider and passenger feel a greater
      sense of intimacy. The luggage compartment in front of the rider holds a
      helmet. Gemma went into production in Japan the following year for the
      domestic market.[298][299][300]

      Its name suggests that Toyota is serious about this device. Do you think

      stage further with its Pixy + SSC. The Pixy part is, again, a three-
      wheeled, single-seater pod, this time weatherproof with a windscreen and
      roof, two of which can dock inside the Suzuki Sharing Coach (SSC) for

      according to Suzuki. The large dual seat is almost completely flat to
      keep rider and passenger weight low, and a large lockable cubby hole in
      front of the rider is big enough to take a helmet. The gemma is currently
      just a concept, but the concept appears well developed enough to reach
      production if the Japanese public like the idea.

      July 2008. Retrieved 28 October 2013. The scooter looks set for the
      Japanese market only for the time being, but given the recent fuel price
      hikes there are strong rumours of it finding its way over here. Using the
      motor from the four-stroke 250cc Burgman, but with a new management
      system, the bike will be a full seven kilos lighter than the Burgman,
      10cm longer with a longer wheelbase for stability.
