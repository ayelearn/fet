Structure of a carboxylic acid
Carboxylate Anion
3D structure of a carboxylic acid
A carboxylic acid is an organic_compound that contains a carboxyl group (C
(=O)OH).[1] The general formula of a carboxylic acid is RâCOOH, with R
referring_to_the_rest of the (possibly quite large) molecule. Carboxylic acids
occur widely. Important examples include the amino_acids (which make up
proteins) and acetic_acid (which is part of vinegar). Deprotonation of a
carboxyl group gives a carboxylate anion. Important carboxylate salts are
soaps.

***** Example carboxylic acids and nomenclature[edit] *****
Carboxylic acids are commonly identified by their trivial_names. They often
have the suffix -ic acid. IUPAC-recommended names also exist; in this system,
carboxylic acids have an -oic acid suffix.[2] For example, butyric_acid
(C3H7CO2H) is butanoic acid by IUPAC guidelines. For nomenclature of complex
molecules containing a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position
one of the parent_chain even if there are other substituents, for example, 3-
chloropropanoic_acid. Alternately, it can be named as a "carboxy" or
"carboxylic acid" substituent on another parent structure, for example, 2-
carboxyfuran.
The carboxylate anion (RâCOOâ or RCO2â) of a carboxylic acid is usually
named with the suffix -ate, in keeping with the general pattern of -ic acid and
-ate for a conjugate_acid and its conjugate base, respectively. For example,
the conjugate base of acetic_acid is acetate.

***** Physical properties[edit] *****
**** Solubility[edit] ****
Carboxylic acids are polar. Because they are both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the
carbonyl âC=O) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl âOH), they also
participate in hydrogen_bonding. Together the hydroxyl and carbonyl group forms
the functional group carboxyl. Carboxylic acids usually exist as dimers in
nonpolar media due to their tendency to "self-associate". Smaller carboxylic
acids (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble in water, whereas higher carboxylic acids
have limited solubility due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl
chain. These longer chain acids tend to be rather soluble in less-polar
solvents such as ethers and alcohols.[3] Even hydrophobic carboxylic acids
react aqueous sodium hydroxide to give water-soluble sodium salts. For example,
enathic_acid has a small solubility in water (0.2 g/L), but its sodium salt is
very soluble in water:
[Solubility_in_different_environments.jpg]
**** Boiling points[edit] ****
Carboxylic acids tend to have higher boiling points than water, not only
because of their increased surface area, but also because of their tendency to
form stabilised dimers through hydrogen_bonds. For boiling to occur, either the
dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised,
both of which increase the enthalpy_of_vaporization requirements significantly.
Carboxylic acid dimers
**** Acidity[edit] ****
Carboxylic acids are BrÃ¸nstedâLowry_acids because they are proton (H+)
donors. They are the most common type of organic_acid.
Carboxylic acids are typically weak_acids, meaning that they only partially
dissociate into H3O+ cations and RCOOâ anions in neutral aqueous solution.
For example, at room temperature, in a 1-molar solution of acetic_acid, only
0.4% of the acid are dissociated. Electron-withdrawing substituents, such as -
CF3_group, give stronger acids (the pKa of formic acid is 3.75 whereas
trifluoroacetic acid, with a trifluoromethyl_substituent, has a pKa of 0.23).
Electron-donating substituents give weaker acids (the pKa of formic acid is
3.75 whereas acetic acid, with a methyl_substituent, has a pKa of 4.76)
Carboxylic acid[4]              pKa
Acetic_acid (CH3CO2H)           4.76
Benzoic_acid (C6H5CO2H)         4.2
Formic_acid (HCOOH)             3.75
Chloroacetic_acid (CH2ClCO2H)   2.86
Dichloroacetic_acid (CHCl2CO2H) 1.29
Oxalic_acid (HO2CCO2H)          1.27
(first dissociation)
Oxalic_acid (HO2CCO2â)     4.14
(second dissociation)
Trichloroacetic_acid (CCl3CO2H) 0.65
Trifluoroacetic_acid (CF3CO2H)  0.23
Deprotonation of carboxylic acids gives carboxylate anions; these are resonance
stabilized, because the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen
atoms, increasing the stability of the anion. Each of the carbonâoxygen bonds
in the carboxylate anion has a partial double-bond character. The carbonyl
carbon's partial positive charge is also weakened by the -1/2 negative charges
on the 2 oxygen atoms.
**** Odor[edit] ****
Carboxylic acids often have strong sour odors. Esters of carboxylic acids tend
to have pleasant odors, and many are used in perfume.
**** Characterization[edit] ****
Carboxylic acids are readily identified as such by infrared_spectroscopy. They
exhibit a sharp band associated with vibration of the CâO vibration bond
(Î½C=O) between 1680 and 1725 cmâ1. A characteristic Î½OâH band appears as
a broad peak in the 2500 to 3000 cmâ1 region.[3] By 1H NMR spectrometry, the
hydroxyl hydrogen appears in the 10â13 ppm region, although it is often
either broadened or not observed owing to exchange with traces of water.
***** Occurrence and applications[edit] *****
Many carboxylic acids are produced industrially on a large scale. They are also
pervasive in nature. Esters of fatty acids are the main components of lipids
and polyamides of aminocarboxylic acids are the main components of proteins.
Carboxylic acids are used in the production of polymers, pharmaceuticals,
solvents, and food additives. Industrially important carboxylic acids include
acetic acid (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), acrylic
and_methacrylic_acids (precursors to polymers, adhesives), adipic_acid
(polymers), citric_acid (beverages), ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid (chelating
agent), fatty_acids (coatings), maleic_acid (polymers), propionic_acid (food
preservative), terephthalic_acid (polymers).
***** Synthesis[edit] *****
**** Industrial routes[edit] ****
In general, industrial routes to carboxylic acids differ from those used on
smaller scale because they require specialized equipment.
    * Carbonylation of alcohols as illustrated by the Cativa_process for
      production of acetic acid. Formic acid is prepared by a different
      carbonylation pathway, also starting from methanol.
    * Oxidation of aldehydes with air using cobalt and manganese catalysts. The
      required aldehydes are readily obtained from alkenes by hydroformylation.
    * Oxidation of hydrocarbons using air. For simple alkanes, this method is
      inexpensive but not selective enough to be useful. Allylic and benzylic
      compounds undergo more selective oxidations. Alkyl groups on a benzene
      ring are oxidized to the carboxylic acid, regardless of its chain length.
      Benzoic_acid from toluene, terephthalic_acid from para-xylene, and
      phthalic_acid from ortho-xylene are illustrative large-scale conversions.
      Acrylic_acid is generated from propene.[5]
    * Oxidation of ethene using silicotungstic_acid catalyst.
    * Base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols.
    * Carbonylation is versatile method when coupled to the addition of water.
      This method is effective for alkenes that generate secondary and tertiary
      carbocations, e.g. isobutylene to pivalic_acid. In the Koch_reaction, the
      addition of water and carbon monoxide to alkenes is catalyzed by strong
      acids. Hydrocarboxylations involve the simultaneous addition of water and
      CO. Such reactions are sometimes called "Reppe_chemistry":
      HCCH + CO + H2O â CH2=CHCO2H
    * Some long-chain carboxylic acids are obtained by the hydrolysis of
      triglycerides obtained from plant or animal oils; these methods are
      related to soap_making.
    * fermentation of ethanol is used in the production of vinegar.
**** Laboratory methods[edit] ****
Preparative methods for small scale reactions for research or for production of
fine chemicals often employ expensive consumable reagents.
    * oxidation_of_primary_alcohols or aldehydes with strong oxidants such as
      potassium_dichromate, Jones_reagent, potassium_permanganate, or sodium
      chlorite. The method is amenable to laboratory conditions compared to the
      industrial use of air, which is "greener", since it yields less inorganic
      side products such as chromium or manganese oxides.
    * Oxidative cleavage of olefins by ozonolysis, potassium_permanganate, or
      potassium_dichromate.
    * Carboxylic acids can also be obtained by the hydrolysis of nitriles,
      esters, or amides, in general with acid- or base-catalysis.
    * Carbonation of a Grignard and organolithium reagents:
      RLi + CO2 â RCO2Li
      RCO2Li + HCl â RCO2H + LiCl
    * Halogenation followed by hydrolysis of methyl_ketones in the haloform
      reaction
    * The KolbeâSchmitt_reaction provides a route to salicylic_acid,
      precursor to aspirin.
    * Base-catalyzed cleavage of non-enolizable ketones, especially aryl
      ketones:[6]
      RC(O)Ar + H2O â RCO2H + ArH
**** Less-common reactions[edit] ****
Many reactions afford carboxylic acids but are used only in specific cases or
are mainly of academic interest:
    * Disproportionation of an aldehyde in the Cannizzaro_reaction
    * Rearrangement of diketones in the benzilic_acid_rearrangement involving
      the generation of benzoic acids are the von_Richter_reaction from
      nitrobenzenes and the KolbeâSchmitt_reaction from phenols.
***** Reactions[edit] *****
Carboxylic acid organic_reactions
The most widely practiced reactions convert carboxylic acids into esters,
amides, carboxylate salts, acid chlorides, and alcohols. Carboxylic acids react
with bases to form carboxylate salts, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl
(âOH) group is replaced with a metal cation. Thus, acetic acid found in
vinegar reacts with sodium_bicarbonate (baking soda) to form sodium acetate,
carbon_dioxide, and water:
      CH3COOH + NaHCO3 â CH3COOâNa+ + CO2 + H2O
Carboxylic acids also react with alcohols to give esters. This process is
widely used, e.g. in the production of polyesters. Likewise, carboxylic acids
are converted into amides, but this conversion typically does not occur by
direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine. Instead esters are
typical precursors to amides. The conversion of amino_acids into peptides is a
major biochemical process that requires ATP.
The hydroxyl group on carboxylic acids may be replaced with a chlorine atom
using thionyl_chloride to give acyl_chlorides. In nature, carboxylic acids are
converted to thioesters.
**** Reduction[edit] ****
Like esters, most of carboxylic acid can be reduced to alcohols by
hydrogenation or using hydride or alkyl transferring agents (since they will
deprotonate the acids instead without trasfer) such as lithium_aluminium
hydride or Grignard_reagents (organolithium compounds).
N,N-Dimethyl(chloromethylene)ammonium chloride (ClHC=N+(CH3)2Clâ) is a highly
chemoselective agent for carboxylic acid reduction. It selectively activates
the carboxylic acid to give the carboxymethyleneammonium salt, which can be
reduced by a mild reductant like lithium tris(t-butoxy)aluminum hydride to
afford an aldehyde in a one pot procedure. This procedure is known to tolerate
reactive carbonyl functionalities such as ketone as well as moderately reactive
ester, olefin, nitrile, and halide moieties.[7]
**** Specialized reactions[edit] ****
    * As with all carbonyl compounds, the protons on the Î±-carbon are labile
      due to ketoâenol_tautomerization. Thus, the Î±-carbon is easily
      halogenated in the HellâVolhardâZelinsky_halogenation.
    * The Schmidt_reaction converts carboxylic acids to amines.
    * Carboxylic acids are decarboxylated in the Hunsdiecker_reaction.
    * The DakinâWest_reaction converts an amino acid to the corresponding
      amino ketone.
    * In the BarbierâWieland_degradation, an carboxylic acid on an aliphatic
      chain having a simple the methylene_bridge at the alpha position can have
      the chain shortened by one carbon. The inverse procedure is the
      ArndtâEistert_synthesis, where an acid is converted into acyl halide,
      which is then reacted with diazomethane to give one additional methylene
      in the aliphatic chain.
    * Many acids undergo oxidative_decarboxylation. Enzymes that catalyze these
      reactions are known as carboxylases (EC 6.4.1) and decarboxylases
      (EC 4.1.1).
    * Carboxylic acids are reduced to aldehydes via the ester and DIBAL, via
      the acid chloride in the Rosenmund_reduction and via the thioester in the
      Fukuyama_reduction.
    * In ketonic_decarboxylation carboxylic acids are converted to ketones.
    * Organolithium reagents (>2 equiv) react with carboxylic acids to give a
      dilithium 1,1-diolate, a stable tetrahedral_intermediate which decomposes
      to give a ketone upon acidic workup.
    * The Kolbe_electrolysis is an electrolytic, decarboxylative dimerization
      reaction. In other words, it gets rid of the carboxyl groups of two acid
      molecules, and joins the remaining fragments together.
***** Carboxyl radical[edit] *****
The radical â¢COOH (CAS# 2564-86-5) has only a fleeting isolated existence.[8]
The acid_dissociation_constant of â¢COOH has been measured using electron
paramagnetic_resonance spectroscopy.[9] The carboxyl group tends to dimerise to
form oxalic_acid.
