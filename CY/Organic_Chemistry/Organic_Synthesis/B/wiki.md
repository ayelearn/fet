B or b (pronounced /biÃ‹Â/ BEE)[1][2] is the second letter of the Latin-script
alphabet. It represents the voiced_bilabial_stop in many languages, including
English. In some other languages, it is used to represent other bilabial
consonants.

[Uncial_B] [Insular_b] [Blackletter_b] [Antiqua_B] [Roman_B_&_b]
Old_English was originally written in runes, whose equivalent letter was beorc
&#x27e8;Ã¡Â›Â’&#x27e9;, meaning "birch". Beorc dates to at least the 2nd-century
Elder_Futhark, which is now thought to have derived from the Old_Italic
alphabets' &#x27e8;Â Ã°ÂÂŒÂÂ &#x27e9; either directly or via Latin &#x27e8;
[B]&#x27e9;.
The uncial &#x27e8;[B]&#x27e9; and half-uncial &#x27e8;[b]&#x27e9; introduced
by the Gregorian and Irish_missions gradually developed into the Insular
scripts' &#x27e8;[b]&#x27e9;. These Old_English_Latin_alphabets supplanted the
earlier runes, whose use was fully banned under King_Canute in the early 11th
century. The Norman_Conquest popularised the Carolingian half-uncial forms
which latter developed into blackletter &#x27e8;Â [b]Â &#x27e9;. Around 1300,
letter_case was increasingly distinguished, with upper- and lower-case B taking
separate meanings. Following the advent of printing in the 15th century, Holy
Roman_Empire (Germany) and Scandinavia continued to use forms of blackletter
(particularly Fraktur), while England eventually adopted the humanist and
antiqua scripts developed in Renaissance_Italy from a combination of Roman
inscriptions and Carolingian texts. The present forms of the English_cursive B
were developed by the 17th century.
The Roman &#x27e8;B&#x27e9; derived from the Greek capital beta
&#x27e8;ÃÂ’&#x27e9; via its Etruscan and Cumaean variants. The Greek letter was
an adaptation of the Phoenician letter bÃ„Â“t &#x27e8;Ã°ÂÂ¤Â&#x27e9;.[3] The
Egyptian hieroglyph for the consonant /b/ had been an image of a foot_and_calf
&#x27e8;Â [B]Â &#x27e9;,[4] but bÃ„Â“t (Phoenician for "house") was a modified form
of a Proto-Sinaitic glyph &#x27e8;Â [Bet]Â &#x27e9; probably adapted from the
separate hieroglyph_Pr &#x27e8; [Per] &#x27e9; meaning "house".[5][6] The
Hebrew letter beth &#x27e8;Ã—Â‘&#x27e9; is a separate development of the
Phoenician letter.[3]
By Byzantine_times, the Greek letter &#x27e8;ÃÂ’&#x27e9; came to be pronounced /
v/,[3] so that it is known in modern_Greek as vÃƒÂ­ta (still written ÃÂ²ÃÂ®ÃÂ„ÃÂ±).
The Cyrillic letter ve &#x27e8;ÃÂ’&#x27e9; represents the same sound, so a
modified form known as be &#x27e8;ÃÂ‘&#x27e9; was developed to represent the
Slavic_languages' /b/.[3] (Modern Greek continues to lack a letter for the
voiced bilabial plosive and transliterates such sounds from other languages
using the digraph/consonant_cluster &#x27e8;ÃÂ¼ÃÂ€&#x27e9;, mp.)
***** Use in writing systems *****
**** English ****
In English, &#x27e8;b&#x27e9; denotes the voiced_bilabial_stop /b/, as in bib.
In English, it is sometimes silent. This occurs particularly in words ending in
&#x27e8;mb&#x27e9;, such as lamb and bomb, some of which originally had a /b/
sound, while some had the letter &#x27e8;b&#x27e9; added by analogy (see
Phonological_history_of_English_consonant_clusters). The &#x27e8;b&#x27e9; in
debt, doubt, subtle, and related words was added in the 16th century as an
etymological_spelling, intended to make the words more like their Latin
originals (debitum, dubito, subtilis).
As /b/ is one of the sounds subject to Grimm's_Law, words which have
&#x27e8;b&#x27e9; in English and other Germanic_languages may find their
cognates in other Indo-European_languages appearing with &#x27e8;bh&#x27e9;,
&#x27e8;p&#x27e9;, &#x27e8;f&#x27e9; or &#x27e8;ÃÂ†&#x27e9; instead.[3] For
example, compare the various cognates of the word brother. It is the seventh
least_frequently_used_letter in the English language (after V, K, J, X, Q, and
Z), with a frequency of about 1.5% in words.
**** Other languages ****
Many other languages besides English use &#x27e8;b&#x27e9; to represent a
voiced_bilabial_stop.
In Estonian, Icelandic, and Chinese Pinyin, &#x27e8;b&#x27e9; does not denote a
voiced consonant. Instead, it represents a voiceless /p/ that contrasts with
either a geminated /p:/ (in Estonian) or an aspirated /pÃŠÂ°/ (in Pinyin, Danish
and Icelandic) represented by &#x27e8;p&#x27e9;. In Fijian &#x27e8;b&#x27e9;
represents a prenasalised /mb/, whereas in Zulu and Xhosa it represents an
implosive /Ã‰Â“/, in contrast to the digraph &#x27e8;bh&#x27e9; which represents
/b/. Finnish uses &#x27e8;b&#x27e9; only in loanwords.
**** Phonetic transcription ****
In the International_Phonetic_Alphabet, [b] is used to represent the voiced
bilabial_stop phone. In phonological transcription systems for specific
languages, /b/ may be used to represent a lenis phoneme, not necessarily
voiced, that contrasts with fortis /p/ (which may have greater aspiration,
tenseness or duration).
***** Other uses *****
Main article: B_(disambiguation)
B is also a musical_note. In English-speaking_countries, it represents Si, the
12th note of a chromatic_scale built on C. In Central Europe and Scandinavia,
"B" is used to denote B-flat and the 12th note of the chromatic scale is
denoted "H". Archaic forms of 'b', the b quadratum (square b, &#x266e;) and b
rotundum (round b, &#x266d;) are used in musical_notation as the symbols for
natural and flat, respectively.
In Contracted (grade 2) English braille, 'b' stands for "but" when in
isolation.
In computer science, B is the symbol for byte, a unit of information storage.
In engineering, B is the symbol for bel, a unit of level.
In chemistry, B is the symbol for boron, a chemical_element.
The blood-type B emoji (Ã°ÂŸÂ…Â±Ã¯Â¸Â) was added in Unicode 6.0 in 2010, and became a
popular internet_meme in 2018 where letters would be replaced with the emoji.
