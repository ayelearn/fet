Organic Syntheses is a peer-reviewed scientific_journal that was established in
1921. It publishes detailed and checked procedures for the synthesis of organic
compounds. A unique feature of the review process is that all of the data and
experiments reported in an article must be successfully repeated in the
laboratory of a member of the editorial_board as a check for reproducibility
prior to publication.[1][2] The journal is published by Organic Syntheses,
Inc., a non-profit corporation.[3] An annual print version is published by John
Wiley_&_Sons on behalf of Organic Syntheses, Inc.

***** History[edit] *****
Prior to World_War_I, work on synthetic organic chemistry in the United States
had been quite limited, and most of the reagents used in laboratories had to be
imported from Europe. When export stoppages and trade embargoes cut off this
source, Clarence Derick, a professor of chemistry at University_of_Illinois_at
Urbana-Champaign, began an effort to synthesize these needed chemicals in
industrial quantities in a university laboratory with the help of a few
graduate students. This work was performed during the summer break and came to
be known as the "summer prep". Students who worked in the laboratory were paid
and received credit.[4]
The basic procedures were often obtained from textbooks, and the procedures
were sketchy. Reproducibility was important in summer preps, so students were
required to keep meticulous record books. The procedures were finally collected
and published for the first time in a four-pamphlet set called Organic Chemical
Reagents, which quickly sold out. The publishers received submissions from
other chemists, which spawned the idea for serial publication, and the first
annual volume of Organic Syntheses was thus published in 1921. By then,
chemists from other universities and industry were also contributing.[4]
One example of much needed chemicals were dyes for sensitizing photographic
film. Research efforts in this field led to the foundation of Eastman_Kodak
Organic Chemicals Division.[4]
The summer preps contributed to the war effort in World_War_II but were
discontinued in 1950 because by then an infrastructure of chemical companies
with their own research had been established.
Until 1998, Organic Syntheses was published only as an annual printed volume.
In that year, all past volumes were made available on an open access website
and new articles are now published online as soon as they are accepted.[5]
