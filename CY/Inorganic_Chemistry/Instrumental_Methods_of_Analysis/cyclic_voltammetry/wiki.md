Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a type of potentiodynamic electrochemical
measurement. In a cyclic voltammetry experiment, the working electrode
potential is ramped linearly versus time. Unlike in linear_sweep_voltammetry,
after the set potential is reached in a CV experiment, the working electrode's
potential is ramped in the opposite direction to return to the initial
potential. These cycles of ramps in potential may be repeated as many times as
needed. The current at the working_electrode is plotted versus the applied
voltage (that is, the working electrode's potential) to give the cyclic
voltammogram trace. Cyclic voltammetry is generally used to study the
electrochemical properties of an analyte in solution[1][2][3][4] or of a
molecule that is adsorbed onto the electrode.

***** Experimental method[edit] *****
Figure 2. Cyclic voltammetry waveform.
In cyclic voltammetry, the electrode potential ramps linearly versus time in
cyclical phases (Figure 2). The rate of voltage change over time during each of
these phases is known as the experiment's scan rate (V/s). The potential is
measured between the working electrode and the reference electrode, while the
current is measured between the working electrode and the counter electrode.
These data are plotted as current (i) versus applied potential (E, often
referred to as just 'potential'). In Figure 2, during the initial forward scan
(from t0 to t1) an increasingly reducing potential is applied; thus the
cathodic current will, at least initially, increase over this time period
assuming that there are reducible analytes in the system. At some point after
the reduction potential of the analyte is reached, the cathodic current will
decrease as the concentration of reducible analyte is depleted. If the redox
couple is reversible then during the reverse scan (from t1 to t2) the reduced
analyte will start to be re-oxidized, giving rise to a current of reverse
polarity (anodic current) to before. The more reversible the redox couple is,
the more similar the oxidation peak will be in shape to the reduction peak.
Hence, CV data can provide information about redox potentials and
electrochemical reaction rates.
For instance, if the electron transfer at the working electrode surface is fast
and the current is limited by the diffusion of analyte species to the electrode
surface, then the peak current will be proportional to the square_root of the
scan rate. This relationship is described by the RandlesâSevcik_equation. In
this situation, the CV experiment only samples a small portion of the solution,
i.e., the diffusion_layer at the electrode surface.
***** Characterization[edit] *****
The utility of cyclic voltammetry is highly dependent on the analyte being
studied. The analyte has to be redox active within the potential window to be
scanned.
**** The analyte is in solution[edit] ****
*** Reversible couples[edit] ***
Often the analyte displays a reversible CV wave (such as that depicted in
Figure 1), which is observed when all of the initial analyte can be recovered
after a forward and reverse scan cycle. Although such reversible couples are
simpler to analyze, they contain less information than more complex waveforms.
The waveform of even reversible couples is complex owing to the combined
effects of polarization and diffusion. The difference between the two peak
potentials (Ep), ÎEp, is of particular interest.
      ÎEp = Epa - Epc > 0
This difference mainly results from the effects of analyte diffusion rates. In
the ideal case of a reversible 1e- couple, ÎEp is 57 mV and the full-width
half-max of the forward scan peak is 59 mV. Typical values observed
experimentally are greater, often approaching 70 or 80 mV. The waveform is also
affected by the rate of electron transfer, usually discussed as the activation
barrier for electron_transfer. A theoretical description of polarization
overpotential is in part described by the ButlerâVolmer_equation and Cottrell
equation equations. In an ideal system the relationships reduces to      E  p a
&#x2212;  E  p c   =    56.5  &#xA0;mV   n     {\displaystyle E_{pa}-E_{pc}=
{\frac {56.5{\text{ mV}}}{n}}}  [E_{{pa}}-E_{{pc}}={\frac  {56.5{\text{ mV}}}
{n}}] for an n electron process.[2]
Focusing on current, reversible couples are characterized by ipa/ipc = 1.
When a reversible peak is observed, thermodynamic_information in the form of a
half cell potential E01/2 can be determined. When waves are semi-reversible
(ipa/ipc is close but not equal to 1), it may be possible to determine even
more specific information (see electrochemical_reaction_mechanism).
*** Nonreversible couples[edit] ***
Many redox processes observed by CV are quasi-reversible or non-reversible. In
such cases the thermodynamic potential E01/2 is often deduced by simulation.
The irreversibility is indicated by ipa/ipc â  1. Deviations from unity are
attributable to a subsequent_chemical_reaction that is triggered by the
electron transfer. Such EC processes can be complex, involving isomerization,
dissociation, association, etc.[5][6]
**** The analyte is adsorbed onto the electrode surface[edit] ****
Adsorbed species give simple voltammetric responses: ideally, at slow scan
rates, there is no peak separation, the peak width is 90mV for a one-electron
redox couple, and the peak current and peak area are proportional to scan rate
(observing that the peak current is proportional to scan rate proves that the
redox species that gives the peak is actually immobilised).[1] The effect of
increasing the scan rate can be used to measure the rate of interfacial
electron transfer and/or the rates of reactions that are coupled to electron
transfer. This technique has been useful to study redox proteins, some of which
readily adsorb on various electrode materials, but the theory for biological
and non-biological redox molecules is the same (see the page about protein_film
voltammetry).
***** Experimental setup[edit] *****
CV experiments are conducted on a solution in a cell fitted with electrodes.
The solution consists of the solvent, in which is dissolved electrolyte and the
species to be studied.[7]
**** The cell[edit] ****
A standard CV experiment employs a cell fitted with three electrodes: reference
electrode, working_electrode, and counter_electrode. This combination is
sometimes referred to as a three-electrode_setup. Electrolyte is usually added
to the sample solution to ensure sufficient conductivity. The solvent,
electrolyte, and material composition of the working electrode will determine
the potential range that can be accessed during the experiment.
The electrodes are immobile and sit in unstirred solutions during cyclic
voltammetry. This "still" solution method gives rise to cyclic voltammetry's
characteristic diffusion-controlled peaks. This method also allows a portion of
the analyte to remain after reduction or oxidation so that it may display
further redox activity. Stirring the solution between cyclic voltammetry traces
is important in order to supply the electrode surface with fresh analyte for
each new experiment. The solubility of an analyte can change drastically with
its overall charge; as such it is common for reduced or oxidized analyte
species to precipitate out onto the electrode. This layering of analyte can
insulate the electrode surface, display its own redox activity in subsequent
scans, or otherwise alter the electrode surface in a way that affects the CV
measurements. For this reason it is often necessary to clean the electrodes
between scans.
Common materials for the working electrode include glassy_carbon, platinum, and
gold. These electrodes are generally encased in a rod of inert insulator with a
disk exposed at one end. A regular working electrode has a radius within an
order of magnitude of 1 mm. Having a controlled surface area with a well-
defined shape is necessary for being able to interpret cyclic voltammetry
results.
To run cyclic voltammetry experiments at very high scan rates a regular working
electrode is insufficient. High scan rates create peaks with large currents and
increased resistances, which result in distortions. Ultramicroelectrodes can be
used to minimize the current and resistance.
The counter electrode, also known as the auxiliary or second electrode, can be
any material that conducts current easily and will not react with the bulk
solution. Reactions occurring at the counter electrode surface are unimportant
as long as it continues to conduct current well. To maintain the observed
current the counter electrode will often oxidize or reduce the solvent or bulk
electrolyte.
**** Solvents[edit] ****
CV can be conducted using a variety of solutions. Using typical electrodes,
solvents dissolve not only the analyte, often at mM levels, but also
electrolyte, generally at much higher concentrations. For aqueous solutions,
these requirements are trivial, but for nonaqueous solutions, the choices of
suitable solvents are fewer.[8]
**** Electrolyte[edit] ****
The electrolyte ensures good electrical conductivity and minimizes iR drop such
that the recorded potentials correspond to actual potentials. For aqueous
solutions, many electrolytes are available, but typical ones are alkali metal
salts of perchlorate and nitrate. In nonaqueous solvents, the range of
electrolytes is more limited, and a popular choice is tetrabutylammonium
hexafluorophosphate.[9]
***** Related potentiometric techniques[edit] *****
Potentiodynamic techniques also exist that add low-amplitude AC perturbations
to a potential ramp and measure variable response in a single frequency (AC
voltammetry) or in many frequencies simultaneously (potentiodynamic
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy).[10] The response in alternating
current is two-dimensional, characterized by both amplitude and phase. These
data can be analyzed to determine information about different chemical
processes (charge transfer, diffusion, double layer charging, etc.). Frequency
response analysis enables simultaneous monitoring of the various processes that
contribute to the potentiodynamic AC response of an electrochemical system.
Whereas cyclic voltammetry is not a hydrodynamic_technique, useful
electrochemical methods are. In such cases, flow is achieved at the electrode
surface by stirring the solution, pumping the solution, or rotating the
electrode as is the case with rotating_disk_electrodes and rotating_ring-disk
electrodes. Such techniques target steady state conditions and produce
waveforms that appear the same when scanned in either the positive or negative
directions, thus limiting them to linear_sweep_voltammetry.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) has become an important and widely used
electroanalytical technique in many areas of chemistry. It is often used to
study a variety of redox processes, to determine the stability of reaction
products, the presence of intermediates in redox reactions,[11] electron
transfer kinetics,[12] and the reversibility of a reaction.[13] CV can also be
used to determine the electron stoichiometry of a system, the diffusion
coefficient of an analyte, and the formal reduction potential of an analyte,
which can be used as an identification tool. In addition, because concentration
is proportional to current in a reversible, Nernstian system, the concentration
of an unknown solution can be determined by generating a calibration curve of
current vs. concentration.[14]
In cellular biology it is used to measure the concentrations in living
organisms.[15] In organometallic_chemistry, it is used to evaluate redox
mechanisms.[16]
***** Measuring antioxidant capacity[edit] *****
Cyclical voltammetry can be used to determine the antioxidant capacity in food
and even skin.[17][18] Low molecular weight antioxidants, molecules that
prevent other molecules from being oxidized by acting as reducing agents, are
important in living cells because they inhibit cell damage or death caused by
oxidation reactions that produce radicals.[19] Examples of antioxidants include
flavonoids, whose antioxidant activity is greatly increased with more hydroxyl
groups.[20] Because traditional methods to determine antioxidant capacity
involve tedious steps, techniques to increase the rate of the experiment are
continually being researched. One such technique involves cyclic voltammetry
because it can measure the antioxidant capacity by quickly measuring the redox
behavior over a complex system without the need to measure each component's
antioxidant capacity.[21][22] Furthermore, antioxidants are quickly oxidized at
inert electrodes, so the half-wave potential can be utilized to determine
antioxidant capacity.[23] It is important to note that whenever cyclic
voltammetry is utilized, it is usually compared to spectrophotometry or High
Performance Liquid Chromotography (HPLC).[24] Applications of the technique
extend to food chemistry, where it is used to determine the antioxidant
activity of red wine, chocolate, and hops. Additionally, it even has uses in
the world of medicine in that it can determine antioxidants in the skin.
**** Evaluation of a technique[edit] ****
The technique being evaluated uses voltammetric sensors combined in an
electronic tongue to observe the antioxidant capacity in red wines. These
Electronic_Tongues (ETs) consist of multiple sensing units like voltammetric
sensors, which will have unique responses to certain compounds. This approach
is optimal to use since samples of high complexity can be analyzed with high
cross-selectivity. Thus, the sensors can be sensitive to pH and antioxidants.
As usual, the voltage in the cell was monitored using a working electrode and a
reference electrode (Silver/Silver Chloride electrode).[25] Furthermore, a
platinum counter electrode allows the current to continue to flow during the
experiment. The Carbon Paste Electrodes sensor (CPE) and the Graphite-Epoxy
Composite (GEC) electrode are tested in a saline solution before the scanning
of the wine so that a reference signal can be obtained. The wines are then
ready to be scanned, once with CPE and once with GEC. While cyclic voltammetry
was successfully used to generate currents using the wine samples, the signals
were complex and needed an additional extraction stage.[25] It was found that
the ET method could successfully analyze wine's antioxidant capacity as it
agreed with traditional methods like TEAC, Folin-Ciocalteu, and I280 indexes.
[25] Additionally, the time was reduced, the sample did not have to be
pretreated, and other reagents were unnecessary, all of which diminshed the
popularity of traditional methods.[26] Thus, cyclic voltammetry successfully
determines the antioxidant capacity and even improves previous results.
**** Antioxidant capacity of chocolate and hops[edit] ****
The phenolic antioxidants for cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate
can also be determined via cyclic voltammetry. In order to achieve this, the
anodic peaks are calculated and analyzed with the knowledge that the first and
third anodic peaks can be assigned to the first and second oxidation of
flavonoids, while the second anodic peak represents phenolic acids.[22] Using
the graph produced by cyclic voltammetry, the total phenolic and flavonoid
content can be deduced in each of the three samples. It was observed that cocoa
powder and dark chocolate had the highest antioxidant capacity since they had
high total phenolic and flavonoid content.[22] Milk chocolate had the lowest
capacity as it had the lowest phenolic and flavonoid content.[22] While the
antioxidant content was given using the cyclic voltammetry anodic peaks, HPLC
must then be used to determine the purity of catechins and procyanidin in cocoa
powder, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate. Hops, the flowers used in making
beer, contain antioxidant properties due to the presence of flavonoids and
other polyphenolic compounds.[23] In this cyclic voltammetry experiment, the
working electrode voltage was determined using a ferricinium/ferrocene
reference electrode. By comparing different hop extract samples, it was
observed that the sample containing polyphenols that were oxidized at less
positive potentials proved to have better antioxidant capacity.[23]
