Boron nitride is a thermally and chemically resistant refractory compound of
boron and nitrogen with the chemical_formula BN. It exists in various
crystalline_forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon
lattice. The hexagonal_form corresponding to graphite is the most stable and
soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive
to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite_structure) variety analogous to
diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical
stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to
lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.
Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are
traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has
potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a
structure similar to that of carbon_nanotubes, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets
rolled on themselves, but the properties are very different.

***** Structure[edit] *****
Boron nitride exists in multiple forms that differ in the arrangement of the
boron and nitrogen atoms, giving rise to varying bulk properties of the
material.
**** Amorphous form (a-BN)[edit] ****
The amorphous form of boron nitride (a-BN) is non-crystalline, lacking any
long-distance regularity in the arrangement of its atoms. It is analogous to
amorphous_carbon.
All other forms of boron nitride are crystalline.
**** Hexagonal form (h-BN)[edit] ****
The most stable crystalline form is the hexagonal one, also called h-BN, Î±-BN,
g-BN, and graphitic boron nitride. Hexagonal boron nitride (point group = D6h;
space group = P63/mmc) has a layered structure similar to graphite. Within each
layer, boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong covalent_bonds, whereas the
layers are held together by weak van_der_Waals_forces. The interlayer
"registry" of these sheets differs, however, from the pattern seen for
graphite, because the atoms are eclipsed, with boron atoms lying over and above
nitrogen atoms. This registry reflects the polarity of the BâN bonds. Still,
h-BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the BC6N hybrids have been
synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms.[2]
**** Cubic form (c-BN)[edit] ****
Cubic boron nitride has a crystal structure analogous to that of diamond.
Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less
stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate between the two is
negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the
sphalerite crystal structure, the same as that of diamond, and is also called
Î²-BN or c-BN.
**** Wurtzite form (w-BN)[edit] ****
The wurtzite form of boron nitride (w-BN; point group = C6v; space group =
P63mc) has the same structure as lonsdaleite, a rare hexagonal polymorph of
carbon. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into
tetrahedra.[3] As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped
into 6-membered rings; in the cubic form all rings are in the chair
configuration, in w-BN the rings between 'layers' are in boat_configuration.
The Wurtzite form is thought to be very strong, and was estimated by a
simulation as potentially having a strength 18% stronger than that of diamond,
but because only small amounts of the mineral exist in nature, this has not yet
been experimentally verified.[4]

The partly ionic structure of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and
electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting
in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-
delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a
large band_gap. Very different bonding â strong covalent within the basal
planes (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak
between them â causes high anisotropy of most properties of h-BN.
For example, the hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher
within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties
of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and isotropic.
Those materials are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being
slightly smaller and w-BN even higher than that of diamond.[12] Polycrystalline
c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10 nm is also reported to have Vickers
hardness comparable or higher than diamond.[13] Because of much better
stability to heat and transition metals, c-BN surpasses diamond in mechanical
applications, such as machining steel.[14] The thermal conductivity of BN is
among the highest of all electric insulators (see table).
Boron nitride can be doped p-type with beryllium and n-type with boron, sulfur,
silicon or if co-doped with carbon and nitrogen.[9] Both hexagonal and cubic BN
are wide-gap semiconductors with a band-gap energy corresponding to the UV
region. If voltage is applied to h-BN[15][16] or c-BN,[17] then it emits UV
light in the range 215â250 nm and therefore can potentially be used as light-
emitting_diodes (LEDs) or lasers.
Little is known on melting behavior of boron nitride. It sublimates at 2973 Â°C
at normal pressure releasing nitrogen gas and boron, but melts at elevated
pressure.[18][19]
**** Thermal stability[edit] ****
Hexagonal and cubic (and probably w-BN) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal
stabilities. For example, h-BN is stable to decomposition at temperatures up to
1000 Â°C in air, 1400 Â°C in vacuum, and 2800 Â°C in an inert atmosphere. The
reactivity of h-BN and c-BN is relatively similar, and the data for c-BN are
summarized in the table below.

Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:[9]
    * In air or oxygen: B2O3 protective layer prevents further oxidation to
      ~1300 Â°C; no conversion to hexagonal form at 1400 Â°C.
    * In nitrogen: some conversion to h-BN at 1525 Â°C after 12 h.
    * In vacuum (10â5 Pa): conversion to h-BN at 1550â1600 Â°C.
**** Chemical stability[edit] ****
Boron nitride is insoluble in the usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline
molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na2CO3, NaNO3, Li3N, Mg3N2,
Sr3N2, Ba3N2 or Li3BN2, which are therefore used to etch BN.[9]
**** Thermal conductivity[edit] ****
The theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons
(BNNRs) can approach 1700â2000 W/(mÂ·K), which has the same order of
magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene, and can be
comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons.[20][21]
Moreover, the thermal transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic. The thermal
conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-
edged nanoribbons at room temperature.[22]
***** Natural occurrence[edit] *****
In 2009, a naturally occurring boron nitride mineral in the cubic form (c-BN)
was reported in Tibet, with a proposed name of qingsongite. The substance was
found in dispersed micron-sized inclusions in chromium-rich rocks. In 2013, the
International Mineralogical Association affirmed the mineral and the name.[23]
[24]
***** Synthesis[edit] *****
**** Preparation and reactivity of hexagonal BN[edit] ****
Boron nitride is produced synthetically. Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by
the reacting boron trioxide (B2O3) or boric acid (H3BO3) with ammonia (NH3) or
urea (CO(NH2)2) in a nitrogen atmosphere:[25]
      B2O3 + 2 NH3 â 2 BN + 3 H2O (T = 900 Â°C)
      B(OH)3 + NH3 â BN + 3 H2O (T = 900 Â°C)
      B2O3 + CO(NH2)2 â 2 BN + CO2 + 2 H2O (T > 1000 Â°C)
      B2O3 + 3 CaB6 + 10 N2 â 20 BN + 3 CaO (T > 1500 Â°C)
The resulting disordered (amorphous) boron nitride contains 92â95% BN and
5â8% B2O3. The remaining B2O3 can be evaporated in a second step at
temperatures > 1500 Â°C in order to achieve BN concentration >98%. Such
annealing also crystallizes BN, the size of the crystallites increasing with
the annealing temperature.[14][26]
h-BN parts can be fabricated inexpensively by hot-pressing with subsequent
machining. The parts are made from boron nitride powders adding boron oxide for
better compressibility. Thin films of boron nitride can be obtained by chemical
vapor_deposition from boron_trichloride and nitrogen precursors.[27] Combustion
of boron powder in nitrogen plasma at 5500 Â°C yields ultrafine boron nitride
used for lubricants and toners.[28]
Boron nitride reacts with iodine_fluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at
â30 Â°C to produce an extremely sensitive contact_explosive, NI3, in low
yield.[29] Boron nitride reacts with nitrides of alkali metals and lanthanides
to form nitridoborate compounds.[30] For example:
      Li3N + BN â Li3BN2
**** Intercalation of hexagonal BN[edit] ****
See also: Graphite_intercalation_compound
Structure of hexagonal boron nitride intercalated with potassium (B4N4K)
Similar to graphite, various molecules, such as NH3[31] or alkali metals,[32]
can be intercalated into hexagonal boron nitride, that is inserted between its
layers. Both experiment and theory suggest the intercalation is much more
difficult for BN than for graphite.[33]
**** Preparation of cubic BN[edit] ****
Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is
produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature,
much as synthetic_diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of
hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures
between 5 and 18 GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230 Â°C, that is
similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion.[34] The addition
of a small amount of boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4â7 GPa
and temperature to 1500 Â°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the
conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium,
potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with
ammonium compounds, or hydrazine.[35][36] Other industrial synthesis methods,
again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature
gradient, or explosive shock_wave. The shock wave method is used to produce
material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and
nitrogen.[37]
Low-pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in
diamond growth, the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases
(h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by
adding hydrogen gas, boron_trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion_beam_deposition,
plasma-enhanced_chemical_vapor_deposition, pulsed_laser_deposition, reactive
sputtering, and other physical_vapor_deposition methods are used as well.[27]
**** Preparation of wurtzite BN[edit] ****
Wurtzite BN can be obtained via static high-pressure or dynamic shock methods.
[38] The limits of its stability are not well defined. Both c-BN and w-BN are
formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much lower
temperatures close to 1700 Â°C.[35]
**** Production statistics[edit] ****
Whereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for
BN synthesis, namely boric acid and boron trioxide, are well known (see boron),
the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical
reports. An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons.
The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States,
Japan, China and Germany. In 2000, prices varied from about $75/kg to $120/kg
for standard industrial-quality h-BN and were about up to $200â$400/kg for
high purity BN grades.[25]
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Hexagonal BN[edit] ****
Main article: Synthesis_of_hexagonal_boron_nitride
Ceramic BN crucible
Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is the most widely used polymorph. It is a good lubricant
at both low and high temperatures (up to 900 Â°C, even in an oxidizing
atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical
conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would
be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity
does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore,
h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The
lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints,
dental_cements, and pencil leads.[39]
Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in Japan. However, because
of its high price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application. Its use was
revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes,
and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products
for foundations, make-up, eye_shadows, blushers, kohl_pencils, lipsticks and
other skincare products.[14]
Because of its excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics
are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be
included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials,
giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for
construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking.[14] Plastics filled with BN
have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and
electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties,
BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-
transparent windows and as a structural material for seals.[40] It can also be
used as dielectric in resistive random access memories.[41][42]
Hexagonal BN is used in xerographic_process and laser_printers as a charge
leakage barrier layer of the photo drum.[43] In the automotive industry, h-BN
mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing oxygen_sensors, which
provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique
temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.[14]
Parts can be made by hot_pressing from four commercial grades of h-BN. Grade
HBN contains a boron_oxide binder; it is usable up to 550â850 Â°C in
oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600 Â°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide
content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a calcium_borate binder and is
usable at 1600 Â°C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder and can be used up to
3000 Â°C.[44]
Boron_nitride_nanosheets (h-BN) can be deposited by catalytic decomposition of
borazine at a temperature ~1100 Â°C in a chemical_vapor_deposition setup, over
areas up to about 10 cm2. Owing to their hexagonal atomic structure, small
lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), and high uniformity they are used as
substrates for graphene-based devices.[45] BN nanosheets are also excellent
proton_conductors. Their high proton transport rate, combined with the high
electrical resistance, may lead to applications in fuel_cells and water
electrolysis.[46]
h-BN has been used since the mid-2000s as a bullet and bore lubricant in
precision target rifle applications as an alternative to molybdenum_disulfide
coating, commonly referred to as "moly". It is claimed to increase effective
barrel life, increase intervals between bore cleaning, and decrease the
deviation in point of impact between clean bore first shots and subsequent
shots.[47]
**** Cubic boron nitride[edit] ****
Cubic boron nitride (CBN or c-BN) is widely used as an abrasive.[48] Its
usefulness arises from its insolubility in iron, nickel, and related alloys at
high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals. Polycrystalline
c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond
abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in
contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a passivation layer of boron
oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of
metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are
often used in the tool_bits of cutting_tools. For grinding applications, softer
binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic
binders can be used as well. Commercial products are known under names
"Borazon" (by Diamond Innovations), and "Elbor" or "Cubonite" (by Russian
vendors).[39]
Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be produced in a simple process
(called sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures
slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN
powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.[39]
Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and
electrical resistivity is ideal for heat_spreaders.
As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically
and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low
mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow
usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.[49]
**** Amorphous boron nitride[edit] ****
Layers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some semiconductor
devices, e.g. MOSFETs. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of
trichloroborazine with caesium, or by thermal chemical vapor deposition
methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high
temperatures, c-BN.[50]
***** Other forms of boron nitride[edit] *****
**** Atomically thin boron nitride[edit] ****
Hexagonal boron nitride can be exfoliated to mono or few atomic layer sheets.
Due to its analogous structure to that of graphene but white appearance,
atomically thin boron nitride is sometimes call âwhite grapheneâ.[51]
Mechanical properties. Atomically thin boron nitride is one of the strongest
electrically insulating materials. Monolayer boron nitride has an average
Young's modulus of 0.865TPa and fracture strength of 70.5GPa, and in contrast
to graphene, whose strength decreases dramatically with increased thickness,
few-layer boron nitride sheets have a strength similar to that of monolayer
boron nitride.[52]
Thermal conductivity. Atomically thin boron nitride has one of the highest
thermal conductivity coefficients (751 W/mK at room temperature) among
semiconductors and electrical insulators, and its thermal conductivity
increases with reduced thickness due to less intra-layer coupling.[53]
Thermal stability. The air stability of graphene shows a clear thickness
dependence: monolayer graphene is reactive to oxygen at 250 Â°C, strongly doped
at 300 Â°C, and etched at 450 Â°C; in contrast, bulk graphite is not oxidized
until 800 Â°C.[54] Atomically thin boron nitride has much better oxidation
resistance than graphene. Monolayer boron nitride is not oxidized till 700 Â°C
and can sustain up to 850 Â°C in air; bilayer and trilayer boron nitride
nanosheets have slightly higher oxidation starting temperatures.[55] The
excellent thermal stability, high impermeability to gas and liquid, and
electrical insulation make atomically thin boron nitride potential coating
materials for preventing surface oxidation and corrosion of metals[56][57] and
other two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as black phosphorus.[58]
Better surface adsorption. Atomically thin boron nitride has been found to have
better surface adsorption capabilities than bulk hexagonal boron nitride.[59]
According to theoretical and experimental studies, atomically thin boron
nitride as an adsorbent experiences conformational changes upon surface
adsorption of molecules, increasing adsorption energy and efficiency. The
synergic effect of the atomic thickness, high flexibility, stronger surface
adsorption capability, electrical insulation, impermeability, high thermal and
chemical stability of BN nanosheets can increase the Raman sensitivity by up to
two orders, and in the meantime attain long-term stability and extraordinary
reusability not achievable by other materials.[60][61]
Dielectric properties. Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride is an excellent
dielectric substrate for graphene, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), and many other
2D material-based electronic and photonic devices. As shown by electric force
microscopy (EFM) studies, the electric field screening in atomically thin boron
nitride shows a weak dependence on thickness, which is in line with the smooth
decay of electric field inside few-layer boron nitride revealed by the first-
principles calculations.[54]
Raman characteristics. Raman spectroscopy has been a useful tool to study a
variety of 2D materials, and the Raman signature of high-quality atomically
thin boron nitride was first reported by Gorbachev et al.[62] and Li et al.[55]
However, the two reported Raman results of monolayer boron nitride did not
agree with each other. Cai et al., therefore, conducted systematic experimental
and theoretical studies to reveal the intrinsic Raman spectrum of atomically
thin boron nitride.[63] It reveals that atomically thin boron nitride without
interaction with a substrate has a G band frequency similar to that of bulk
hexagonal boron nitride, but strain induced by the substrate can cause Raman
shifts. Nevertheless, the Raman intensity of G band of atomically thin boron
nitride can be used to estimate layer thickness and sample quality.

**** Boron nitride nanomesh[edit] ****
Main article: Nanomesh
Boron_nitride_nanomesh is a nanostructured two-dimensional material. It
consists of a single BN layer, which forms by self-assembly a highly regular
mesh after high-temperature exposure of a clean rhodium[65] or ruthenium[66]
surface to borazine under ultra-high_vacuum. The nanomesh looks like an
assembly of hexagonal pores. The distance between two pore centers is 3.2 nm
and the pore diameter is ~2 nm. Other terms for this material are boronitrene
or white graphene.[67]
The boron nitride nanomesh is not only stable to decomposition under vacuum,
[65] air[68] and some liquids,[69][70] but also up to temperatures of 800 Â°C.
[65] In addition, it shows the extraordinary ability to trap molecules[69] and
metallic clusters[66] which have similar sizes to the nanomesh pores, forming a
well-ordered array. These characteristics promise interesting applications of
the nanomesh in areas like catalysis, surface_functionalisation, spintronics,
quantum_computing and data storage media like hard_drives.[71]
BN nanotubes are flame resistant, as shown in this comparative test of
airplanes made of cellullose, carbon buckypaper and BN nanotube buckypaper.[72]
**** Boron nitride nanotubes[edit] ****
Main article: Boron_nitride_nanotube
Boron nitride tubules were first made in 1989 by Shore and Dolan This work was
patented in 1989 and published in 1989 thesis (Dolan) and then 1993 Science.
The 1989 work was also the first preparation of amorphous BN by B-
trichloroborazine and cesium metal.

science.260.5108.659 Boron nitride nanotubes were predicted in 1994[73] and
experimentally discovered in 1995.[74] They can be imagined as a rolled up
sheet of h-boron nitride. Structurally, it is a close analog of the carbon
nanotube, namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers
and length of many micrometers, except carbon atoms are alternately substituted
by nitrogen and boron atoms. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very
different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending
on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator
with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and
morphology.[75] In addition, a layered BN structure is much more thermally and
chemically stable than a graphitic carbon structure.[76][77]
**** Boron nitride aerogel[edit] ****
Main article: Boron_nitride_aerogel
Boron nitride aerogel is an aerogel made of highly porous BN. It typically
consists of a mixture of deformed BN nanotubes and nanosheets. It can have a
density as low as 0.6 mg/cm3 and a specific surface area as high as 1050 m2/g,
and therefore has potential applications as an absorbent, catalyst support and
gas storage medium. BN aerogels are highly hydrophobic and can absorb up to 160
times their weight in oil. They are resistant to oxidation in air at
temperatures up to 1200 Â°C, and hence can be reused after the absorbed oil is
burned out by flame. BN aerogels can be prepared by template-assisted chemical
vapor_deposition using borazine as the feed gas.[64]
**** Composites containing BN[edit] ****
Addition of boron nitride to silicon_nitride ceramics improves the thermal
shock resistance of the resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added
also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium_nitride-alumina ceramics. Other
materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate
glasses, glass_ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium_boride-
boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium_nitride-boron nitride, and silicon
carbide-boron nitride composition.[78]
***** Health issues[edit] *****
Boron nitride (along with Si3N4, NbN, and BNC) is reported to show weak
fibrogenic activity, and to cause pneumoconiosis when inhaled in particulate
form. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10 mg/
m3 for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.[9]
