Iron (/ËaÉªÉrn/) is a chemical_element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum)
and atomic_number 26. It is a metal, that belongs to the first_transition
series and group_8 of the periodic_table. It is by mass the most common element
on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner_core. It is the fourth most
common element_in_the_Earth's_crust.
Pure iron is very rare on the Earth's crust, basically being limited to
meteorites. Iron_ores are quite abundant, but extracting usable metal from them
requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1500 Â°C or higher, about
500 Â°C higher than what is enough to smelt copper. Humans started to dominate
that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE[not_verified_in_body], and iron
began to displace copper_alloys for tools and weapons, in some regions, only
around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze_Age to
the Iron_Age. Iron alloys, such as steel, inox, and special_steels are now by
far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties
and their low cost.
Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However,
iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron
oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that
form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus
flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.
The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron,
mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. These two proteins play essential roles in
vertebrate metabolism, respectively oxygen_transport by blood and oxygen
storage in muscles. To maintain the necessary levels, human_iron_metabolism
requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active
site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular_respiration and
oxidation_and_reduction in plants and animals.[8]
Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron
(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition_metals, including the
other group_8_elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron forms compounds in a wide
range of oxidation_states, â2 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination
compounds; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian_blue,
have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.

***** Characteristics *****
**** Allotropes ****
Main article: Allotropes_of_iron
Molar volume vs. pressure for Î± iron at room temperature
At least four allotropes of iron (different atom arrangements in the solid) are
known, conventionally denoted Î±, Î³, Î´, and Îµ.
Low-pressure phase_diagram of pure iron
The first three forms are observed at ordinary pressures. As molten iron cools
past its freezing point of 1538 Â°C, it crystallizes into its Î´ allotrope,
which has a body-centered_cubic (bcc) crystal_structure. As it cools further to
1394 Â°C, it changes to its Î³-iron allotrope, a face-centered_cubic (fcc)
crystal structure, or austenite. At 912 Â°C and below, the crystal structure
again becomes the bcc Î±-iron allotrope.[9]
The physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have
also been studied extensively, because of their relevance to theories about the
cores of the Earth and other planets. Above approximately 10 GPa and
temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, Î±-iron changes into another
hexagonal_close-packed (hcp) structure, which is also known as Îµ-iron. The
higher-temperature Î³-phase also changes into Îµ-iron, but does so at higher
pressure.
Some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable Î² phase at
pressures above 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K. It is supposed to
have an orthorhombic or a double hcp structure.[10] (Confusingly, the term "Î²-
iron" is sometimes also used to refer to Î±-iron above its Curie point, when it
changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic, even though its crystal
structure has not changed.[9])
The inner_core of the Earth is generally presumed to consist of an iron-nickel
alloy with Îµ (or Î²) structure.[11]
**** Melting and boiling points ****
The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy_of_atomization,
are lower than those of the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium,
showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as
they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus;[12]
however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese
because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-
electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but
not osmium.[13]
The melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures less
than 50 GPa. For greater pressures, published data (as of 2007) still varies by
tens of gigapascals and over a thousand kelvin.[14]
**** Magnetic properties ****

steel, 2. Silicon steel, 3. Cast steel, 4. Tungsten steel, 5. Magnet steel,
6. Cast iron, 7. Nickel, 8. Cobalt, 9. Magnetite[15]
Below its Curie_point of 770 Â°C, Î±-iron changes from paramagnetic to
ferromagnetic: the spins of the two unpaired electrons in each atom generally
align with the spins of its neighbors, creating an overall magnetic_field.[16]
This happens because the orbitals of those two electrons (dz2 and dx2 â y2)
do not point toward neighboring atoms in the lattice, and therefore are not
involved in metallic bonding.[9]
In the absence of an external source of magnetic field, the atoms get
spontaneously partitioned into magnetic_domains, about 10 micrometers across,
[17] such that the atoms in each domain have parallel spins, but different
domains have other orientations. Thus a macroscopic piece of iron will have a
nearly zero overall magnetic field.
Application of an external magnetic field causes the domains that are
magnetized in the same general direction to grow at the expense of adjacent
ones that point in other directions, reinforcing the external field. This
effect is exploited in devices that needs to channel magnetic fields, such as
electrical_transformers, magnetic_recording heads, and electric_motors.
Impurities, lattice_defects, or grain and particle boundaries can "pin" the
domains in the new positions, so that the effect persists even after the
external field is removed -- thus turning the iron object into a (permanent)
magnet.[16]
Similar behavior is exhibited by some iron compounds, such as the ferrites and
the mineral magnetite, a crystalline form of the mixed iron(II,III) oxide Fe
3O
4 (although the atomic-scale mechanism, ferrimagnetism, is somewhat different).
Pieces of magnetite with natural permanent magnetization (lodestones) provided
the earliest compasses for navigation. Particles of magnetite were extensively
used in magnetic recording media such as core_memories, magnetic_tapes,
floppies, and disks, until they were replaced by cobalt-based materials.
**** Isotopes ****
Main article: isotopes_of_iron
Iron has four stable isotopes: 54Fe (5.845% of natural iron), 56Fe (91.754%),
57Fe (2.119%) and 58Fe (0.282%). 20-30 artificial isotopes have also been
created. Of these stable isotopes, only 57Fe has a nuclear_spin
(â&#x200b;1⁄2). The nuclide 54Fe theoretically can undergo double_electron
capture to 54Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit
on the half-life of 3.1Ã1022 years has been established.[18]
60Fe is an extinct_radionuclide of long half-life (2.6 million years).[19] It
is not found on Earth, but its ultimate decay product is its granddaughter, the
stable nuclide 60Ni.[18] Much of the past work on isotopic composition of iron
has focused on the nucleosynthesis of 60Fe through studies of meteorites and
ore formation. In the last decade, advances in mass_spectrometry have allowed
the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in
the ratios of the stable_isotopes of iron. Much of this work is driven by the
Earth and planetary_science communities, although applications to biological
and industrial systems are emerging.[20]
In phases of the meteorites Semarkona and Chervony Kut, a correlation between
the concentration of 60Ni, the granddaughter of 60Fe, and the abundance of the
stable iron isotopes provided evidence for the existence of 60Fe at the time of
formation_of_the_Solar_System. Possibly the energy released by the decay of
60Fe, along with that released by 26Al, contributed to the remelting and
differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The
abundance of 60Ni present in extraterrestrial material may bring further
insight into the origin and early history of the Solar_System.[21]
The most abundant iron isotope 56Fe is of particular interest to nuclear
scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis.
[22] Since 56Ni (14 alpha_particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in
the alpha_process in nuclear_reactions in supernovae (see silicon_burning
process), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely_massive_stars,
since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires a great
deal more energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is created
in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron
emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova_remnant gas cloud,
first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is the most
abundant element in the core of red_giants, and is the most abundant metal in
iron_meteorites and in the dense metal cores_of_planets such as Earth.[23] It
is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of
approximately the same atomic_weight.[23][24] Iron is the sixth most abundant
element in the Universe, and the most common refractory element.[25]
Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing 62Ni,
which has a marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are
unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution
on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a
lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons.
[26] Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation,
involving rapid_neutron_capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.[23]
In the far_future of the universe, assuming that proton_decay does not occur,
cold fusion occurring via quantum_tunnelling would cause the light nuclei in
ordinary matter to fuse into 56Fe nuclei. Fission and alpha-particle_emission
would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass
objects to cold spheres of pure iron.[27]
***** Origin and occurrence in nature *****
**** Cosmogenesis ****
Iron's abundance in rocky_planets like Earth is due to its abundant production
by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with
release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters
the iron into space.
**** Metallic iron ****

Metallic or native_iron is rarely found on the surface of the Earth because it
tends to oxidize. However, both the Earth's inner and outer_core, that account
for 35% of the mass of the whole Earth, are believed to consist largely of an
iron alloy, possibly with nickel. Electric currents in the liquid outer core
are believed to be the origin of the Earth's_magnetic_field. The other
terrestrial_planets (Mercury, Venus, and Mars) as well as the Moon and are
believed to have a metallic core consisting mostly of iron. The M-type
asteroids are also believed to be partly or mostly made of metallic iron alloy.
The rare iron_meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the
Earth's surface. Items made of cold-worked meteoritic iron have been found in
various archaeological sites dating from a time when iron smelting had not yet
been developed; and the Inuit in Greenland have been reported to use iron from
the Cape_York_meteorite for tools and hunting weapons.[28] About 1 in 20
meteorites consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals taenite (35â80% iron)
and kamacite (90â95% iron).[29]
**** Mantle minerals ****
Ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O, a solid solution of periclase (MgO) and wÃ¼stite
(FeO), makes up about 20% of the volume of the lower_mantle of the Earth, which
makes it the second most abundant mineral phase in that region after silicate
perovskite (Mg,Fe)SiO3; it also is the major host for iron in the lower mantle.
[30] At the bottom of the transition_zone of the mantle, the reaction Î³-
(Mg,Fe)2[SiO4] â (Mg,Fe)[SiO3] + (Mg,Fe)O transforms Î³-olivine into a
mixture of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase and vice versa. In the
literature, this mineral phase of the lower mantle is also often called
magnesiowÃ¼stite.[31] Silicate_perovskite may form up to 93% of the lower
mantle,[32] and the magnesium iron form, (Mg,Fe)SiO3, is considered to be the
most abundant mineral in the Earth, making up 38% of its volume.[33]
**** Earth's crust ****
Ochre path in Roussillon.
While iron the most abundant element on Earth, it accounts for only 5% of the
Earth's_crust; thus being only the fourth most abundant element, after oxygen,
silicon, and aluminium.[34]
Most of the iron in the crust is combined with various other elements to form
many different iron_minerals. An important class is the iron_oxide minerals
such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3), which are
the major ores_of_iron. Many igneous_rocks also contain the sulfide minerals
pyrrhotite and pentlandite.[35][36] During weathering, iron tends to leach from
sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate.
Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly
elevated pH as iron(III)_oxide.[37]
Banded iron formation in the McKinley_Park,_Minnesota, Minnesota.
Large deposits of iron are banded_iron_formations, a type of rock consisting of
repeated thin layers of iron oxides alternating with bands of iron-poor shale
and chert. The banded iron formations were laid down in the time between
3,700 million years ago and 1,800 million years ago.[38][39]
Materials containing finely ground iron(III) oxides or oxide-hydroxides, such
as ochre, have been used as yellow, red, and brown pigments since pre-
historical times. They contribute as well to the color of various rocks and
clays, including entire geological formations like the Painted_Hills in Oregon
and the Buntsandstein ("colored sandstone", British Bunter).[40] Through
Eisensandstein (a jurassic 'iron sandstone', e.g. from Donzdorf) in Germany[41]
and Bath_stone in the UK, iron compounds are responsible for the yellowish
color of many historical buildings and sculptures.[42] The proverbial red_color
of_the_surface_of_Mars is derived from an iron oxide-rich regolith.[43]
Significant amounts of iron occur in the iron sulfide mineral pyrite (FeS2),
but it is difficult to extract iron from it and it is therefore not exploited.
In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with
very high quantities of it.
According to the International_Resource_Panel's Metal_Stocks_in_Society_report,
the global stock of iron in use in society is 2200 kg per capita. More-
developed countries differ in this respect from less-developed countries
(7000â14000 vs 2000 kg per capita).[44]

Iron shows the characteristic chemical properties of the transition_metals,
namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one
and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the
discovery of an iron compound, ferrocene, that revolutionalized the latter
field in the 1950s.[45] Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the
entire block of transition metals, due to its abundance and the immense role it
has played in the technological progress of humanity.[46] Its 26 electrons are
arranged in the configuration [Ar]3d64s2, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are
relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons
and there is no clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable.[13]
Iron forms compounds mainly in the oxidation_states +2 (iron(II), "ferrous")
and +3 (iron(III), "ferric"). Iron also occurs in higher_oxidation_states, e.g.
the purple potassium_ferrate (K2FeO4), which contains iron in its +6 oxidation
state. Although iron(VIII) oxide (FeO4) has been claimed, the report could not
be reproduced and such a species (at least with iron in its +8 oxidation state)
has been found to be improbable computationally.[47] However, one form of
anionic [FeO4]â with iron in its +7 oxidation state, along with an iron(V)-
peroxo isomer, has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at 4 K after
cocondensation of laser-ablated Fe atoms with a mixture of O2/Ar.[48] Iron(IV)
is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions.[49][50]
Numerous organoiron compounds contain formal oxidation states of +1, 0, â1,
or even â2. The oxidation states and other bonding properties are often
assessed using the technique of MÃ¶ssbauer_spectroscopy.[51] Many mixed_valence
compounds contain both iron(II) and iron(III) centers, such as magnetite and
Prussian_blue (Fe4(Fe[CN]6)3).[50] The latter is used as the traditional "blue"
in blueprints.[52]
Iron is the first of the transition metals that cannot reach its group
oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can,
with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium.[9] Ruthenium exhibits an
aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron,
but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic
complexes.[9] In the second half of the 3d transition series, vertical
similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron
with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table, which are also
ferromagnetic at room_temperature and share similar chemistry. As such, iron,
cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron_triad.[46]
Unlike many other metals, iron does not form amalgams with mercury. As a
result, mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks (34 kg) made of iron.
[53]
Iron is by far the most reactive element in its group; it is pyrophoric when
finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it
does not react with concentrated nitric_acid and other oxidizing acids due to
the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with
hydrochloric_acid.[9]

Iron forms various oxide_and_hydroxide_compounds; the most common are iron
(II,III)_oxide (Fe3O4), and iron(III)_oxide (Fe2O3). Iron(II)_oxide also
exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they
are actually all non-stoichiometric_compounds whose compositions may vary.[54]
These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see bloomery
and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of ferrites, useful
magnetic_storage media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is
iron_pyrite (FeS2), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster.[50]
It is not an iron(IV) compound, but is actually an iron(II) polysulfide
containing Fe2+ and S2â
2 ions in a distorted sodium_chloride structure.[54]

Hydrated iron(III) chloride (ferric chloride)
The binary ferrous and ferric halides are well-known. The ferrous halides
typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding hydrohalic_acid
to give the corresponding hydrated salts.[50]
      Fe + 2 HX â FeX2 + H2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I)
Iron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to give the corresponding
ferric halides, ferric_chloride being the most common.[55]
      2 Fe + 3 X2 â 2 FeX3 (X = F, Cl, Br)
Ferric iodide is an exception, being thermodynamically unstable due to the
oxidizing power of Fe3+ and the high reducing power of Iâ:[55]
      2 Iâ + 2 Fe3+ â I2 + 2 Fe2+ (E0 = +0.23 V)
Ferric iodide, a black solid, is not stable in ordinary conditions, but can be
prepared through the reaction of iron_pentacarbonyl with iodine and carbon
monoxide in the presence of hexane and light at the temperature of â20 Â°C,
with oxygen and water excluded.[55]
**** Solution chemistry ****
Comparison of colors of solutions of ferrate (left) and permanganate (right)
The standard_reduction_potentials in acidic aqueous solution for some common
iron ions are given below:[9]
Fe2+ + 2 eâ  â Fe        E0 = â0.447 V
Fe3+ + 3 eâ  â Fe        E0 = â0.037 V

The red-purple tetrahedral ferrate(VI) anion is such a strong oxidizing agent
that it oxidizes nitrogen and ammonia at room temperature, and even water
itself in acidic or neutral solutions:[55]

      4 + 10 H
      2O â 4 Fe3+
       + 20 OHâ
       + 3 O2
The Fe3+ ion has a large simple cationic chemistry, although the pale-violet
hexaquo ion [Fe(H2O)6]3+ is very readily hydrolyzed when pH increases above 0
as follows:[56]
[Fe(H2O)6]3+     â [Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+ + K = 10â3.05 mol dmâ3
[Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+ â [Fe(H2O)4(OH)2]+ + K = 10â3.26 mol dmâ3

                 2 + 2 H+ + 2 H2O
Blue-green iron(II)_sulfate heptahydrate
As pH rises above 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form and as it rises
above 2â3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III)_oxide precipitates out of
solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not
like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden dâd bands, because Fe3+ has
higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its
ligand-to-metal charge_transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are
rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion â and
even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet
region.[56] On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion [Fe(H2O)6]2+
does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when
carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II)_carbonate
being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly
soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises
quickly in air to form iron(III)_oxide that accounts for the brown deposits
present in a sizeable number of streams.[57]
**** Coordination compounds ****
Due to its electronic structure, iron has a very large coordination and
organometallic chemistry.
The two enantiomorphs of the ferrioxalate ion
Many coordination compounds of iron are known. A typical six-coordinate anion
is hexachloroferrate(III), [FeCl6]3â, found in the mixed salt tetrakis
(methylammonium)_hexachloroferrate(III)_chloride.[58][59] Complexes with
multiple bidentate ligands have geometric_isomers. For example, the trans-
chlorohydridobis(bis-1,2-(diphenylphosphino)ethane)iron(II) complex is used as
a starting material for compounds with the Fe(dppe)2 moiety.[60][61] The
ferrioxalate ion with three oxalate ligands (shown at right) displays helical
chirality with its two non-superposable geometries labelled Î (lambda) for the
left-handed screw axis and Î (delta) for the right-handed screw axis, in line
with IUPAC conventions.[56] Potassium_ferrioxalate is used in chemical
actinometry and along with its sodium_salt undergoes photoreduction applied in
old-style photographic processes. The dihydrate of iron(II)_oxalate has a
polymeric structure with co-planar oxalate ions bridging between iron centres
with the water of crystallisation located forming the caps of each octahedron,
as illustrated below.[62]
Crystal structure of iron(II) oxalate dihydrate, showing iron (gray), oxygen
(red), carbon (black), and hydrogen (white) atoms.
Blood-red positive thiocyanate test for iron(III)
Iron(III) complexes are quite similar to those of chromium(III) with the
exception of iron(III)'s preference for O-donor instead of N-donor ligands. The
latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron(II) complexes and often
dissociate in water. Many FeâO complexes show intense colors and are used as
tests for phenols or enols. For example, in the ferric_chloride_test, used to
determine the presence of phenols, iron(III)_chloride reacts with a phenol to
form a deep violet complex:[56]
      3 ArOH + FeCl3 â Fe(OAr)3 + 3 HCl (Ar = aryl)
Among the halide and pseudohalide complexes, fluoro complexes of iron(III) are
the most stable, with the colorless [FeF5(H2O)]2â being the most stable in
aqueous solution. Chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral
coordination as in [FeCl4]â; [FeBr4]â and [FeI4]â are reduced easily to
iron(II). Thiocyanate is a common test for the presence of iron(III) as it
forms the blood-red [Fe(SCN)(H2O)5]2+. Like manganese(II), most iron(III)
complexes are high-spin, the exceptions being those with ligands that are high
in the spectrochemical_series such as cyanide. An example of a low-spin iron
(III) complex is [Fe(CN)6]3â. The cyanide ligands may easily be detached in
[Fe(CN)6]3â, and hence this complex is poisonous, unlike the iron(II) complex
[Fe(CN)6]4â found in Prussian blue,[56] which does not release hydrogen
cyanide except when dilute acids are added.[57] Iron shows a great variety of
electronic spin_states, including every possible spin quantum number value for
a d-block element from 0 (diamagnetic) to &#x200b;5⁄2 (5 unpaired electrons).
This value is always half the number of unpaired electrons. Complexes with zero
to two unpaired electrons are considered low-spin and those with four or five
are considered high-spin.[54]
Iron(II) complexes are less stable than iron(III) complexes but the preference
for O-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example [Fe(NH3)6]2+ is known
while [Fe(NH3)6]3+ is not. They have a tendency to be oxidized to iron(III) but
this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used.[57]
**** Organometallic compounds ****
Iron penta-
carbonyl.
Organoiron_chemistry is the study of organometallic_compounds of iron, where
carbon atoms are covalently bound to the metal atom. They are many and varied,
including cyanide_complexes, carbonyl_complexes, sandwich and half-sandwich
compounds.
Prussian blue.
Prussian_blue or "ferric ferrocyanide", Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3, is an old and well-known
iron-cyanide complex, extensively used as pigment and in several other
applications. Its formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to
distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ as they react
(respectively) with potassium_ferricyanide and potassium_ferrocyanide to form
Prussian blue.[50]
Another old example of organoiron compound is iron_pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO)5, in
which a neutral iron atom is bound to the carbon atoms of five carbon_monoxide
molecules. The compound can be used to make carbonyl_iron powder, a highly
reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives triiron
dodecacarbonyl, Fe
3(CO)
12, a with a cluster of three iron atoms at its core. Collman's reagent,
disodium_tetracarbonylferrate, is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it
contains iron in the â2 oxidation state. Cyclopentadienyliron_dicarbonyl
dimer contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state.[63]
Structural formula of ferrocene, and a powdered sample.
A landmark in this field was the discovery in 1951 of the remarkably stable
sandwich_compound ferrocene Fe(C
5H
5)
2, by] Paulson and Kealy[64] and independently by Miller and others,[65] whose
surprising molecular structure was determined only a year later by Woodward and
Wilkinson[66] and Fischer.[67] Ferrocene is still one of the most important
tools and models in this class.[68]
Iron-centered organometallic species are used as catalysts. The KnÃ¶lker
complex, for example, is a transfer_hydrogenation catalyst for ketones.[69]
**** Industrial uses ****
The iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are iron(II)
sulfate (FeSO4Â·7H2O) and iron(III)_chloride (FeCl3). The former is one of the
most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial
oxidation than Mohr's_salt ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2Â·6H2O). Iron(II) compounds tend to
be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.[50]
***** Etymology *****
"iren," an Old English word for 'iron'
As iron has been in use for such a long time, it has many different names in
different languages. The source of its chemical symbol Fe is the Latin word
ferrum, and its descendants are the names of the element in the Romance
languages (for example, French fer, Spanish hierro, and Italian and Portuguese
ferro).[70] The word ferrum itself possibly comes from the Semitic_languages,
via Etruscan, from a root that also gave rise to Old_English brÃ¦s "brass".[71]
The English word iron derives ultimately from Proto-Germanic *isarnan, which is
also the source of the German name Eisen. It was most likely borrowed from
Celtic *isarnon, which ultimately comes from Proto-Indo-European *is-(e)ro-
"powerful, holy" and finally *eis "strong", referencing iron's strength as a
metal.[72] Kluge relates *isarnon to Illyric and Latin ira, 'wrath').[citation
needed] The Balto-Slavic names for iron (e.g. Russian Ð¶ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ·Ð¾ [zhelezo],
Polish Å¼elazo, Lithuanian geleÅ¾is) are the only ones to come directly from
the Proto-Indo-European *ghelgh- "iron".[73] In many of these languages, the
word for iron may also be used to denote other objects made of iron or steel,
or figuratively because of the hardness and strength of the metal.[74] The
Chinese tiÄ (traditional éµ; simplified é) derives from Proto-Sino-Tibetan
*hliek,[75] and was borrowed into Japanese as é tetsu, which also has the
native reading kurogane "black metal" (similar to how iron is referenced in the
English word blacksmith).[76]
***** History *****
Main article: History_of_ferrous_metallurgy
**** Development of iron metallurgy ****
Iron is one of the elements undoubtedly known to the ancient world.[77] It has
been worked, or wrought, for millennia. However, iron objects of great age are
much rarer than objects made of gold or silver due to the ease with which iron
corrodes.[78] The technology developed slowly, and even after the discovery of
smelting it took many centuries for iron to replace bronze as the metal of
choice for tools and weapons.
*** Meteoritic iron ***
Iron harpoon head from Greenland. The iron edge covers a narwhaltusk harpoon
using meteorite iron from the Cape_York_meteorite, one of the largest iron
meteorites known.
Beads made from meteoric_iron in 3500 BC or earlier were found in Gerzah, Egypt
by G.A. Wainwright.[79] The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of
meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only
minuscule nickel impurities.
Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was
often used to forge weapons and tools.[79] For example, a dagger made of
meteoric iron was found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar
proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area,
deposited by an ancient meteor shower.[80][81][82] Items that were likely made
of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500 BC.[78]
Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily cold_forged but may
get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.[83]

The iron_pillar_of_Delhi is an example of the iron extraction and processing
methodologies of early India.
The first iron production started in the Middle_Bronze_Age but it took several
centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar,
Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between
3000 and 2700 BC.[84] The Hittites established an empire in north-central
Anatolia around 1600 BC. They appear to be the first to understand the
production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society.[85] The
Hittites began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200 BC and the practice spread
to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180 BC.[84] The
subsequent period is called the Iron_Age.
Artifacts of smelted iron are found in India dating from 1800 to 1200 BC,[86]
and in the Levant from about 1500 BC (suggesting smelting in Anatolia or the
Caucasus).[87][88] Alleged references (compare history_of_metallurgy_in_South
Asia) to iron in the Indian Vedas have been used for claims of a very early
usage of iron in India respectively to date the texts as such. The rigveda term
ayas (metal) probably refers to copper and bronze, while iron or ÅyÄma ayas,
literally "black metal", first is mentioned in the post-rigvedic Atharvaveda.
[89]
Some archaeological evidence suggests iron was smelted in Zimbabwe and
southeast Africa as early as the eighth century BC.[90] Iron working was
introduced to Greece in the late 11th century BC, from which it spread quickly
throughout Europe.[91]
Iron sickle from Ancient Greece.
The spread of ironworking in Central and Western Europe is associated with
Celtic expansion. According to Pliny_the_Elder, iron use was common in the
Roman era.[79] The annual iron output of the Roman_Empire is estimated at 84750
t,[92] while the similarly populous and contemporary Han China produced around
5000 t.[93] In China, iron only appears circa 700â500 BC.[94] Iron smelting
may have been introduced into China through Central Asia.[95] The earliest
evidence of the use of a blast_furnace in China dates to the 1st century AD,
[96] and cupola furnaces were used as early as the Warring_States_period
(403â221 BC).[97] Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread
during the Song and Tang_Dynasties.[98]
During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry_Cort began refining iron
from pig_iron to wrought_iron (or bar iron) using innovative production
systems. In 1783 he patented the puddling_process for refining iron ore. It was
later improved by others, including Joseph_Hall.[99]
*** Cast iron ***
Main article: Cast_iron
Cast_iron was first produced in China during 5th century BC,[100] but was
hardly in Europe until the medieval period.[101][102] The earliest cast iron
artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern Luhe_County,
Jiangsu in China. Cast iron was used in ancient_China for warfare, agriculture,
and architecture.[103] During the medieval period, means were found in Europe
of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig_iron)
using finery_forges. For all these processes, charcoal was required as fuel.
[104]
Coalbrookdale_by_Night, 1801. Blast furnaces light the iron making town of
Coalbrookdale.
Medieval blast_furnaces were about 10 feet (3.0 m) tall and made of fireproof
brick; forced air was usually provided by hand-operated bellows.[102] Modern
blast furnaces have grown much bigger, with hearths fourteen meters in diameter
that allow them to produce thousands of tons of iron each day, but essentially
operate in much the same way as they did during medieval times.[104]
In 1709, Abraham_Darby_I established a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast
iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The
ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the
Industrial_Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to
replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon
content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in
properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.[84]
Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major
structural material following the building of the innovative first_iron_bridge
in 1778. This bridge still stands today as a monument to the role iron played
in the Industrial Revolution. Following this, iron was used in rails, boats,
ships, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as in iron cylinders in steam_engines.
[104] Railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of
progress[105] and various languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Italian and German)
refer to railways as iron road.
*** Steel ***
Main article: Steel
See also: Steelmaking
Steel (with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron)
was first produced in antiquity by using a bloomery. Blacksmiths in Luristan in
western Persia were making good steel by 1000 BC.[84] Then improved versions,
Wootz_steel by India and Damascus_steel were developed around 300 BC and AD 500
respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a
major commodity until the 1850s.[106]
New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation
process were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial_Revolution, new
methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were
later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry_Bessemer invented a
new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to
produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to
wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.[107]
**** Foundations of modern chemistry ****
In 1774, Antoine_Lavoisier used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron
inside an incandescent iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments leading
to the demonstration of the conservation_of_mass, which was instrumental in
changing chemistry from a qualitative science to a quantitative one.[108]
***** Symbolic role *****
"Gold gab ich fÃ¼r Eisen" â "I gave gold for iron". German-American brooch
from WWI.
Iron plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as_a
metaphor and in folklore. The Greek poet Hesiod's Works_and_Days (lines
109â201) lists different ages_of_man named after metals like gold, silver,
bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity.[109] The Iron Age
was closely related with Rome, and in Ovid's Metamorphoses
     The Virtues, in despair, quit the earth; and the depravity of man
     becomes universal and complete. Hard steel succeeded then.
     â Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book I, Iron age, line 160 ff
An example of the importance of iron's symbolic role may be found in the German
Campaign_of_1813. Frederick_William_III commissioned then the first Iron_Cross
as military decoration. Berlin_iron_jewellery reached its peak production
between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian royal_family urged citizens to donate
gold and silver jewellery for military funding. The inscription Gold gab ich
fÃ¼r Eisen (I gave gold for iron) was used as well in later war efforts.[110]
***** Production of metallic iron *****
Iron_powder
**** Laboratory routes ****
For a few limited purposes when it is needed, pure iron is produced in the
laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with
hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250 Â°C so that it
decomposes to form pure iron powder.[37] Another method is electrolysis of
ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.[111]

Nowadays, the industrial production of iron or steel consists of two main
stages. In the first stage, iron ore is reduced with coke in a blast_furnace,
and the molten metal is separated from gross impurities such as silicate
minerals. This stage yields an alloy -- pig_ironâthat contains relatively
large amounts of carbon. In the second stage, the amount of carbon in the pig
iron is lowered by oxidation to yield wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.[113]
Other metals can be added at this stage to form alloy_steels.

How iron was extracted in the 19th century
*** Blast furnace processing ***
Main article: Blast_furnace
The blast furnace is loaded with iron ores, usually hematite Fe
2O
3 or magnetite Fe
3O
4, together with coke (coal that has been separately baked to remove volatile
components). Air pre-heated to 900 Â°C is blown through the mixture, in
sufficient amount to turn the carbon into carbon_monoxide:[113]
      2 C + O2 â 2 CO
This reaction raises the temperature to about 2000 Â°C The carbon monoxide
reduces the iron ore to metallic iron[113]
      Fe2O3 + 3 CO â 2 Fe + 3 CO2
Some iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly
with the coke:[113]
      2 Fe2O3 + 3 C â 4 Fe + 3 CO2
A flux such as limestone (calcium_carbonate) or dolomite (calcium-magnesium
carbonate) is also added to the furnace's load. Its purpose is to remove
silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the furnace. The
heat of the furnace decomposes the carbonates to calcium_oxide, which reacts
with any excess silica to form a slag composed of calcium_silicate CaSiO
3 or other products. At the furnace's temperature, the metal and the slag are
both molten. They collect at the bottom as two immiscible liquid layers (with
the slag on top), that are then easily separated.[113] The slag can be used as
a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for
agriculture.[102]
This heap of iron ore pellets will be used in steel production.
*** Steelmaking ***
Main articles: Steelmaking and Ironworks
A pot of molten iron being used to make steel
In general, the pig iron produced by the blast furnace process contains up to
4â5% carbon, with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium,
phosphorus, and manganese. The high level of carbon makes it relatively weak
and brittle. Reducing the amount of carbon to 0.002â2.1% by mass-produces
steel, which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron. A great variet of
steel articles can then be made by cold_working, hot_rolling, forging,
machining, etc. Removing the other impurities, instead, results in cast iron,
which is used to cast articles in foundries; for example stoves, pipes,
radiators, lamp-posts, and rails.[113]
Steel products often undergo various heat_treatments after they are forged to
shape. Annealing consists of heating them to 700â800 Â°C for several hours
and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.[115]
**** Direct iron reduction ****
Owing to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have
been developed. "Direct_iron_reduction" reduces_iron_ore to a ferrous lump
called "sponge"_iron or "direct" iron that is suitable for steelmaking.[102]
Two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process:
Natural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):[102]
      2 CH4 + O2 â 2 CO + 4 H2
Iron ore is then treated with these gases in a furnace, producing solid sponge
iron:[102]
      Fe2O3 + CO + 2 H2 â 2 Fe + CO2 + 2 H2O
Silica is removed by adding a limestone flux as described above.[102]
**** Thermite process ****
Main article: Thermite
Ignition of a mixture of aluminium powder and iron oxide yields metallic iron
via the thermite_reaction:
      Fe2O3 + 2 Al â 2 Fe + Al2O3
Alternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or
wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for
this, including finery_forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer_converters, open
hearth_furnaces, basic_oxygen_furnaces, and electric_arc_furnaces. In all
cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with
other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy
steels.[104]
***** Applications *****
**** As structural material ****
Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for over 90% of
worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength often make it the
material of choice material to withstand stress or transmit forces, such as the
construction of machinery and machine_tools, rails, automobiles, ship_hulls,
concrete_reinforcing_bars, and the load-carrying framework of buildings. Since
pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to
make steel.[116]

The mechanical properties of iron and its alloys are extremely relevant to
their structural applications. Those propertirs can be evaluated in various
ways, including the Brinell_test, the Rockwell_test and the Vickers_hardness
test.
The properties of pure iron are often used to calibrate measurements or to
compare tests.[118][119] However, the mechanical properties of iron are
significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron
are actually softer than aluminium,[117] and the purest industrially produced
iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20â30 Brinell.[120]
An increase in the carbon content will cause a significant increase in the
hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65_Rc is achieved
with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength.[121]
Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its
heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.[13]
Iron-carbon phase diagram
*** Types of steels and alloys ***
See also: Steel
Î±-Iron is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of
carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 Â°C).[122] Austenite (Î³-iron) is
similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much
as 2.04% by mass at 1146 Â°C). This form of iron is used in the type of
stainless_steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service
equipment.[17]
Commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance of
additives. Pig_iron has 3.5â4.5% carbon[123] and contains varying amounts of
contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable
product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and
steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect
material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing
2â4% carbon, 1â6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese.[113] Pig iron
has a melting_point in the range of 1420â1470 K, which is lower than either
of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when
carbon and iron are heated together.[9] Its mechanical properties vary greatly
and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.[13]
"White" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of cementite, or iron
carbide (Fe3C).[13] This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical
properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock.
The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken
iron carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation.
Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723 Â°C to room
temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and Î±-iron,
which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance. Rapid
cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates
hard and brittle martensite. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a
temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite.
The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-Î±Fe mixture, and that
above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.[13]
In gray_iron the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite, and also
renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that
produce stress_concentration sites within the material.[124] A newer variant of
gray iron, referred to as ductile_iron, is specially treated with trace amounts
of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing
the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of
the material.[124]
Wrought_iron contains less than 0.25% carbon but large amounts of slag that
give it a fibrous characteristic.[123] It is a tough, malleable product, but
not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought
iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of slag entrapped within
the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been
almost completely replaced by mild_steel for traditional "wrought iron"
products and blacksmithing.
Mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more
widely available. Carbon_steel contains 2.0% carbon or less,[125] with small
amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy_steels contain
varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as chromium, vanadium,
molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and
so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel,
though, is stainless_steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have
produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-
strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths
and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.[125][126][127]
[A_graph_of_attenuation_coefficient_vs._energy_between_1 meV_and_100 keV_for
several_photon_scattering_mechanisms.]
Photon mass_attenuation_coefficient for iron.
Apart from traditional applications, iron is also used for protection from
ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection
material, lead, it is much stronger mechanically. The attenuation of radiation
as a function of energy is shown in the graph.[128]
The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its
alloys, suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way, a cost amounting
to over 1% of the world's economy.[129] Painting, galvanization, passivation,
plastic coating and bluing are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding
water and oxygen or by cathodic_protection. The mechanism of the rusting of
iron is as follows:[129]
      Cathode: 3 O2 + 6 H2O + 12 eâ â 12 OHâ
      Anode: 4 Fe â 4 Fe2+ + 8 eâ; 4 Fe2+ â 4 Fe3+ + 4 eâ
      Overall: 4 Fe + 3 O2 + 6 H2O â 4 Fe3+ + 12 OHâ â 4 Fe(OH)3 or 4 FeO
      (OH) + 4 H2O
The electrolyte is usually iron(II)_sulfate in urban areas (formed when
atmospheric sulfur_dioxide attacks iron), and salt particles in the atmosphere
in seaside areas.[129]
**** Iron compounds ****
Although the dominant use of iron is in metallurgy, iron compounds are also
pervasive in industry. Iron catalysts are traditionally used in the Haber-Bosch
process for the production of ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch_process for
conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants.[130]
Powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the Bechamp_reduction the
reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline.[131]
Iron(III)_oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite
reaction, used in welding large iron parts (like rails) and purifying ores.
Iron(III) oxide and oxyhidroxide are used as reddish and ocher pigments.
Iron(III)_chloride finds use in water purification and sewage_treatment, in the
dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in animal feed,
and as an etchant for copper in the manufacture of printed_circuit_boards.[132]
It can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron, which is used as
a medicine to stop bleeding in canaries.[133]
Iron(II)_sulfate is used as a precursor to other iron compounds. It is also
used to reduce chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat iron
deficiency_anemia. Iron(III)_sulfate is used in settling minute sewage
particles in tank water. Iron(II)_chloride is used as a reducing flocculating
agent, in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides, and as a
reducing agent in organic synthesis.[132]
***** Biological and pathological role *****
Main article: Human_iron_metabolism
Iron is required for life.[8][134][135] The ironâsulfur_clusters are
pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological
nitrogen_fixation. Iron-containing proteins participate in transport, storage
and used of oxygen.[8] Iron proteins are involved in electron_transfer.[136]
Structure of Heme_b; in the protein additional ligand(s) would be attached to
Fe.
Examples of iron-containing proteins in higher organisms include hemoglobin,
cytochrome (see high-valent_iron), and catalase.[8][137] The average adult
human contains about 0.005% body weight of iron, or about four grams, of which
three quarters is in hemoglobin â a level that remains constant despite only
about one milligram of iron being absorbed each day,[136] because the human
body recycles its hemoglobin for the iron content.[138]
**** Biochemistry ****
Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is
poorly soluble near neutral pH. Thus, these organisms have developed means to
absorb iron as complexes, sometimes taking up ferrous iron before oxidising it
back to ferric iron.[8] In particular, bacteria have evolved very high-affinity
sequestering agents called siderophores.[139][140][141]
After uptake in human cells, iron storage is precisely regulated.[8][142] A
major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin, which binds iron
ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells.[8][143]
Transferrin contains Fe3+ in the middle of a distorted octahedron, bonded to
one nitrogen, three oxygens and a chelating carbonate anion that traps the Fe3+
ion: it has such a high stability_constant that it is very effective at taking
up Fe3+ ions even from the most stable complexes. At the bone marrow,
transferrin is reduced from Fe3+ and Fe2+ and stored as ferritin to be
incorporated into hemoglobin.[136]
The most commonly known and studied bioinorganic iron compounds (biological
iron molecules) are the heme_proteins: examples are hemoglobin, myoglobin, and
cytochrome_P450.[8] These compounds participate in transporting gases, building
enzymes, and transferring electrons.[136] Metalloproteins are a group of
proteins with metal ion cofactors. Some examples of iron metalloproteins are
ferritin and rubredoxin.[136] Many enzymes vital to life contain iron, such as
catalase,[144] lipoxygenases,[145] and IRE-BP.[146]
Hemoglobin is an oxygen carrier that occurs in red_blood_cells and contributes
their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles
where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for
the metabolic oxidation of glucose, generating energy.[8] Here the hemoglobin
binds to carbon_dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is
transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate
anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled.[136] In hemoglobin, the iron is
in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are
occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole
nitrogen in a histidine residue of one of the protein chains attached to the
heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly
bind to.[136] When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called
deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion at the center of the heme group (in the
hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too
large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with
the Fe2+ ion about 55 picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth
coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine
residue.[136]
When deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves
away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a hydrogen_bond
with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration,
resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the
porphyrin ring, which becomes planar.[136] (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding
results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a FeâOâO bond
angle of around 120Â° that avoids the formation of FeâOâFe or FeâO2âFe
bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+,
and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the
protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to
a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen,
its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa.[136] Myoglobin, on the
other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect
cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the
high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is
much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial
pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue.[136] As described by the Bohr
effect (named after Christian_Bohr, the father of Niels_Bohr), the oxygen
affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide.[136]
A heme unit of human carboxyhemoglobin, showing the carbonyl_ligand at the
apical position, trans to the histidine residue.[147]
Carbon_monoxide and phosphorus_trifluoride are poisonous to humans because they
bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen, but with much more strength, so that
oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body. Hemoglobin bound to
carbon monoxide is known as carboxyhemoglobin. This effect also plays a minor
role in the toxicity of cyanide, but there the major effect is by far its
interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein
cytochrome a.[136] The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are
involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth
coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a
methionine sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen â with
the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very
easily poisoned by cyanide.[136] Here, the electron transfer takes place as the
iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states.
Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the
previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in
adenosine_triphosphate. Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the
mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as
well as electrons, as follows:[136]
      4 Cytc2+ + O2 + 8H+
      inside â 4 Cytc3+ + 2 H2O + 4H+
      outside
Although the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing
proteins, the iron-sulfur_proteins are also very important, being involved in
electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the
+2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that
are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because
of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest
of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to
four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains.
Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have
multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.
[136]
The ability of sea mussels to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is
facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-
rich cuticles. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these
structures increased elastic_modulus 770 times, tensile_strength 58 times, and
toughness 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them
increased 76 times.[148]
**** Health and diet ****
Iron is pervasive, but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include red
meat, oysters, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf_vegetables, watercress,
tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed_peas, and blackstrap_molasses.[8] Bread and
breakfast_cereals are sometimes specifically fortified with iron.[8][149]
Iron provided by dietary_supplements is often found as iron(II)_fumarate,
although iron(II)_sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well.[132]
Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to
two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate),[150] is often added to
foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available
to the body when chelated to amino acids[151] and is also available for use as
a common iron_supplement. Glycine, the least expensive amino acid, is most
often used to produce iron glycinate supplements.[152]
**** Dietary recommendations ****
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements
(EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for iron in 2001.[8] The
current EAR for iron for women ages 14â18 is 7.9 mg/day, 8.1 for ages 19â50
and 5.0 thereafter (post menopause). For men the EAR is 6.0 mg/day for ages 19
and up. The RDA is 15.0 mg/day for women ages 15â18, 18.0 for 19â50 and 8.0
thereafter. For men, 8.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. RDAs are higher than EARs
so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average
requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 27 mg/day and, for lactation, 9 mg/day.[8]
For children ages 1â3 years 7 mg/day, 10 for ages 4â8 and 8 for ages
9â13. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable_upper_intake_levels (ULs)
for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of iron the
UL is set at 45 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as
Dietary_Reference_Intakes.[153]
The European_Food_Safety_Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of
information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI)
instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the
same as in United States. For women the PRI is 13 mg/day ages 15â17 years,
16 mg/day for women ages 18 and up who are premenopausal and 11 mg/day
postmenopausal. For pregnancy and lactation, 16 mg/day. For men the PRI is
11 mg/day ages 15 and older. For children ages 1 to 14 the PRI increases from 7
to 11 mg/day. The PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs, with the exception of
pregnancy.[154] The EFSA reviewed the same safety question did not establish a
UL.[155]
Infants may require iron supplements if they are bottle-fed cow's milk.[156]
Frequent blood_donors are at risk of low iron levels and are often advised to
supplement their iron intake.[157]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving
is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For iron labeling purposes 100%
of the Daily Value was 18 mg, and as of May 27, 2016[update] remained unchanged
at 18 mg.[158] A table of all of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided
at Reference_Daily_Intake. The original deadline to be in compliance was July
28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the U.S. Food_and_Drug_Administration
released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for
large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.[159]
**** Deficiency ****
Main article: Iron_deficiency
Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional_deficiency in the world.[8][160]
[161][162] When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary
iron intake, a state of latent_iron_deficiency occurs, which over time leads to
iron-deficiency_anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an
insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of
hemoglobin.[163] Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age),
and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of
iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like
fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth
in infants and children.[164]
**** Excess ****
Main article: Iron_overload
Iron_uptake is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated
physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost
daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron
levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake.[165] Regulation of iron
uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic_defect that maps to
the HLA-H gene region on chromosome_6 and leads to abnormally low levels of
hepcidin, a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in
mammals.[166] In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron
overload_disorders, known medically as hemochromatosis.[8] Many people have an
undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload, and are not aware of a
family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take iron
supplements unless they suffer from iron_deficiency and have consulted a
doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8% of all
metabolic diseases of Caucasians.[167]
Overdoses of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of free iron in the
blood. High blood levels of free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce
highly reactive free_radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other
cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron,
which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin
to bind the iron. Damage to the cells of the gastrointestinal_tract can also
prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in
blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere,
causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic_acidosis, shock, liver
failure, coagulopathy, adult_respiratory_distress_syndrome, long-term organ
damage, and even death.[168] Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron
exceeds 20 milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60 milligrams per
kilogram is considered a lethal_dose.[169] Overconsumption of iron, often the
result of children eating large quantities of ferrous_sulfate tablets intended
for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death
in children under six.[169] The Dietary_Reference_Intake (DRI) sets the
Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45 mg/day. For children under
fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.[170]
The medical management of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include use of
a specific chelating agent called deferoxamine to bind and expel excess iron
from the body.[168][171][172]
**** Cancer ****
The role of iron in cancer defense can be described as a "double-edged sword"
because of its pervasive presence in non-pathological processes.[173] People
having chemotherapy may develop iron deficiency and anemia, for which
intravenous iron therapy is used to restore iron levels.[174] Iron overload,
which may occur from high consumption of red meat,[8] may initiate tumor growth
and increase susceptibility to cancer onset,[174] particularly for colorectal
cancer.[8]
