Transport or transportation is the movement of humans, animals and goods from
one location to another. In other words, the action of transport is defined as
a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to a Point B.
Modes_of_transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable, pipeline
and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and
operations. Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the
development of civilizations.
Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads,
railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as
airports, railway_stations, bus_stations, warehouses, trucking terminals,
refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel_stations) and seaports.
Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for
maintenance.
Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses,
trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft and aircraft.
Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set
for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the
transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either
public or private, depending on the country and mode.
Passenger transport may be public, where operators provide scheduled services,
or private. Freight transport has become focused on containerization, although
bulk_transport is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an
important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air
pollution and use_large_amounts_of_land. While it is heavily subsidized by
governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic_flow and
restrain urban_sprawl.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_transport

Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The
domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on
more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans
riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and
the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction
of vehicles. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to
time_immemorial, and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities
or over large distances prior to the Industrial_Revolution.
The first forms of road_transport involved animals, such as horses
(domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE)
[1] or humans carrying goods over dirt tracks that often followed game trails.
Many early civilizations, including those in Mesopotamia and the Indus_Valley,
constructed paved roads. In classical_antiquity, the Persian and Roman empires
built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of
crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval Caliphate later
built tar-paved roads. The first watercraft were canoes cut out from tree
trunks. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either
rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The
importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading
being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two
bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and
costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as
feasible.
The Wright_brothers' first flight in 1903
The Industrial_Revolution in the 19th century saw a number of inventions
fundamentally change transport. With telegraphy, communication became instant
and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the
steam_engine, closely followed by its application in rail_transport, made land
transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity
increased rapidly, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located
independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development
of the steam_ship, which sped up global transport.
With the development of the combustion_engine and the automobile around 1900,
road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport
originated. The first "modern" highways were constructed during the 19th
century[citation_needed] with macadam. Later, tarmac and concrete became the
dominant paving materials. In 1903 the Wright_brothers demonstrated the first
successful controllable airplane, and after World War I (1914â1918) aircraft
became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.[2]
After World War II (1939â1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares
of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger
services.[3] Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until
the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s the introduction of
containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering
globalization.[4] International air travel became much more accessible in the
1960s with the commercialization of the jet_engine. Along with the growth in
automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative
importance. After the introduction of the Shinkansen in Japan in 1964, high-
speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes
away from the airlines.[3]
Early in U.S._history,[when?] private joint-stock corporations owned most
aqueducts, bridges, canals, railroads, roads, and tunnels. Most such transport
infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail-
service with the establishment of Amtrak. Recently,[when?] however, a movement
to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some[quantify] ground
and adherents.[5]

***** Mode[edit] *****
Main article: Mode_of_transport
A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of
vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo
may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called
intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and
disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability,
and route.
**** Human-powered[edit] ****
Main article: Human-powered_transport
Human-powered_transport remains common in developing countries.
Human-powered transport, a form of sustainable_transport, is the transport of
people and/or goods using human muscle-power, in the form of walking, running
and swimming. Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power.
Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure,
physical_exercise, and environmentalism; it is sometimes the only type
available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.
Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be
enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with
vehicles, such as bicycles and inline_skates. Human-powered vehicles have also
been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by
watercraft_rowing and skiing; even the air can be entered with human-powered
aircraft.
**** Animal-powered[edit] ****
Main article: Animal-powered_transport
Animal-powered transport is the use of working_animals for the movement of
people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them
as pack_animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams, to pull
sleds or wheeled vehicles.
**** Air[edit] ****
Main article: Aviation
[White_jet_aircraft_coming_into_land,_undercarriage_fully_extended._Under_each
wing_is_a_turbofan_engine]
An Air_France Airbus A318 lands at London_Heathrow_Airport.
A fixed-wing_aircraft, commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft
where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift.
The term is used to distinguish this from rotary-wing_aircraft, where the
movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A gyroplane
is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small
trainers and recreational aircraft to large airliners and military cargo
aircraft.
Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an
area for landing. The majority of aircraft also need an airport with the
infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the
loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. While the vast majority
of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing
on ice, snow, and calm water.
The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket.
Commercial jets can reach up to 955 kilometres per hour (593 mph), single-
engine aircraft 555 kilometres per hour (345 mph). Aviation is able to quickly
transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs
high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places,
helicopters can be used.[6] As of April 28, 2009, The Guardian article notes
that "the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time."
[7]
**** Land[edit] ****
Main article: Land_transport
Land transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the
movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in
linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in urban
planning. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.
*** Rail[edit] ***
Main article: Rail_transport
[White_electric_train_with_red_cheatline_emerging_from_tunnel_in_the
countryside]
InterCityExpress, a German high-speed passenger train
The New_York_City_Subway is the world's largest rapid_transit system by length
of routes and by number of stations.
Rail transport is where a train runs along a set of two parallel steel rails,
known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties
(or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance
apart, or gauge. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation
made of concrete or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast.
Alternative methods include monorail and maglev.
A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails.
Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive, that hauls a series of
unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be
powered by steam, diesel or by electricity supplied by trackside_systems.
Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a multiple_unit.
Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas
turbines. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on
paved roads, making trains more energy_efficient, though not as efficient as
ships.
Intercity trains are long-haul services connecting cities;[8] modern high-speed
rail is capable of speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph), but this requires specially
built track. Regional and commuter trains feed cities from suburbs and
surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity
tramways and rapid_transits, often making up the backbone of a city's public
transport. Freight_trains traditionally used box_cars, requiring manual loading
and unloading of the cargo. Since the 1960s, container_trains have become the
dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are
transported by dedicated trains.
*** Road[edit] ***
Main article: Road_transport
The Harbor_Freeway is often heavily congested at rush hour in Downtown_Los
Angeles.
A road is an identifiable route, way or path between two or more places.[9]
Roads are typically smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy
travel;[10] though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply
recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance.[11] In
urban_areas, roads may pass through a city or village and be named as streets,
serving a dual function as urban space easement and route.[12]
The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a wheeled passenger vehicle
that carries its own motor. Other users of roads include buses, trucks,
motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion
automobiles worldwide. Road transport offers a complete freedom to road users
to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another
according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location,
direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of
transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road
transport.
Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy
and area use, and are the main source of noise and air_pollution in cities;
buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.[13]
Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight
transport.
**** Water[edit] ****
Main article: Ship_transport

Water transport is movement by means of a watercraftâsuch as a barge, boat,
ship or sailboatâover a body of water, such as a sea, ocean, lake, canal or
river. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the hull a
dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.
In the 19th century, the first steam_ships were developed, using a steam_engine
to drive a paddle_wheel or propeller to move the ship. The steam was produced
in a boiler using wood or coal and fed through a steam external_combustion
engine. Now most ships have an internal_combustion_engine using a slightly
refined type of petroleum called bunker_fuel. Some ships, such as submarines,
use nuclear_power to produce the steam. Recreational or educational craft still
use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal_combustion_engines to
drive one or more propellers, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water
jet. In shallow draft areas, hovercraft are propelled by large pusher-prop
fans. (See Marine_propulsion.)
Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea_transport is a
highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. Commercial
vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4 billion tons of cargo in 2007.
[14] Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for
transcontinental shipping;[15] short_sea_shipping and ferries remain viable in
coastal areas.[16][17]
**** Other modes[edit] ****
[Oil_pipeline_winding_through_cold_Alaskan_country-side._In_the_background_are
mountains,_partly_snow-capped]
Trans-Alaska_Pipeline for crude_oil
Pipeline_transport sends goods through a pipe; most commonly liquid and gases
are sent, but pneumatic_tubes can also send solid capsules using compressed
air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through
a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for sewage, slurry, water and beer,
while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural_gas.
Cable_transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of
an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep gradient. Typical
solutions include aerial_tramway, elevators, escalator and ski_lifts; some of
these are also categorized as conveyor transport.
Spaceflight is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into outer_space by means of
a spacecraft. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is
rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific
experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to
all the planets of the Solar System.
Suborbital_spaceflight is the fastest of the existing and planned transport
systems from a place on Earth to a distant "other place" on Earth. Faster
transport could be achieved through part of a low_Earth_orbit, or following
that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.
***** Elements[edit] *****
**** Infrastructure[edit] ****
Main article: Infrastructure
Bridges, such as Golden_Gate_Bridge, allow roads and railways to cross bodies
of water.
Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It
consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance.
For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle
travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since
the airway and seaway do not need to be constructed. However, they require
fixed infrastructure at terminals.
Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers
and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For
passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders,
who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits.
For instance, airport_rail_links connect airports to the city centers and
suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are parking_lots, while buses and
coaches can operate from simple stops.[18] For freight, terminals act as
transshipment points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point
of production to the point of use.
The financing of infrastructure can either be public or private. Transport is
often a natural_monopoly and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some
countries railways and airports are funded through taxation. New infrastructure
projects can have high costs and are often financed through debt. Many
infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as landing_fees at
airports, or toll_plazas on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose
taxes on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and
overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits
shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.[19]
**** Vehicles[edit] ****
Main article: Vehicle
A Fiat_Uno in 2018
A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike
the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless
being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its
own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a steam_engine, combustion
engine, electric_motor, a jet_engine or a rocket, though other means of
propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy
into movement; this is most commonly done through wheels, propellers and
pressure.
Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a driver. However, some systems, such as
people_movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated. For passenger
transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the
passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft,
may have one of the passengers as a driver.
**** Operation[edit] ****
[Tilted_aerial_view_of_modern_airport._Aircraft_are_parked_next_to_"arms"_that
extend_from_the_central_building]
Incheon_International_Airport, South Korea
Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the
vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are
done through private_enterprise or by governments. The infrastructure and
vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated
by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a national
airline and national_railway. Since the 1980s, many of these have been
privatized. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with
little regulation,[20] but ports can be public-owned.[21]
**** Policy[edit] ****
As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and
populationâaccording to the United Nations, 55% of the worldâs population
live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%.[22] Public
transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban
world.[23] The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by
nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as
possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.
***** Functions[edit] *****
Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport.
However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of
armed_forces during warfare, or the civilian mobility construction or emergency
equipment.
**** Passenger[edit] ****
Main articles: Travel and Public_transit
[Light_green,_orange_and_white_bus_stopping_in_front_of_multi-story_building.]
A local transit bus operated by ACTION in Canberra, Australia
Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into public and private_transport.
Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is
vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers
better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact.
Travel may be as part of daily commuting, for business, leisure or migration.
Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The
latter consists of buses in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter
rail, trams and rapid_transit in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves
the use of the automobile, trains, coaches and aircraft, the last of which have
become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel.
Intermodal_passenger_transport is where a journey is performed through the use
of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and
ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public
transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across
modes, at a transport_hub, such as a bus or railway_station.
Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum.
Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and
taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is demand-responsive
transport, offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.
International_travel may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation
and visa requirements.
**** Medical transport[edit] ****
An ambulance from World War I
An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of
treatment,[24] and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical
care to the patient. The word is often associated with road-going "emergency
ambulances", which form part of emergency_medical_services, administering
emergency_care to those with acute medical problems.
Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport
to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes.
Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to
all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations,
aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft.[25][26]
**** Freight[edit] ****
Main article: Shipping
Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the value_chain in manufacturing.
[27] With increased specialization and globalization, production is being
located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for
transport.[28] Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the
place of production to the place of consumption. While all modes of transport
are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature
of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.[29] Logistics refers to the
entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including
storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and
packaging, with associated exchange of information.[30] Incoterm deals with the
handling of payment and responsibility of risk during transport.[31]
Freight_train with shipping_containers in the United_Kingdom
Containerization, with the standardization of ISO_containers on all vehicles
and at all ports, has revolutionized international and domestic_trade, offering
a huge reduction in transshipment costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be
manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization
allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized
sizes allow for gains in economy_of_scale in vehicle operation. This has been
one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since
the 1950s.[4]
Bulk_transport is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without
deterioration; typical examples are ore, coal, cereals and petroleum. Because
of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous
quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo
combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential
in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to
transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported
by pipeline.
Air_freight has become more common for products of high value; while less than
one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty
percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to
principles such as postponement and just-in-time within the value chain,
resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or
items of high value-to-weight ratio.[32] In addition to mail, common items sent
by air include electronics and fashion clothing.
***** Impact[edit] *****
Main article: Sustainable_transport
**** Economic[edit] ****
Main article: Transport_economics
[Skyline_of_city_at_dawn._A_major_highway_winds_itself_into_the_downtown_area.]
Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in Seattle,
Washington, United States.
Transport is a key necessity for specializationâallowing production and
consumption of products to occur at different locations. Throughout history,
transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more trade and
a greater spread of people. Economic_growth has always been dependent on
increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.[33] But the
infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and
transport is the largest drainer of energy, making transport_sustainability a
major issue.
Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a
physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people
to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to
temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also
the essence of tourism, a major part of recreational transport. Commerce
requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-
face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their
regular place of work to sites where they are needed.
**** Planning[edit] ****
Main article: Transport_planning
Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new
infrastructure. Using models of transport_forecasting, planners are able to
predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows
owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply_chain. Transport as a
field is also studied through transport_economics, a component for the creation
of regulation policy by authorities. Transport_engineering, a sub-discipline of
civil_engineering, must take into account trip_generation, trip_distribution,
mode_choice and route_assignment, while the operative level is handled through
traffic_engineering.
[Aerial_view_of_roundabout,_a_junction_of_several_streets._Vehicles_traverse
around_the_roundabout,_which_is_surrounded_by_buildings,_mostly_multi-storey]
The engineering of this roundabout in Bristol, United Kingdom, attempts to make
traffic flow free-moving.
Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject
of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity.
Automotive transport can be seen as a tragedy_of_the_commons, where the
flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban
environment for all. Density_of_development depends on mode of transport, with
public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps
common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development
closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There
are economies_of_agglomeration. Beyond transport, some land uses are more
efficient when clustered. Transport facilities consume land, and in cities
pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the
total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.
Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput
mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and manyâif not allâof
the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that
traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result
of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than
those traditionally relied onâspanning such areas as environmental impact
analysis, public health, sociology and economicsâthe viability of the old
mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned.
**** Environment[edit] ****

some_of_which_are_covered_in_advertisement_billboards]
Traffic_congestion persists in SÃ£o_Paulo, Brazil, despite the no-drive days
based on license numbers.
Main article: Environmental_impact_of_transport
Transport is a major use of energy and burns most of the world's petroleum.
This creates air pollution, including nitrous_oxides and particulates, and is a
significant contributor to global_warming through emission of carbon_dioxide,
[34] for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.[35] By
subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.
[36]Environmental_regulations in developed countries have reduced individual
vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers
of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle.[34] Some pathways to reduce the
carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.[37][38]
Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists
to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport,
as well as increased transport_electrification and energy_efficiency.
Other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic_congestion and
automobile-oriented urban_sprawl, which can consume natural habitat and
