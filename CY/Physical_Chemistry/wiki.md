Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and
particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles,
practices, and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time,
thermodynamics, quantum_chemistry, statistical_mechanics, analytical_dynamics
and chemical_equilibrium.
Physical chemistry, in contrast to chemical_physics, is predominantly (but not
always) a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the
principles on which it was founded relate to the bulk rather than the
molecular/atomic structure alone (for example, chemical equilibrium and
colloids).
Some of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include
the effects of:
   1. Intermolecular_forces that act upon the physical properties of materials
      (plasticity, tensile_strength, surface_tension in liquids).
   2. Reaction_kinetics on the rate_of_a_reaction.
   3. The identity of ions and the electrical conductivity of materials.
   4. Surface_science and electrochemistry of cell_membranes.[1]
   5. Interaction of one body with another in terms of quantities of heat and
      work called thermodynamics.
   6. Transfer of heat between a chemical system and its surroundings during
      change of phase or chemical_reaction taking place called thermochemistry
   7. Study of colligative_properties of number of species present in solution.
   8. Number of phases, number of components and degree of freedom (or
      variance) can be correlated with one another with help of phase_rule.
   9. Reactions of electrochemical_cells.

***** Key concepts[edit] *****
The key concepts of physical chemistry are the ways in which pure physics is
applied to chemical problems.
One of the key concepts in classical chemistry is that all chemical_compounds
can be described as groups of atoms bonded together and chemical_reactions can
be described as the making and breaking of those bonds. Predicting the
properties of chemical compounds from a description of atoms and how they bond
is one of the major goals of physical chemistry. To describe the atoms and
bonds precisely, it is necessary to know both where the nuclei of the atoms
are, and how electrons are distributed around them.[2]
Quantum_chemistry, a subfield of physical chemistry especially concerned with
the application of quantum_mechanics to chemical problems, provides tools to
determine how strong and what shape bonds are,[2] how nuclei move, and how
light can be absorbed or emitted by a chemical compound.[3] Spectroscopy is the
related sub-discipline of physical chemistry which is specifically concerned
with the interaction of electromagnetic_radiation with matter.
Another set of important questions in chemistry concerns what kind of reactions
can happen spontaneously and which properties are possible for a given chemical
mixture. This is studied in chemical_thermodynamics, which sets limits on
quantities like how far a reaction can proceed, or how much energy can be
converted into work in an internal_combustion_engine, and which provides links
between properties like the thermal_expansion_coefficient and rate of change of
entropy with pressure for a gas or a liquid.[4] It can frequently be used to
assess whether a reactor or engine design is feasible, or to check the validity
of experimental data. To a limited extent, quasi-equilibrium and non-
equilibrium_thermodynamics can describe irreversible changes.[5] However,
classical thermodynamics is mostly concerned with systems in equilibrium and
reversible_changes and not what actually does happen, or how fast, away from
equilibrium.
Which reactions do occur and how fast is the subject of chemical_kinetics,
another branch of physical chemistry. A key idea in chemical kinetics is that
for reactants to react and form products, most chemical species must go through
transition_states which are higher in energy than either the reactants or the
products and serve as a barrier to reaction.[6] In general, the higher the
barrier, the slower the reaction. A second is that most chemical reactions
occur as a sequence of elementary_reactions,[7] each with its own transition
state. Key questions in kinetics include how the rate of reaction depends on
temperature and on the concentrations of reactants and catalysts in the
reaction mixture, as well as how catalysts and reaction conditions can be
engineered to optimize the reaction rate.
The fact that how fast reactions occur can often be specified with just a few
concentrations and a temperature, instead of needing to know all the positions
and speeds of every molecule in a mixture, is a special case of another key
concept in physical chemistry, which is that to the extent an engineer needs to
know, everything going on in a mixture of very large numbers (perhaps of the
order of the Avogadro_constant, 6 x 1023) of particles can often be described
by just a few variables like pressure, temperature, and concentration. The
precise reasons for this are described in statistical_mechanics,[8] a specialty
within physical chemistry which is also shared with physics. Statistical
mechanics also provides ways to predict the properties we see in everyday life
from molecular properties without relying on empirical correlations based on
chemical similarities.[5]
***** History[edit] *****

Fragment of M. Lomonosov's manuscript 'Physical Chemistry' (1752)
The term "physical chemistry" was coined by Mikhail_Lomonosov in 1752, when he
presented a lecture course entitled "A Course in True Physical Chemistry"
(Russian: Â«ÐÑÑÑ Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ ÑÐ¸Ð·Ð¸ÑÐµÑÐºÐ¾Ð¹ ÑÐ¸Ð¼Ð¸Ð¸Â») before
the students of Petersburg_University.[9] In the preamble to these lectures he
gives the definition: "Physical chemistry is the science that must explain
under provisions of physical experiments the reason for what is happening in
complex bodies through chemical operations".
Modern physical chemistry originated in the 1860s to 1880s with work on
chemical_thermodynamics, electrolytes in solutions, chemical_kinetics and other
subjects. One milestone was the publication in 1876 by Josiah_Willard_Gibbs of
his paper, On_the_Equilibrium_of_Heterogeneous_Substances. This paper
introduced several of the cornerstones of physical chemistry, such as Gibbs
energy, chemical_potentials, and Gibbs'_phase_rule.[10]
The first scientific_journal specifically in the field of physical chemistry
was the German journal, Zeitschrift_fÃ¼r_Physikalische_Chemie, founded in 1887
by Wilhelm_Ostwald and Jacobus_Henricus_van_'t_Hoff. Together with Svante
August_Arrhenius,[11] these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in
the late 19th century and early 20th century. All three were awarded the Nobel
Prize_in_Chemistry between 1901â1909.
Developments in the following decades include the application of statistical
mechanics to chemical systems and work on colloids and surface_chemistry, where
Irving_Langmuir made many contributions. Another important step was the
development of quantum_mechanics into quantum_chemistry from the 1930s, where
Linus_Pauling was one of the leading names. Theoretical developments have gone
hand in hand with developments in experimental methods, where the use of
different forms of spectroscopy, such as infrared_spectroscopy, microwave
spectroscopy, electron_paramagnetic_resonance and nuclear_magnetic_resonance
spectroscopy, is probably the most important 20th century development.
Further development in physical chemistry may be attributed to discoveries in
nuclear_chemistry, especially in isotope separation (before and during World
War II), more recent discoveries in astrochemistry,[12] as well as the
development of calculation algorithms in the field of "additive physicochemical
properties" (practically all physicochemical properties, such as boiling point,
critical point, surface tension, vapor pressure, etc.âmore than 20 in
allâcan be precisely calculated from chemical structure alone, even if the
chemical molecule remains unsynthesized),[citation_needed] and herein lies the
practical importance of contemporary physical chemistry.
