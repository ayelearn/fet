A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that
enables the formation of chemical_compounds. The bond may result from the
electrostatic_force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic
bonds or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent_bonds. The strength of
chemical bonds varies considerably; there are "strong bonds" or "primary bonds"
such as covalent, ionic and metallic bonds, and "weak bonds" or "secondary
bonds" such as dipoleÃ¢Â€Â“dipole_interactions, the London_dispersion_force and
hydrogen_bonding.
Since opposite charges attract via a simple electromagnetic_force, the
negatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively
charged protons in the nucleus attract each other. An electron positioned
between two nuclei will be attracted to both of them, and the nuclei will be
attracted toward electrons in this position. This attraction constitutes the
chemical bond. Due to the matter_wave nature of electrons and their smaller
mass, they must occupy a much larger amount of volume compared with the nuclei,
and this volume occupied by the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei in a bond
relatively far apart, as compared with the size of the nuclei themselves.
In general, strong chemical bonding is associated with the sharing or transfer
of electrons between the participating atoms. The atoms in molecules, crystals,
metals and diatomic gasesÃ¢Â€Â”indeed most of the physical environment around
usÃ¢Â€Â”are held together by chemical bonds, which dictate the structure and the
bulk properties of matter.
Examples of Lewis_dot-style representations of chemical bonds between carbon
(C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). Lewis dot diagrams were an early attempt to
describe chemical bonding and are still widely used today.
All bonds can be explained by quantum_theory, but, in practice, simplification
rules allow chemists to predict the strength, directionality, and polarity of
bonds. The octet_rule and VSEPR_theory are two examples. More sophisticated
theories are valence_bond_theory, which includes orbital_hybridization and
resonance, and molecular_orbital_theory which includes linear_combination_of
atomic_orbitals and ligand_field_theory. Electrostatics are used to describe
bond polarities and the effects they have on chemical substances.

***** Overview of main types of chemical bonds *****
A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms. This attraction may be seen as
the result of different behaviors of the outermost or valence_electrons of
atoms. These behaviors merge into each other seamlessly in various
circumstances, so that there is no clear line to be drawn between them. However
it remains useful and customary to differentiate between different types of
bond, which result in different properties of condensed_matter.
In the simplest view of a covalent_bond, one or more electrons (often a pair of
electrons) are drawn into the space between the two atomic nuclei. Energy is
released by bond formation. This is not as a reduction in potential energy,
because the attraction of the two electrons to the two protons is offset by the
electron-electron and proton-proton repulsions. Instead, the release of energy
(and hence stability of the bond) arises from the reduction in kinetic energy
due to the electrons being in a more spatially distributed (i.e. longer de
Broglie_wavelength) orbital compared with each electron being confined closer
to its respective nucleus.[1] These bonds exist between two particular
identifiable atoms and have a direction in space, allowing them to be shown as
single connecting lines between atoms in drawings, or modeled as sticks between
spheres in models.
In a polar_covalent_bond, one or more electrons are unequally shared between
two nuclei. Covalent bonds often result in the formation of small collections
of better-connected atoms called molecules, which in solids and liquids are
bound to other molecules by forces that are often much weaker than the covalent
bonds that hold the molecules internally together. Such weak intermolecular
bonds give organic molecular substances, such as waxes and oils, their soft
bulk character, and their low melting points (in liquids, molecules must cease
most structured or oriented contact with each other). When covalent bonds link
long chains of atoms in large molecules, however (as in polymers such as
nylon), or when covalent bonds extend in networks through solids that are not
composed of discrete molecules (such as diamond or quartz or the silicate
minerals in many types of rock) then the structures that result may be both
strong and tough, at least in the direction oriented correctly with networks of
covalent bonds. Also, the melting points of such covalent polymers and networks
increase greatly.
In a simplified view of an ionic_bond, the bonding electron is not shared at
all, but transferred. In this type of bond, the outer atomic_orbital of one
atom has a vacancy which allows the addition of one or more electrons. These
newly added electrons potentially occupy a lower energy-state (effectively
closer to more nuclear charge) than they experience in a different atom. Thus,
one nucleus offers a more tightly bound position to an electron than does
another nucleus, with the result that one atom may transfer an electron to the
other. This transfer causes one atom to assume a net positive charge, and the
other to assume a net negative charge. The bond then results from electrostatic
attraction between atoms and the atoms become positive or negatively charged
ions. Ionic bonds may be seen as extreme examples of polarization in covalent
bonds. Often, such bonds have no particular orientation in space, since they
result from equal electrostatic attraction of each ion to all ions around them.
Ionic bonds are strong (and thus ionic substances require high temperatures to
melt) but also brittle, since the forces between ions are short-range and do
not easily bridge cracks and fractures. This type of bond gives rise to the
physical characteristics of crystals of classic mineral salts, such as table
salt.
A less often mentioned type of bonding is metallic_bonding. In this type of
bonding, each atom in a metal donates one or more electrons to a "sea" of
electrons that reside between many metal atoms. In this sea, each electron is
free (by virtue of its wave_nature) to be associated with a great many atoms at
once. The bond results because the metal atoms become somewhat positively
charged due to loss of their electrons while the electrons remain attracted to
many atoms, without being part of any given atom. Metallic bonding may be seen
as an extreme example of delocalization of electrons over a large system of
covalent bonds, in which every atom participates. This type of bonding is often
very strong (resulting in the tensile_strength of metals). However, metallic
bonding is more collective in nature than other types, and so they allow metal
crystals to more easily deform, because they are composed of atoms attracted to
each other, but not in any particularly-oriented ways. This results in the
malleability of metals. The cloud of electrons in metallic bonding causes the
characteristically good electrical and thermal conductivity of metals, and also
their shiny lustre that reflects most frequencies of white light.
***** History *****
Main articles: History_of_chemistry and History_of_the_molecule
Early speculations about the nature of the chemical bond, from as early as the
12th century, supposed that certain types of chemical_species were joined by a
type of chemical_affinity. In 1704, Sir_Isaac_Newton famously outlined his
atomic bonding theory, in "Query 31" of his Opticks, whereby atoms attach to
each other by some "force". Specifically, after acknowledging the various
popular theories in vogue at the time, of how atoms were reasoned to attach to
each other, i.e. "hooked atoms", "glued together by rest", or "stuck together
by conspiring motions", Newton states that he would rather infer from their
cohesion, that "particles attract one another by some force, which in immediate
contact is exceedingly strong, at small distances performs the chemical
operations, and reaches not far from the particles with any sensible effect."
In 1819, on the heels of the invention of the voltaic_pile, JÃƒÂ¶ns_Jakob
Berzelius developed a theory of chemical combination stressing the
electronegative and electropositive characters of the combining atoms. By the
mid 19th century, Edward_Frankland, F.A._KekulÃƒÂ©, A.S. Couper, Alexander
Butlerov, and Hermann_Kolbe, building on the theory_of_radicals, developed the
theory_of_valency, originally called "combining power", in which compounds were
joined owing to an attraction of positive and negative poles. In 1916, chemist
Gilbert_N._Lewis developed the concept of the electron-pair_bond, in which two
atoms may share one to six electrons, thus forming the single_electron_bond, a
single_bond, a double_bond, or a triple_bond; in Lewis's own words, "An
electron may form a part of the shell of two different atoms and cannot be said
to belong to either one exclusively."[2]
That same year, Walther_Kossel put forward a theory similar to Lewis' only his
model assumed complete transfers of electrons between atoms, and was thus a
model of ionic_bonding. Both Lewis and Kossel structured their bonding models
on that of Abegg's_rule (1904).
Niels_Bohr proposed a_model_of_the_atom and a_model_of_the_chemical_bond.
According to his model for a diatomic_molecule, the electrons of the atoms of
the molecule form a rotating ring whose plane is perpendicular to the axis of
the molecule and equidistant from the atomic nuclei. The dynamic_equilibrium of
the molecular system is achieved through the balance of forces between the
forces of attraction of nuclei to the plane of the ring of electrons and the
forces of mutual repulsion of the nuclei. The Bohr model of the chemical bond
took into account the Coulomb_repulsion Ã¢Â€Â“ the electrons in the ring are at
the maximum distance from each other.[3][4]
In 1927, the first mathematically complete quantum description of a simple
chemical bond, i.e. that produced by one electron in the hydrogen molecular
ion, H2+, was derived by the Danish physicist ÃƒÂ˜yvind_Burrau.[5] This work
showed that the quantum approach to chemical bonds could be fundamentally and
quantitatively correct, but the mathematical methods used could not be extended
to molecules containing more than one electron. A more practical, albeit less
quantitative, approach was put forward in the same year by Walter_Heitler and
Fritz_London. The HeitlerÃ¢Â€Â“London method forms the basis of what is now called
valence_bond_theory. In 1929, the linear_combination_of_atomic_orbitals
molecular_orbital_method (LCAO) approximation was introduced by Sir John
Lennard-Jones, who also suggested methods to derive electronic structures of
molecules of F2 (fluorine) and O2 (oxygen) molecules, from basic quantum
principles. This molecular_orbital theory represented a covalent bond as an
orbital formed by combining the quantum mechanical SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger atomic orbitals
which had been hypothesized for electrons in single atoms. The equations for
bonding electrons in multi-electron atoms could not be solved to mathematical
perfection (i.e., analytically), but approximations for them still gave many
good qualitative predictions and results. Most quantitative calculations in
modern quantum_chemistry use either valence bond or molecular orbital theory as
a starting point, although a third approach, density_functional_theory, has
become increasingly popular in recent years.
In 1933, H. H. James and A. S. Coolidge carried out a calculation on the
dihydrogen molecule that, unlike all previous calculation which used functions
only of the distance of the electron from the atomic nucleus, used functions
which also explicitly added the distance between the two electrons.[6] With up
to 13 adjustable parameters they obtained a result very close to the
experimental result for the dissociation energy. Later extensions have used up
to 54 parameters and gave excellent agreement with experiments. This
calculation convinced the scientific community that quantum theory could give
agreement with experiment. However this approach has none of the physical
pictures of the valence bond and molecular orbital theories and is difficult to
extend to larger molecules.
***** Bonds in chemical formulas *****
Because atoms and molecules are three-dimensional, it is difficult to use a
single method to indicate orbitals and bonds. In molecular_formulas the
chemical bonds (binding orbitals) between atoms are indicated in different ways
depending on the type of discussion. Sometimes, some details are neglected. For
example, in organic_chemistry one is sometimes concerned only with the
functional_group of the molecule. Thus, the molecular formula of ethanol may be
written in conformational form, three-dimensional form, full two-dimensional
form (indicating every bond with no three-dimensional directions), compressed
two-dimensional form (CH3Ã¢Â€Â“CH2Ã¢Â€Â“OH), by separating the functional group from
another part of the molecule (C2H5OH), or by its atomic constituents (C2H6O),
according to what is discussed. Sometimes, even the non-bonding valence shell
electrons (with the two-dimensional approximate directions) are marked, e.g.
for elemental carbon .'C'. Some chemists may also mark the respective orbitals,
e.g. the hypothetical etheneÃ¢ÂˆÂ’4 anion (\/C=C/\ Ã¢ÂˆÂ’4) indicating the
possibility of bond formation.

Strong chemical bonds are the intramolecular forces that hold atoms together in
molecules. A strong chemical bond is formed from the transfer or sharing of
electrons between atomic centers and relies on the electrostatic_attraction
between the protons in nuclei and the electrons in the orbitals.
The types of strong bond differ due to the difference in electronegativity of
the constituent elements. A large difference in electronegativity leads to more
polar (ionic) character in the bond.
**** Ionic bond ****
Main article: Ionic_bonding
Ionic bonding is a type of electrostatic interaction between atoms that have a
large electronegativity difference. There is no precise value that
distinguishes ionic from covalent bonding, but an electronegativity difference
of over 1.7 is likely to be ionic while a difference of less than 1.7 is likely
to be covalent.[8] Ionic bonding leads to separate positive and negative ions.
Ionic charges are commonly between Ã¢ÂˆÂ’3e to +3e. Ionic bonding commonly occurs
in metal_salts such as sodium_chloride (table salt). A typical feature of ionic
bonds is that the species form into ionic crystals, in which no ion is
specifically paired with any single other ion in a specific directional bond.
Rather, each species of ion is surrounded by ions of the opposite charge, and
the spacing between it and each of the oppositely charged ions near it is the
same for all surrounding atoms of the same type. It is thus no longer possible
to associate an ion with any specific other single ionized atom near it. This
is a situation unlike that in covalent crystals, where covalent bonds between
specific atoms are still discernible from the shorter distances between them,
as measured via such techniques as X-ray_diffraction.
Ionic crystals may contain a mixture of covalent and ionic species, as for
example salts of complex acids such as sodium cyanide, NaCN. X-ray diffraction
shows that in NaCN, for example, the bonds between sodium cations (Na+) and the
cyanide anions (CNÃ¢ÂˆÂ’) are ionic, with no sodium ion associated with any
particular cyanide. However, the bonds between C and N atoms in cyanide are of
the covalent type, so that each carbon is strongly bound to just one nitrogen,
to which it is physically much closer than it is to other carbons or nitrogens
in a sodium cyanide crystal.
When such crystals are melted into liquids, the ionic bonds are broken first
because they are non-directional and allow the charged species to move freely.
Similarly, when such salts dissolve into water, the ionic bonds are typically
broken by the interaction with water but the covalent bonds continue to hold.
For example, in solution, the cyanide ions, still bound together as single
CNÃ¢ÂˆÂ’ ions, move independently through the solution, as do sodium ions, as Na+.
In water, charged ions move apart because each of them are more strongly
attracted to a number of water molecules than to each other. The attraction
between ions and water molecules in such solutions is due to a type of weak
dipole-dipole type chemical bond. In melted ionic compounds, the ions continue
to be attracted to each other, but not in any ordered or crystalline way.
**** Covalent bond ****
Main article: Covalent_bond
Non-polar covalent bonds in methane (CH4). The Lewis_structure shows electrons
shared between C and H atoms.
Covalent bonding is a common type of bonding in which two or more atoms share
valence_electrons more or less equally. The simplest and most common type is a
single_bond in which two atoms share two electrons. Other types include the
double_bond, the triple_bond, one-_and_three-electron_bonds, the three-center
two-electron_bond and three-center_four-electron_bond.
In non-polar covalent bonds, the electronegativity difference between the
bonded atoms is small, typically 0 to 0.3. Bonds within most organic_compounds
are described as covalent. The figure shows methane (CH4), in which each
hydrogen forms a covalent bond with the carbon. See sigma_bonds and pi_bonds
for LCAO descriptions of such bonding.
Molecules that are formed primarily from non-polar covalent bonds are often
immiscible in water or other polar_solvents, but much more soluble in non-polar
solvents such as hexane.
A polar_covalent_bond is a covalent bond with a significant ionic_character.
This means that the two shared electrons are closer to one of the atoms than
the other, creating an imbalance of charge. Such bonds occur between two atoms
with moderately different electronegativities and give rise to dipoleÃ¢Â€Â“dipole
interactions. The electronegativity difference between the two atoms in these
bonds is 0.3 to 1.7.
*** Single and multiple bonds ***
A single_bond between two atoms corresponds to the sharing of one pair of
electrons. The Hydrogen (H) atom has one valence electron. Two Hydrogen atoms
can then form a molecule, held together by the shared pair of electrons. Each H
atom now has the noble gas electron configuration of helium (He). The pair of
shared electrons forms a single covalent bond. The electron density of these
two bonding electrons in the region between the two atoms increases from the
density of two non-interacting H atoms.
Two p-orbitals forming a pi-bond.
A double_bond has two shared pairs of electrons, one in a sigma bond and one in
a pi_bond with electron density concentrated on two opposite sides of the
internuclear axis. A triple_bond consists of three shared electron pairs,
forming one sigma and two pi bonds. An example is nitrogen. Quadruple and
higher bonds are very rare and occur only between certain transition_metal
atoms.
*** Coordinate covalent bond (dipolar bond) ***
Adduct of ammonia and boron trifluoride
A coordinate_covalent_bond is a covalent bond in which the two shared bonding
electrons are from the same one of the atoms involved in the bond. For example,
boron_trifluoride (BF3) and ammonia (NH3) form an adduct or coordination
complex F3BÃ¢Â†ÂNH3 with a BÃ¢Â€Â“N bond in which a lone_pair of electrons on N is
shared with an empty atomic orbital on B. BF3 with an empty orbital is
described as an electron pair acceptor or Lewis_acid, while NH3 with a lone
pair that can be shared is described as an electron-pair donor or Lewis_base.
The electrons are shared roughly equally between the atoms in contrast to ionic
bonding. Such bonding is shown by an arrow pointing to the Lewis acid.
Transition_metal_complexes are generally bound by coordinate covalent bonds.
For example, the ion Ag+ reacts as a Lewis acid with two molecules of the Lewis
base NH3 to form the complex ion Ag(NH3)2+, which has two AgÃ¢Â†ÂN coordinate
covalent bonds.
**** Metallic bonding ****
Main article: Metallic_bonding
In metallic bonding, bonding electrons are delocalized over a lattice of atoms.
By contrast, in ionic compounds, the locations of the binding electrons and
their charges are static. The free movement or delocalization of bonding
electrons leads to classical metallic properties such as luster (surface light
reflectivity), electrical and thermal_conductivity, ductility, and high tensile
strength.
***** Intermolecular bonding *****
Main article: Intermolecular_force
There are four basic types of bonds that can be formed between two or more
(otherwise non-associated) molecules, ions or atoms. Intermolecular_forces
cause molecules to be attracted or repulsed by each other. Often, these define
some of the physical characteristics (such as the melting_point) of a
substance.
    * A large difference in electronegativity between two bonded atoms will
      cause a permanent charge separation, or dipole, in a molecule or ion. Two
      or more molecules or ions with permanent dipoles can interact within
      dipole-dipole_interactions. The bonding electrons in a molecule or ion
      will, on average, be closer to the more electronegative atom more
      frequently than the less electronegative one, giving rise to partial
      charges on each atom and causing electrostatic_forces between molecules
      or ions.
    * A hydrogen_bond is effectively a strong example of an interaction between
      two permanent dipoles. The large difference in electronegativities
      between hydrogen and any of fluorine, nitrogen and oxygen, coupled with
      their lone pairs of electrons, cause strong electrostatic forces between
      molecules. Hydrogen bonds are responsible for the high boiling points of
      water and ammonia with respect to their heavier analogues.
    * The London_dispersion_force arises due to instantaneous dipoles in
      neighbouring atoms. As the negative charge of the electron is not uniform
      around the whole atom, there is always a charge imbalance. This small
      charge will induce a corresponding dipole in a nearby molecule, causing
      an attraction between the two. The electron then moves to another part of
      the electron_cloud and the attraction is broken.
    * A cationÃ¢Â€Â“pi_interaction occurs between a pi_bond and a cation.
***** Theories of chemical bonding *****
In the (unrealistic) limit of "pure" ionic_bonding, electrons are perfectly
localized on one of the two atoms in the bond. Such bonds can be understood by
classical_physics. The forces between the atoms are characterized by isotropic
continuum electrostatic potentials. Their magnitude is in simple proportion to
the charge difference.
Covalent bonds are better understood by valence_bond_(VB)_theory or molecular
orbital_(MO)_theory. The properties of the atoms involved can be understood
using concepts such as oxidation_number, formal_charge, and electronegativity.
The electron density within a bond is not assigned to individual atoms, but is
instead delocalized between atoms. In valence bond theory, bonding is
conceptualized as being built up from electron pairs that are localized and
shared by two atoms via the overlap of atomic orbitals. The concepts of orbital
hybridization and resonance augment this basic notion of the electron pair
bond. In molecular orbital theory, bonding is viewed as being delocalized and
apportioned in orbitals that extend throughout the molecule and are adapted to
its symmetry properties, typically by considering linear_combinations_of_atomic
orbitals (LCAO). Valence bond theory is more chemically intuitive by being
spatially localized, allowing attention to be focused on the parts of the
molecule undergoing chemical change. In contrast, molecular orbitals are more
"natural" from a quantum mechanical point of view, with orbital energies being
physically significant and directly linked to experimental ionization energies
from photoelectron_spectroscopy. Consequently, valence bond theory and
molecular orbital theory are often viewed as competing but complementary
frameworks that offer different insights into chemical systems. As approaches
for electronic structure theory, both MO and VB methods can give approximations
to any desired level of accuracy, at least in principle. However, at lower
levels, the approximations differ, and one approach may be better suited for
computations involving a particular system or property than the other.
Unlike the spherically symmetrical Coulombic forces in pure ionic bonds,
covalent bonds are generally directed and anisotropic. These are often
classified based on their symmetry with respect to a molecular plane as sigma
bonds and pi_bonds. In the general case, atoms form bonds that are intermediate
between ionic and covalent, depending on the relative electronegativity of the
atoms involved. Bonds of this type are known as polar_covalent_bonds.
