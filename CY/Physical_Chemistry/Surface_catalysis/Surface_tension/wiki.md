Surface tension is the tendency of fluid surfaces to shrink into the minimum
surface_area possible. Surface tension allows insects (e.g. water_striders),
usually denser than water, to float and slide on a water surface.
At liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìair interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction
of liquid molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in
the air (due to adhesion). The net effect is an inward force at its surface
that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a
stretched elastic membrane. Thus, the surface comes under tension from the
imbalanced forces, which is probably where the term "surface tension" came
from.[1] Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules to each
other through a web of hydrogen bonds, water has a higher surface tension (72.8
millinewtons per meter at 20¬†√Ç¬∞C) than most other liquids. Surface tension is
an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.
Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length, or of energy per
unit area. The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of
area, it is common to use the term surface_energy, which is a more general term
in the sense that it applies also to solids.
In materials_science, surface tension is used for either surface_stress or
surface_energy.

***** Causes[edit] *****
Diagram of the forces on molecules of a liquid
Due to the cohesive_forces a molecule is pulled equally in every direction by
neighbouring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules
at the surface do not have the same molecules on all sides of them and
therefore are pulled inward. This creates some internal_pressure and forces
liquid surfaces to contract to the minimum area. The forces of attraction
acting between the molecules of same type are called cohesive forces while
those acting between the molecules of different types are called adhesive
forces. The balance between the cohesion of the liquid and its adhesion to the
material of the container determines the degree of wetting, the contact_angle
and the shape of meniscus. When cohesion dominates (specifically, cohesion
energy is more than double of adhesion energy) the wetting is low and the
meniscus is convex at a vertical wall (as for mercury in a glass container). On
the other hand, when adhesion dominates (adhesion energy more than half of
cohesion energy) the wetting is high and the similar meniscus is concave (as in
water in a glass).
Surface tension is responsible for the shape of liquid droplets. Although
easily deformed, droplets of water tend to be pulled into a spherical shape by
the imbalance in cohesive forces of the surface layer. In the absence of other
forces, including gravity, drops of virtually all liquids would be
approximately spherical. The spherical shape minimizes the necessary "wall
tension" of the surface layer according to Laplace's_law.

floating below the textile
Another way to view surface tension is in terms of energy. A molecule in
contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone
(not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors
as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors
(compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the
liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary
molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results
in a minimal surface area.[2] As a result of surface area minimization, a
surface will assume the smoothest shape it can (mathematical proof that
"smooth" shapes minimize surface area relies on use of the Euler√¢¬Ä¬ìLagrange
equation). Since any curvature in the surface shape results in greater area, a
higher energy will also result. Consequently, the surface will push back
against any curvature in much the same way as a ball pushed uphill will push
back to minimize_its_gravitational_potential_energy.
***** Effects of surface tension[edit] *****
**** Water[edit] ****
Several effects of surface tension can be seen with ordinary water:
   1. Beading of rain water on a waxy surface, such as a leaf. Water adheres
      weakly to wax and strongly to itself, so water clusters into drops.
      Surface tension gives them their near-spherical shape, because a sphere
      has the smallest possible surface_area_to_volume_ratio.
   2. Formation of drops occurs when a mass of liquid is stretched. The
      animation (below) shows water adhering to the faucet gaining mass until
      it is stretched to a point where the surface tension can no longer keep
      the drop linked to the faucet. It then separates and surface tension
      forms the drop into a sphere. If a stream of water were running from the
      faucet, the stream would break up into drops during its fall. Gravity
      stretches the stream, then surface tension pinches it into spheres.[3]
   3. Flotation of objects denser than water occurs when the object is
      nonwettable and its weight is small enough to be borne by the forces
      arising from surface tension.[2] For example, water_striders use surface
      tension to walk on the surface of a pond in the following way. The
      nonwettability of the water strider's leg means there is no attraction
      between molecules of the leg and molecules of the water, so when the leg
      pushes down on the water, the surface tension of the water only tries to
      recover its flatness from its deformation due to the leg. This behavior
      of the water pushes the water strider upward so it can stand on the
      surface of the water as long as its mass is small enough that the water
      can support it. The surface of the water behaves like an elastic film:
      the insect's feet cause indentations in the water's surface, increasing
      its surface area[4] and tendency of minimization of surface curvature (so
      area) of the water pushes the insect's feet upward.
   4. Separation of oil and water (in this case, water and liquid wax) is
      caused by a tension in the surface between dissimilar liquids. This type
      of surface tension is called "interface tension", but its chemistry is
      the same.
   5. Tears_of_wine is the formation of drops and rivulets on the side of a
      glass containing an alcoholic beverage. Its cause is a complex
      interaction between the differing surface tensions of water and ethanol;
      it is induced by a combination of surface tension modification of water
      by ethanol together with ethanol evaporating faster than water.

    * D. Lava_lamp with interaction between dissimilar liquids: water and
      liquid wax
    * E. Photo showing the "tears_of_wine" phenomenon.
**** Surfactants[edit] ****
Surface tension is visible in other common phenomena, especially when
surfactants are used to decrease it:
    * Soap bubbles have very large surface areas with very little mass. Bubbles
      in pure water are unstable. The addition of surfactants, however, can
      have a stabilizing effect on the bubbles (see Marangoni_effect). Note
      that surfactants actually reduce the surface tension of water by a factor
      of three or more.
    * Emulsions are a type of colloid in which surface tension plays a role.
      Tiny fragments of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble
      themselves into much larger masses. But the presence of a surfactant
      provides a decrease in surface tension, which permits stability of minute
      droplets of oil in the bulk of water (or vice versa).
***** Physics[edit] *****
**** Physical units[edit] ****
Surface tension, represented by the symbol √é¬≥ (alternatively √è¬É or T), is
measured in force per unit_length. Its SI unit is newton per meter but the cgs
unit of dyne per centimeter is also used. For example,[5]
         &#x03B3; = 1 &#xA0;    d y n   c m    = 1 &#xA0;    e r g   c  m  2
      = 1 &#xA0;     10  &#x2212; 7    m &#x22C5; N    10  &#x2212; 4     m  2
      = 0.001 &#xA0;   N m   = 0.001 &#xA0;   J  m  2     .   {\displaystyle
      \gamma =1~\mathrm {\frac {dyn}{cm}} =1~\mathrm {\frac {erg}{cm^{2}}}
      =1~\mathrm {\frac {10^{-7}\,m\cdot N}{10^{-4}\,m^{2}}} =0.001~\mathrm
      {\frac {N}{m}} =0.001~\mathrm {\frac {J}{m^{2}}} .}  [{\displaystyle
      \gamma =1~\mathrm {\frac {dyn}{cm}} =1~\mathrm {\frac {erg}{cm^{2}}}
      =1~\mathrm {\frac {10^{-7}\,m\cdot N}{10^{-4}\,m^{2}}} =0.001~\mathrm
      {\frac {N}{m}} =0.001~\mathrm {\frac {J}{m^{2}}} .}]
**** Surface area growth[edit] ****
This diagram illustrates the force necessary to increase the surface area. This
force is proportional to the surface tension.
Surface tension can be defined in terms of force or energy.
*** In terms of force[edit] ***
Surface tension √é¬≥ of a liquid is the force per unit length. In the
illustration on the right, the rectangular frame, composed of three unmovable
sides (black) that form a "U" shape, and a fourth movable side (blue) that can
slide to the right. Surface tension will pull the blue bar to the left; the
force F required to hold the immobile side is proportional to the length L of
the movable side. Thus the ratio F/L depends only on the intrinsic properties
of the liquid (composition, temperature, etc.), not on its geometry. For
example, if the frame had a more complicated shape, the ratio F/L, with L the
length of the movable side and F the force required to stop it from sliding, is
found to be the same for all shapes. We therefore define the surface tension as
         &#x03B3; =   1 2     F L   .   {\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{2}}
      {\frac {F}{L}}.}  [{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {F}{L}}.}]
The reason for the 1/2 is that the film has two sides (two surfaces), each of
which contributes equally to the force; so the force contributed by a single
side is √é¬≥L = F/2.
*** In terms of energy[edit] ***
Surface tension √é¬≥ of a liquid is the ratio of the change in the energy of the
liquid, and the change in the surface area of the liquid (that led to the
change in energy). This can be easily related to the previous definition in
terms of force:[6] if F is the force required to stop the side from starting to
slide, then this is also the force that would keep the side in the state of
sliding at a constant speed (by Newton's Second Law). But if the side is moving
to the right (in the direction the force is applied), then the surface area of
the stretched liquid is increasing while the applied force is doing work on the
liquid. This means that increasing the surface area increases the energy of the
film. The work done by the force F in moving the side by distance √é¬îx is W =
F√é¬îx; at the same time the total area of the film increases by √é¬îA = 2L√é¬îx (the
factor of 2 is here because the liquid has two sides, two surfaces). Thus,
multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of √é¬≥ = 1/2F/L by √é¬îx, we
get
         &#x03B3; =   F  2 L    =    F &#x0394; x   2 L &#x0394; x    =   W
      &#x0394; A      {\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {F}{2L}}={\frac {F\Delta x}
      {2L\Delta x}}={\frac {W}{\Delta A}}}  [\gamma=\frac{F}{2L}=\frac{F \Delta
      x}{2 L \Delta x}=\frac{W}{\Delta A} ].
This work W is, by the usual_arguments, interpreted as being stored as
potential energy. Consequently, surface tension can be also measured in SI
system as joules per square meter and in the cgs system as ergs per cm2. Since
mechanical_systems_try_to_find_a_state_of_minimum_potential_energy, a free
droplet of liquid naturally assumes a spherical shape, which has the minimum
surface area for a given volume. The equivalence of measurement of energy per
unit area to force per unit length can be proven by dimensional_analysis.[7]
**** Surface curvature and pressure[edit] ****
Surface tension forces acting on a tiny (differential) patch of surface. √é¬¥√é¬∏x
and √é¬¥√é¬∏y indicate the amount of bend over the dimensions of the patch.
Balancing the tension forces with pressure leads to the Young√¢¬Ä¬ìLaplace
equation
If no force acts normal to a tensioned surface, the surface must remain flat.
But if the pressure on one side of the surface differs from pressure on the
other side, the pressure difference times surface area results in a normal
force. In order for the surface tension forces to cancel the force due to
pressure, the surface must be curved. The diagram shows how surface curvature
of a tiny patch of surface leads to a net component of surface tension forces
acting normal to the center of the patch. When all the forces are balanced, the
resulting equation is known as the Young√¢¬Ä¬ìLaplace_equation:[8]
         &#x0394; p = &#x03B3;  (    1  R  x     +   1  R  y      )
      {\displaystyle \Delta p=\gamma \left({\frac {1}{R_{x}}}+{\frac {1}{R_
      {y}}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle \Delta p=\gamma \left({\frac {1}{R_{x}}}+
      {\frac {1}{R_{y}}}\right)}]
where:
    * √é¬îp is the pressure difference, known as the Laplace_pressure.[9]
    * √é¬≥ is surface tension.
    * Rx and Ry are radii_of_curvature in each of the axes that are parallel to
      the surface.
The quantity in parentheses on the right hand side is in fact (twice) the mean
curvature of the surface (depending on normalisation). Solutions to this
equation determine the shape of water drops, puddles, menisci, soap bubbles,
and all other shapes determined by surface tension (such as the shape of the
impressions that a water strider's feet make on the surface of a pond). The
table below shows how the internal pressure of a water droplet increases with
decreasing radius. For not very small drops the effect is subtle, but the
pressure difference becomes enormous when the drop sizes approach the molecular
size. (In the limit of a single molecule the concept becomes meaningless.)

**** Floating objects[edit] ****
Cross-section of a needle floating on the surface of water. Fw is the weight
and Fs are surface tension resultant forces.
When an object is placed on a liquid, its weight Fw depresses the surface, and
if surface tension and downward force becomes equal than is balanced by the
surface tension forces on either side Fs, which are each parallel to the
water's surface at the points where it contacts the object. Notice that small
movement in the body may cause the object to sink. As the angle of contact
decreases surface tension decreases the horizontal components of the two Fs
arrows point in opposite directions, so they cancel each other, but the
vertical components point in the same direction and therefore add up[2] to
balance Fw. The object's surface must not be wettable for this to happen, and
its weight must be low enough for the surface tension to support it.

      \Leftrightarrow \quad \rho _{\mathrm {w} }A_{\mathrm {w} }Lg=2\gamma
      L\cos \theta }]
**** Liquid surface[edit] ****
Minimal surface
To find the shape of the minimal_surface bounded by some arbitrary shaped frame
using strictly mathematical means can be a daunting task. Yet by fashioning the
frame out of wire and dipping it in soap-solution, a locally minimal surface
will appear in the resulting soap-film within seconds.[7][10]
The reason for this is that the pressure difference across a fluid interface is
proportional to the mean_curvature, as seen in the Young√¢¬Ä¬ìLaplace_equation.
For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean
curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean
curvature.
**** Contact angles[edit] ****
Main article: Contact_angle
The surface of any liquid is a interface between that liquid and some other
medium.[note_1] The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between
the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the
liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If
a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top
surface, there is also an interface between the liquid and the walls of the
container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different
(greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the
two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.[7][8]
Forces at contact point shown for contact angle greater than 90√Ç¬∞ (left) and
less than 90√Ç¬∞ (right)
Where the two surfaces meet, they form a contact_angle, √é¬∏, which is the angle
the tangent to the surface makes with the solid surface. Note that the angle is
measured through the liquid, as shown in the diagrams above. The diagram to the
right shows two examples. Tension forces are shown for the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìair
interface, the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìsolid interface, and the solid√¢¬Ä¬ìair interface. The
example on the left is where the difference between the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìsolid and
solid√¢¬Ä¬ìair surface tension, √é¬≥ls √¢¬à¬í √é¬≥sa, is less than the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìair
surface tension, √é¬≥la, but is nevertheless positive, that is
          &#x03B3;   l a    >  &#x03B3;   l s    &#x2212;  &#x03B3;   s a    >
      0   {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {la} }>\gamma _{\mathrm {ls} }-\gamma
      _{\mathrm {sa} }>0}  [{\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {la} }>\gamma _
      {\mathrm {ls} }-\gamma _{\mathrm {sa} }>0}]
In the diagram, both the vertical and horizontal forces must cancel exactly at
the contact point, known as equilibrium. The horizontal component of fla is
canceled by the adhesive force, fA.[7]
          f   A    =  f   l a    sin &#x2061; &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle f_
      {\mathrm {A} }=f_{\mathrm {la} }\sin \theta }  [{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm
      {A} }=f_{\mathrm {la} }\sin \theta }]
The more telling balance of forces, though, is in the vertical direction. The
vertical component of fla must exactly cancel the difference of the forces
along the solid surface, fls √¢¬à¬í fsa.[7]
          f   l s    &#x2212;  f   s a    = &#x2212;  f   l a    cos &#x2061;
      &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {ls} }-f_{\mathrm {sa} }=-f_{\mathrm
      {la} }\cos \theta }  [{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {ls} }-f_{\mathrm {sa}
      }=-f_{\mathrm {la} }\cos \theta }]

Since the forces are in direct proportion to their respective surface tensions,
we also have:[8]
          &#x03B3;   l s    &#x2212;  &#x03B3;   s a    = &#x2212;  &#x03B3;
      l a    cos &#x2061; &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {ls} }-
      \gamma _{\mathrm {sa} }=-\gamma _{\mathrm {la} }\cos \theta }  [
      {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {ls} }-\gamma _{\mathrm {sa} }=-\gamma _
      {\mathrm {la} }\cos \theta }]
where
    * √é¬≥ls is the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìsolid surface tension,
    * √é¬≥la is the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìair surface tension,
    * √é¬≥sa is the solid√¢¬Ä¬ìair surface tension,
    * √é¬∏ is the contact angle, where a concave meniscus has contact angle less
      than 90√Ç¬∞ and a convex meniscus has contact angle of greater than 90√Ç¬∞.
      [7]
This means that although the difference between the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìsolid and
solid√¢¬Ä¬ìair surface tension, √é¬≥ls √¢¬à¬í √é¬≥sa, is difficult to measure directly,
it can be inferred from the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìair surface tension, √é¬≥la, and the
equilibrium contact angle, √é¬∏, which is a function of the easily measurable
advancing and receding contact angles (see main article contact_angle).
This same relationship exists in the diagram on the right. But in this case we
see that because the contact angle is less than 90√Ç¬∞, the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìsolid/
solid√¢¬Ä¬ìair surface tension difference must be negative:
          &#x03B3;   l a    > 0 >  &#x03B3;   l s    &#x2212;  &#x03B3;   s a
      {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {la} }>0>\gamma _{\mathrm {ls} }-\gamma _
      {\mathrm {sa} }}  [{\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {la} }>0>\gamma _
      {\mathrm {ls} }-\gamma _{\mathrm {sa} }}]
*** Special contact angles[edit] ***
Observe that in the special case of a water√¢¬Ä¬ìsilver interface where the
contact angle is equal to 90√Ç¬∞, the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìsolid/solid√¢¬Ä¬ìair surface tension
difference is exactly zero.
Another special case is where the contact angle is exactly 180√Ç¬∞. Water with
specially prepared Teflon approaches this.[8] Contact angle of 180√Ç¬∞ occurs
when the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìsolid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìair
surface tension.
          &#x03B3;   l a    =  &#x03B3;   l s    &#x2212;  &#x03B3;   s a    >
      0  &#x03B8; =  180  &#x2218;     {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {la}

      }-\gamma _{\mathrm {sa} }>0\qquad \theta =180^{\circ }}]
***** Methods of measurement[edit] *****
Surface tension can be measured using the pendant drop method on a goniometer.
Because surface tension manifests itself in various effects, it offers a number
of paths to its measurement. Which method is optimal depends upon the nature of
the liquid being measured, the conditions under which its tension is to be
measured, and the stability of its surface when it is deformed.
    * Du_No√É¬ºy_ring_method: The traditional method used to measure surface or
      interfacial tension. Wetting properties of the surface or interface have
      little influence on this measuring technique. Maximum pull exerted on the
      ring by the surface is measured.[11]
    * Du_No√É¬ºy√¢¬Ä¬ìPadday_method: A minimized version of Du No√É¬ºy method uses a
      small diameter metal needle instead of a ring, in combination with a high
      sensitivity microbalance to record maximum pull. The advantage of this
      method is that very small sample volumes (down to few tens of
      microliters) can be measured with very high precision, without the need
      to correct for buoyancy (for a needle or rather, rod, with proper
      geometry). Further, the measurement can be performed very quickly,
      minimally in about 20 seconds. First commercial multichannel tensiometers
      [CMCeeker] were recently built based on this principle.
    * Wilhelmy_plate_method: A universal method especially suited to check
      surface tension over long time intervals. A vertical plate of known
      perimeter is attached to a balance, and the force due to wetting is
      measured.[12]
    * Spinning_drop_method: This technique is ideal for measuring low
      interfacial tensions. The diameter of a drop within a heavy phase is
      measured while both are rotated.
    * Pendant_drop_method: Surface and interfacial tension can be measured by
      this technique, even at elevated temperatures and pressures. Geometry of
      a drop is analyzed optically. For pendant drops the maximum diameter and
      the ratio between this parameter and the diameter at the distance of the
      maximum diameter from the drop apex has been used to evaluate the size
      and shape parameters in order to determine surface tension.
    * Bubble_pressure_method (Jaeger's method): A measurement technique for
      determining surface tension at short surface ages. Maximum pressure of
      each bubble is measured.
    * Drop volume method: A method for determining interfacial tension as a
      function of interface age. Liquid of one density is pumped into a second
      liquid of a different density and time between drops produced is
      measured.[13]
    * Capillary rise method: The end of a capillary is immersed into the
      solution. The height at which the solution reaches inside the capillary
      is related to the surface tension by the equation discussed_below.[14]
    * Stalagmometric_method: A method of weighting and reading a drop of
      liquid.
    * Sessile_drop_method: A method for determining surface tension and density
      by placing a drop on a substrate and measuring the contact_angle (see
      Sessile_drop_technique).[15]
    * Vibrational frequency of levitated drops: The natural frequency of
      vibrational oscillations of magnetically levitated drops has been used to
      measure the surface tension of superfluid 4He. This value is estimated to
      be 0.375¬†dyn/cm at T = 0¬†K.[16]
    * Resonant oscillations of spherical and hemispherical liquid drop: The
      technique is based on measuring the resonant frequency of spherical and
      hemispherical pendant droplets driven in oscillations by a modulated
      electric field. The surface tension and viscosity can be evaluated from
      the obtained resonant curves.[17][18][19]
***** Effects[edit] *****
**** Liquid in a vertical tube[edit] ****
Main article: Capillary_action
Diagram of a mercury barometer
An old style mercury barometer consists of a vertical glass tube about 1¬†cm in
diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's
vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the
mercury level at the center of the tube is higher than at the edges, making the
upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire
column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury
were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top
gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two
effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is
known as a convex meniscus.
We consider the surface area of the entire mass of mercury, including the part
of the surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not
adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its
entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If
instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very
different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the
level of mercury at the center of the tube will be lower than at the edges
(that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid
adheres to the walls of its container, we consider the part of the fluid's
surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface
tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this
case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than
increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the
increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of
the container.
Illustration of capillary rise and fall. Red=contact angle less than 90√Ç¬∞;
blue=contact angle greater than 90√Ç¬∞
If a tube is sufficiently narrow and the liquid adhesion to its walls is
sufficiently strong, surface tension can draw liquid up the tube in a
phenomenon known as capillary_action. The height to which the column is lifted
is given by Jurin's_law:[7]
         h =    2  &#x03B3;   l a    cos &#x2061; &#x03B8;   &#x03C1; g r
      {\displaystyle h={\frac {2\gamma _{\mathrm {la} }\cos \theta }{\rho gr}}}
      [{\displaystyle h={\frac {2\gamma _{\mathrm {la} }\cos \theta }{\rho
      gr}}}]
where
    * h is the height the liquid is lifted,
    * √é¬≥la is the liquid√¢¬Ä¬ìair surface tension,
    * √è¬Å is the density of the liquid,
    * r is the radius of the capillary,
    * g is the acceleration due to gravity,
    * √é¬∏ is the angle of contact described above. If √é¬∏ is greater than 90√Ç¬∞,
      as with mercury in a glass container, the liquid will be depressed rather
      than lifted.
**** Puddles on a surface[edit] ****
Profile curve of the edge of a puddle where the contact angle is 180√Ç¬∞. The
curve is given by the formula:[8]
   x &#x2212;  x  0   =   1 2   H  cosh  &#x2212; 1   &#x2061;  (   H h   )
&#x2212; H   1 &#x2212;    h  2    H  2         {\displaystyle x-x_{0}={\frac
{1}{2}}H\cosh ^{-1}\left({\frac {H}{h}}\right)-H{\sqrt {1-{\frac {h^{2}}{H^
{2}}}}}}  [{\displaystyle x-x_{0}={\frac {1}{2}}H\cosh ^{-1}\left({\frac {H}
{h}}\right)-H{\sqrt {1-{\frac {h^{2}}{H^{2}}}}}}]
where     H = 2    &#x03B3;  g &#x03C1;       {\displaystyle H=2{\sqrt {\frac
{\gamma }{g\rho }}}}  [{\displaystyle H=2{\sqrt {\frac {\gamma }{g\rho }}}}]
Small puddles of water on a smooth clean surface have perceptible thickness.
Pouring mercury onto a horizontal flat sheet of glass results in a puddle that
has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only to the point where
it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due
to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out
because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but
the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface
area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.
The same surface tension demonstration can be done with water, lime water or
even saline, but only on a surface made of a substance to which water does not
adhere. Wax is such a substance. Water poured onto a smooth, flat, horizontal
wax surface, say a waxed sheet of glass, will behave similarly to the mercury
poured onto glass.
The thickness of a puddle of liquid on a surface whose contact angle is 180√Ç¬∞
is given by:[8]
         h = 2    &#x03B3;  g &#x03C1;       {\displaystyle h=2{\sqrt {\frac
      {\gamma }{g\rho }}}}  [{\displaystyle h=2{\sqrt {\frac {\gamma }{g\rho
      }}}}]
where
    * h is the depth of the puddle in centimeters or meters.
    * √é¬≥ is the surface tension of the liquid in dynes per centimeter or
      newtons per meter.
    * g is the acceleration due to gravity and is equal to 980¬†cm/s2 or 9.8¬†m/
      s2
    * √è¬Å is the density of the liquid in grams per cubic centimeter or
      kilograms per cubic meter
Illustration of how lower contact angle leads to reduction of puddle depth
In reality, the thicknesses of the puddles will be slightly less than what is
predicted by the above formula because very few surfaces have a contact angle
of 180√Ç¬∞ with any liquid. When the contact angle is less than 180√Ç¬∞, the
thickness is given by:[8]
         h =     2  &#x03B3;   l a     (  1 &#x2212; cos &#x2061; &#x03B8;  )
      g &#x03C1;     .   {\displaystyle h={\sqrt {\frac {2\gamma _{\mathrm {la}
      }\left(1-\cos \theta \right)}{g\rho }}}.}  [{\displaystyle h={\sqrt
      {\frac {2\gamma _{\mathrm {la} }\left(1-\cos \theta \right)}{g\rho }}}.}]
For mercury on glass, √é¬≥Hg = 487 dyn/cm, √è¬ÅHg = 13.5 g/cm3 and √é¬∏ = 140√Ç¬∞,
which gives hHg = 0.36¬†cm. For water on paraffin at 25¬†√Ç¬∞C, √é¬≥ = 72 dyn/cm, √è¬Å
= 1.0 g/cm3, and √é¬∏ = 107√Ç¬∞ which gives hH2O = 0.44¬†cm.
The formula also predicts that when the contact angle is 0√Ç¬∞, the liquid will
spread out into a micro-thin layer over the surface. Such a surface is said to
be fully wettable by the liquid.
**** The breakup of streams into drops[edit] ****
Intermediate stage of a jet breaking into drops. Radii of curvature in the
axial direction are shown. Equation for the radius of the stream is R(z) = R0 +
Ak cos (kz), where R0 is the radius of the unperturbed stream, Ak is the
amplitude of the perturbation, z is distance along the axis of the stream, and
k is the wave number
Main article: Plateau√¢¬Ä¬ìRayleigh_instability
In day-to-day life all of us observe that a stream of water emerging from a
faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is
emitted from the faucet. This is due to a phenomenon called the
Plateau√¢¬Ä¬ìRayleigh_instability,[8] which is entirely a consequence of the
effects of surface tension.
The explanation of this instability begins with the existence of tiny
perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the
stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we
find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among
those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a
component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its
wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the
radii of the original cylindrical stream.
***** Thermodynamics[edit] *****
**** Thermodynamic theories of surface tension[edit] ****
J.W._Gibbs developed the thermodynamic theory of capillarity based on the idea
of surfaces of discontinuity.[20] He introduced and studied thermodynamics of
two-dimensional objects √¢¬Ä¬ì surfaces. These surfaces have area, mass, entropy,
energy and free energy. As stated above, the mechanical work needed to increase
a surface area A is dW = √é¬≥ dA. Hence at constant temperature and pressure,
surface tension equals Gibbs_free_energy per surface area:[8]
         &#x03B3; =   (    &#x2202; G   &#x2202; A    )   T , P , n
      {\displaystyle \gamma =\left({\frac {\partial G}{\partial A}}\right)_
      {T,P,n}}  [\gamma = \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial A} \right)_{T,P,n}]
where G is Gibbs free energy and A is the area.
Thermodynamics requires that for systems held at constant pressure and
temperature all spontaneous changes of state are accompanied by a decrease in
Gibbs free energy.
From this it is easy to understand why decreasing the surface area of a mass of
liquid is always spontaneous (G < 0), provided it is not coupled to any other
energy changes. It follows that in order to increase surface area, a certain
amount of energy must be added.
Gibbs free energy is defined by the equation[21] G = H √¢¬à¬í TS, where H is
enthalpy and S is entropy. Based upon this and the fact that surface tension is
Gibbs free energy per unit area, it is possible to obtain the following
expression for entropy per unit area:
           (    &#x2202; &#x03B3;   &#x2202; T    )   A , P   = &#x2212;  S  A
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \gamma }{\partial T}}\right)_
      {A,P}=-S^{A}}  [\left( \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial T} \right)_{A,P}=-
      S^{A}]
Kelvin's equation for surfaces arises by rearranging the previous equations. It
states that surface enthalpy or surface_energy (different from surface_free
energy) depends both on surface tension and its derivative with temperature at
constant pressure by the relationship.[22]
          H  A   = &#x03B3; &#x2212; T   (    &#x2202; &#x03B3;   &#x2202; T
      )   P     {\displaystyle H^{A}=\gamma -T\left({\frac {\partial \gamma }
      {\partial T}}\right)_{P}}  [{\displaystyle H^{A}=\gamma -T\left({\frac
      {\partial \gamma }{\partial T}}\right)_{P}}]
Fifteen years after Gibbs, J.D._van_der_Waals developed the theory of
capillarity effects based on the hypothesis of a continuous variation of
density.[23] He added to the energy density the term     c ( &#x2207; &#x03C1;
)  2   ,   {\displaystyle c(\nabla \rho )^{2},}  [{\displaystyle c(\nabla \rho
)^{2},}] where c is the capillarity coefficient and √è¬Å is the density. For the
multiphase equilibria, the results of the van der Waals approach practically
coincide with the Gibbs formulae, but for modelling of the dynamics of phase
transitions the van der Waals approach is much more convenient.[24][25] The van
der Waals capillarity energy is now widely used in the phase_field_models of
multiphase flows. Such terms are also discovered in the dynamics of non-
equilibrium gases.[26]
**** Thermodynamics of soap bubbles[edit] ****
The pressure inside an ideal (one surface) soap bubble can be derived from
thermodynamic free energy considerations. At constant temperature and particle
number, dT = dN = 0, the differential Helmholtz energy is given by
         d F = &#x2212; P  d V + &#x03B3;  d A   {\displaystyle dF=-
      P\,dV+\gamma \,dA}  [{\displaystyle dF=-P\,dV+\gamma \,dA}]
where P is the difference in pressure inside and outside of the bubble, and √é¬≥
is the surface tension. In equilibrium, dF = 0, and so,
         P  d V = &#x03B3;  d A   {\displaystyle P\,dV=\gamma \,dA}  [
      {\displaystyle P\,dV=\gamma \,dA}].
For a spherical bubble, the volume and surface area are given simply by
         V =    4 3    &#x03C0;  R  3    &#x2192;  d V &#x2248; 4 &#x03C0;  R
      2    d R ,   {\displaystyle V={\tfrac {4}{3}}\pi R^{3}\quad \rightarrow
      \quad dV\approx 4\pi R^{2}\,dR,}  [{\displaystyle V={\tfrac {4}{3}}\pi R^
      {3}\quad \rightarrow \quad dV\approx 4\pi R^{2}\,dR,}]
and
         A = 4 &#x03C0;  R  2    &#x2192;  d A &#x2248; 8 &#x03C0; R  d R .
      {\displaystyle A=4\pi R^{2}\quad \rightarrow \quad dA\approx 8\pi R\,dR.}
      [{\displaystyle A=4\pi R^{2}\quad \rightarrow \quad dA\approx 8\pi
      R\,dR.}]
Substituting these relations into the previous expression, we find
         P =   2 R   &#x03B3; ,   {\displaystyle P={\frac {2}{R}}\gamma ,}  [
      {\displaystyle P={\frac {2}{R}}\gamma ,}]
which is equivalent to the Young√¢¬Ä¬ìLaplace_equation when Rx = Ry. For real soap
bubbles, the pressure is doubled due to the presence of two interfaces, one
inside and one outside.
*** Influence of temperature[edit] ***
Temperature dependence of the surface tension between the liquid and vapor
phases of pure water
Temperature dependency of the surface tension of benzene
Surface tension is dependent on temperature. For that reason, when a value is
given for the surface tension of an interface, temperature must be explicitly
stated. The general trend is that surface tension decreases with the increase
of temperature, reaching a value of 0 at the critical_temperature. For further
details see E√É¬∂tv√É¬∂s_rule. There are only empirical equations to relate surface
tension and temperature:
    * E√É¬∂tv√É¬∂s:[11][22][27]
         &#x03B3;  V   2 3    = k (  T   C    &#x2212; T ) .   {\displaystyle
      \gamma V^{\frac {2}{3}}=k(T_{\mathrm {C} }-T).}  [{\displaystyle \gamma
      V^{\frac {2}{3}}=k(T_{\mathrm {C} }-T).}]
Here V is the molar volume of a substance, TC is the critical_temperature and k
is a constant valid for almost all substances.[11] A typical value is k =
2.1√É¬ó10√¢¬à¬í7¬†J K√¢¬à¬í1 mol√¢¬à¬í&#x200b;2‚ÅÑ3.[11][27] For water one can further use V
= 18¬†ml/mol and TC = 647¬†K (374¬†√Ç¬∞C).[28]
A variant on E√É¬∂tv√É¬∂s is described by Ramay and Shields:[21]
         &#x03B3;  V   2 3    = k  (   T   C    &#x2212; T &#x2212; 6  )
      {\displaystyle \gamma V^{\frac {2}{3}}=k\left(T_{\mathrm {C} }-T-
      6\right)}  [{\displaystyle \gamma V^{\frac {2}{3}}=k\left(T_{\mathrm {C}
      }-T-6\right)}]
where the temperature offset of 6 K provides the formula with a better fit to
reality at lower temperatures.
    * Guggenheim√¢¬Ä¬ìKatayama:[22]
         &#x03B3; =  &#x03B3;  &#x2218;     (  1 &#x2212;   T  T   C       )
      n     {\displaystyle \gamma =\gamma ^{\circ }\left(1-{\frac {T}{T_
      {\mathrm {C} }}}\right)^{n}}  [{\displaystyle \gamma =\gamma ^{\circ
      }\left(1-{\frac {T}{T_{\mathrm {C} }}}\right)^{n}}]
√é¬≥√Ç¬∞ is a constant for each liquid and n is an empirical factor, whose value is
11/9 for organic liquids. This equation was also proposed by van_der_Waals, who
further proposed that √é¬≥√Ç¬∞ could be given by the expression
          K  2    T   C     1 3     P   C     2 3    ,   {\displaystyle K_{2}T_
      {\mathrm {C} }^{\frac {1}{3}}P_{\mathrm {C} }^{\frac {2}{3}},}  [
      {\displaystyle K_{2}T_{\mathrm {C} }^{\frac {1}{3}}P_{\mathrm {C} }^
      {\frac {2}{3}},}]
where K2 is a universal constant for all liquids, and PC is the critical
pressure of the liquid (although later experiments found K2 to vary to some
degree from one liquid to another).[22]
Both Guggenheim√¢¬Ä¬ìKatayama and E√É¬∂tv√É¬∂s take into account the fact that surface
tension reaches 0 at the critical temperature, whereas Ramay and Shields fails
to match reality at this endpoint.
*** Influence of solute concentration[edit] ***
Solutes can have different effects on surface tension depending on the nature
of the surface and the solute:
    * Little or no effect, for example sugar at water|air, most organic
      compounds at oil|air
    * Increase surface tension, most inorganic_salts at water|air
    * Non-monotonic change, most inorganic acids at water|air
    * Decrease surface tension progressively, as with most amphiphiles, e.g.,
      alcohols at water|air
    * Decrease surface tension until certain critical concentration, and no
      effect afterwards: surfactants that form micelles
What complicates the effect is that a solute can exist in a different
concentration at the surface of a solvent than in its bulk. This difference
varies from one solute√¢¬Ä¬ìsolvent combination to another.
Gibbs_isotherm states that:
         &#x0393; = &#x2212;   1  R T      (    &#x2202; &#x03B3;   &#x2202; ln
      &#x2061; C    )   T , P     {\displaystyle \Gamma =-{\frac {1}{RT}}\left(
      {\frac {\partial \gamma }{\partial \ln C}}\right)_{T,P}}  [{\displaystyle
      \Gamma =-{\frac {1}{RT}}\left({\frac {\partial \gamma }{\partial \ln
      C}}\right)_{T,P}}]
    * √é¬ì is known as surface concentration, it represents excess of solute per
      unit area of the surface over what would be present if the bulk
      concentration prevailed all the way to the surface. It has units of mol/
      m2
    * C is the concentration of the substance in the bulk solution.
    * R is the gas_constant and T the temperature
Certain assumptions are taken in its deduction, therefore Gibbs isotherm can
only be applied to ideal (very dilute) solutions with two components.
*** Influence of particle size on vapor pressure[edit] ***
See also: Gibbs√¢¬Ä¬ìThomson_effect
The Clausius√¢¬Ä¬ìClapeyron_relation leads to another equation also attributed to
Kelvin, as the Kelvin_equation. It explains why, because of surface tension,
the vapor_pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension is greater than
standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That is
to say that when a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium
concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater. This arises because
the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.[21]
          P   v     f o g    =  P   v    &#x2218;    e    V 2 &#x03B3;   R T  r
      k          {\displaystyle P_{\mathrm {v} }^{\mathrm {fog} }=P_{\mathrm
      {v} }^{\circ }e^{\frac {V2\gamma }{RTr_{\mathrm {k} }}}}  [{\displaystyle
      P_{\mathrm {v} }^{\mathrm {fog} }=P_{\mathrm {v} }^{\circ }e^{\frac
      {V2\gamma }{RTr_{\mathrm {k} }}}}]
Molecules on the surface of a tiny droplet (left) have, on average, fewer
neighbors than those on a flat surface (right). Hence they are bound more
weakly to the droplet than are flat-surface molecules.
    * Pv√Ç¬∞ is the standard vapor pressure for that liquid at that temperature
      and pressure.
    * V is the molar volume.
    * R is the gas_constant
    * rk is the Kelvin radius, the radius of the droplets.
The effect explains supersaturation of vapors. In the absence of nucleation
sites, tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets.
This requires a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase
transition point.[21]
This equation is also used in catalyst chemistry to assess mesoporosity for
solids.[29]
The effect can be viewed in terms of the average number of molecular neighbors
of surface molecules (see diagram).
The table shows some calculated values of this effect for water at different
drop sizes:
 __________________________________________________
|P/P0_for_water_drops_of_different_radii_at_STP[22]|
|Droplet_radius_(nm)|1000_|100__|10___|1___________|
|P/P0_______________|1.001|1.011|1.114|2.95________|
The effect becomes clear for very small drop sizes, as a drop of 1¬†nm radius
has about 100 molecules inside, which is a quantity small enough to require a
quantum_mechanics analysis.
***** Surface tension of water and of seawater[edit] *****
The two most abundant liquids on the Earth are fresh water and seawater. This
section gives correlations of reference data for the surface tension of both.
**** Surface tension of water[edit] ****
The surface tension of pure liquid water in contact with its vapor has been
given by IAPWS[30] as
          &#x03B3;  w   = 235.8   (  1 &#x2212;   T  T  C      )   1.256
      [  1 &#x2212; 0.625  (  1 &#x2212;   T  T  C      )   ]  &#xA0;  mN/m  ,
      {\displaystyle \gamma _{\text{w}}=235.8\left(1-{\frac {T}{T_{\text
      {C}}}}\right)^{1.256}\left[1-0.625\left(1-{\frac {T}{T_{\text
      {C}}}}\right)\right]~{\text{mN/m}},}  [{\displaystyle \gamma _{\text
      {w}}=235.8\left(1-{\frac {T}{T_{\text{C}}}}\right)^{1.256}\left[1-
      0.625\left(1-{\frac {T}{T_{\text{C}}}}\right)\right]~{\text{mN/m}},}]
where both T and the critical temperature TC = 647.096¬†K are expressed in
kelvins. The region of validity the entire vapor√¢¬Ä¬ìliquid saturation curve,
from the triple point (0.01¬†√Ç¬∞C) to the critical point. It also provides
reasonable results when extrapolated to metastable (supercooled) conditions,
down to at least √¢¬à¬í25¬†√Ç¬∞C. This formulation was originally adopted by IAPWS in
1976 and was adjusted in 1994 to conform to the International Temperature Scale
of 1990.
The uncertainty of this formulation is given over the full range of temperature
by IAPWS.[30] For temperatures below 100¬†√Ç¬∞C, the uncertainty is √Ç¬±0.5%.
**** Surface tension of seawater[edit] ****
Nayar et al.[31] published reference data for the surface tension of seawater
over the salinity range of 20 √¢¬â¬§ S √¢¬â¬§ 131 g/kg and a temperature range of 1
√¢¬â¬§ t √¢¬â¬§ 92 √Ç¬∞C at atmospheric pressure. The uncertainty of the measurements
varied from 0.18 to 0.37¬†mN/m with the average uncertainty being 0.22¬†mN/m.
This data is correlated by the following equation
          &#x03B3;   s w    =  &#x03B3;   w     (  1 + 3.766 &#x00D7;  10
      &#x2212; 4   S + 2.347 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 6   S t  )
      {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {sw} }=\gamma _{\mathrm {w} }\left
      (1+3.766\times 10^{-4}S+2.347\times 10^{-6}St\right)}  [{\displaystyle
      \gamma _{\mathrm {sw} }=\gamma _{\mathrm {w} }\left(1+3.766\times 10^{-
      4}S+2.347\times 10^{-6}St\right)}]
where √é¬≥sw is the surface tension of seawater in mN/m, √é¬≥w is the surface
tension of water in mN/m, S is the reference salinity[32] in g/kg, and t is
temperature in degrees Celsius. The average absolute percentage deviation
between measurements and the correlation was 0.19% while the maximum deviation
is 0.60%.
The range of temperature and salinity encompasses both the oceanographic range
and the range of conditions encountered in thermal desalination technologies.

***** Gallery of effects[edit] *****
    * Breakup of a moving sheet of water bouncing off of a spoon.
    * Photo of flowing water adhering to a hand. Surface tension creates the
      sheet of water between the flow and the hand.
    * A soap bubble balances surface tension forces against internal pneumatic
      pressure.
    * Surface tension prevents a coin from sinking: the coin is indisputably
      denser than water, so it must be displacing a volume greater than its own
      for buoyancy to balance mass.
    * A daisy. The entirety of the flower lies below the level of the
      (undisturbed) free surface. The water rises smoothly around its edge.
      Surface tension prevents water filling the air between the petals and
      possibly submerging the flower.
    * A metal paper clip floats on water. Several can usually be carefully
      added without overflow of water.
    * An aluminium coin floats on the surface of the water at 10¬†√Ç¬∞C. Any extra
      weight would drop the coin to the bottom.
    * A metal paperclip floating on water. A grille in front of the light has
      created the 'contour lines' which show the deformation in the water
      surface caused by the metal paper clip.
