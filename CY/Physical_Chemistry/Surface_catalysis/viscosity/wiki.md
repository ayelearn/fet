The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a
given rate. For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of "thickness":
for example, syrup has a higher viscosity than water.[1]
Viscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the frictional_force that arises
between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance,
when a fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's
axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some stress
(such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to
sustain the flow through the tube. This is because a force is required to
overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative
motion: the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity.
A fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid
fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at very_low_temperatures in superfluids.
Otherwise, the second_law_of_thermodynamics requires all fluids to have
positive viscosity;[2][3] such fluids are technically said to be viscous or
viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as pitch, may appear to be a solid.

***** Etymology *****
The word "viscosity" is derived from the Latin "viscum", meaning mistletoe and
also a viscous glue made from mistletoe berries.[4]
***** Definition *****
**** Simple definition ****
Illustration of a planar Couette flow. Since the shearing flow is opposed by
friction between adjacent layers of fluid (which are in relative motion), a
force is required to sustain the motion of the upper plate. The relative
strength of this force is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.
In a general parallel flow, the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of
the velocity.
In materials_science and engineering, one is often interested in understanding
the forces, or stresses, involved in the deformation of a material. For
instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by
Hooke's_law, which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional
to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to
the deformation of a material from some rest state are called elastic stresses.
In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the rate_of
change_of_the_deformation over time. These are called viscous stresses. For
instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the
fluid do not depend on the distance the fluid has been sheared; rather, they
depend on how quickly the shearing occurs.
Viscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a
material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it
applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple
shearing flow, such as a planar Couette_flow.
In the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates,
one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed     u   {\displaystyle
u}  [u] (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low
enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move
parallel to it, and their speed varies from     0   {\displaystyle 0}  [
{\displaystyle 0}] at the bottom to     u   {\displaystyle u}  [u] at the top.
[5] Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction
between them gives rise to a force resisting their relative motion. In
particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction
opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An
external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at
constant speed.
In many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the
bottom to     u   {\displaystyle u}  [u] at the top. Moreover, the magnitude
F   {\displaystyle F}  [F] of the force acting on the top plate is found to be
proportional to the speed     u   {\displaystyle u}  [u] and the area     A
{\displaystyle A}  [A] of each plate, and inversely proportional to their
separation     y   {\displaystyle y}  [y]:
         F = &#x03BC; A   u y   .   {\displaystyle F=\mu A{\frac {u}{y}}.}
      [F=\mu A{\frac {u}{y}}.]
The proportionality factor     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] is the
viscosity of the fluid, with units of      Pa  &#x22C5;  s    {\displaystyle
{\text{Pa}}\cdot {\text{s}}}  [{\displaystyle {\text{Pa}}\cdot {\text{s}}}]
(pascal-second). The ratio     u  /  y   {\displaystyle u/y}  [u/y] is called
the rate of shear deformation or shear_velocity, and is the derivative of the
fluid speed in the direction perpendicular to the plates (see illustrations to
the right). If the velocity does not vary linearly with     y   {\displaystyle
y}  [y], then the appropriate generalization is
         &#x03C4; = &#x03BC;    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; y    ,   {\displaystyle
      \tau =\mu {\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}},}  [\tau =\mu {\frac {\partial
      u}{\partial y}},]
where     &#x03C4; = F  /  A   {\displaystyle \tau =F/A}  [{\displaystyle \tau
=F/A}], and     &#x2202; u  /  &#x2202; y   {\displaystyle \partial u/\partial
y}  [{\displaystyle \partial u/\partial y}] is the local shear velocity. This
expression is referred to as Newton's law of viscosity. In shearing flows with
planar symmetry, it is what defines     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu
]. It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below),
which can be expressed in coordinate-free form.
Use of the Greek_letter_mu (    &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ]) for
the viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as
physicists.[6][7][8] However, the Greek_letter_eta (    &#x03B7;
{\displaystyle \eta }  [\eta ]) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the
IUPAC.[9] The viscosity     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] is
sometimes also referred to as the shear viscosity. However, at least one author
discourages the use of this terminology, noting that     &#x03BC;
{\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] can appear in nonshearing flows in addition to
shearing flows.[10]
**** General definition ****
See also: Viscous_stress_tensor and Volume_viscosity
In very general terms, the viscous stresses in a fluid are defined as those
resulting from the relative velocity of different fluid particles. As such, the
viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the
velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous
stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity.[11] (For
Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates,
the general relationship can then be written as
          &#x03C4;  i j   =  &#x2211;  k    &#x2211;  l    &#x03BC;  i j k l
      &#x2202;  v  k     &#x2202;  r  l      ,   {\displaystyle \tau _{ij}=\sum
      _{k}\sum _{l}\mu _{ijkl}{\frac {\partial v_{k}}{\partial r_{l}}},}  [
      {\displaystyle \tau _{ij}=\sum _{k}\sum _{l}\mu _{ijkl}{\frac {\partial
      v_{k}}{\partial r_{l}}},}]
where      &#x03BC;  i j k l     {\displaystyle \mu _{ijkl}}  [{\displaystyle
\mu _{ijkl}}] is a viscosity tensor that maps the strain rate tensor
&#x2202;  v  k    /  &#x2202;  r  l     {\displaystyle \partial v_{k}/\partial
r_{l}}  [{\displaystyle \partial v_{k}/\partial r_{l}}] onto the viscous stress
tensor      &#x03C4;  i j     {\displaystyle \tau _{ij}}  [\tau _{ij}].[12]
Since the indices in this expression can vary from 1 to 3, there are 81
"viscosity coefficients"      &#x03BC;  i j k l     {\displaystyle \mu _{ijkl}}
[{\displaystyle \mu _{ijkl}}] in total. However, due to spatial symmetries
these coefficients are not all independent. For instance, for isotropic
Newtonian fluids, the 81 coefficients can be reduced to 2 independent
parameters. The most usual decomposition yields the standard (scalar) viscosity
&#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] and the bulk_viscosity     &#x03BA;
{\displaystyle \kappa }  [\kappa ]:
          &#x03C4;  = &#x03BC;  [  &#x2207;  v  + ( &#x2207;  v   )  &#x2020;
      ]  &#x2212;  (    2 3   &#x03BC; &#x2212; &#x03BA;  )  ( &#x2207;
      &#x22C5;  v  )  &#x03B4;  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {\tau } =\mu \left
      [\nabla \mathbf {v} +(\nabla \mathbf {v} )^{\dagger }\right]-\left({\frac
      {2}{3}}\mu -\kappa \right)(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} )\mathbf {\delta } ,}
      [{\displaystyle \mathbf {\tau } =\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {v} +(\nabla
      \mathbf {v} )^{\dagger }\right]-\left({\frac {2}{3}}\mu -\kappa \right)
      (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} )\mathbf {\delta } ,}]
where      &#x03B4;    {\displaystyle \mathbf {\delta } }  [{\displaystyle
\mathbf {\delta } }] is the unit tensor, and the dagger     &#x2020;
{\displaystyle \dagger }  [\dagger ] denotes the transpose.[13][14] This
equation can be thought of as a generalized form of Newton's law of viscosity.
The bulk viscosity (also called volume viscosity) expresses a type of internal
friction that resists the shearless compression or expansion of a fluid.
Knowledge of     &#x03BA;   {\displaystyle \kappa }  [\kappa ] is frequently
not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid
satisfies     &#x2207; &#x22C5;  v  = 0   {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf
{v} =0}  [\nabla \cdot {\mathbf  {v}}=0] and so the term containing
&#x03BA;   {\displaystyle \kappa }  [\kappa ] drops out. Moreover,     &#x03BA;
{\displaystyle \kappa }  [\kappa ] is often assumed to be negligible for gases
since it is     0   {\displaystyle 0}  [{\displaystyle 0}] in a monoatomic
ideal_gas.[13] One situation in which     &#x03BA;   {\displaystyle \kappa }
[\kappa ] can be important is the calculation of energy loss in sound and shock
waves, described by Stokes'_law_of_sound_attenuation, since these phenomena
involve rapid expansions and compressions.
It is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of
nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any
given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity,
must be established using separate means.
**** Dynamic and kinematic viscosity ****
In fluid dynamics, it is common to work in terms of the kinematic viscosity
(also called "momentum diffusivity"), defined as the ratio of the viscosity Î¼
to the density of the fluid Ï. It is usually denoted by the Greek_letter_nu
(Î½) and has units      ( l e n g t h  )  2    /  t i m e    {\displaystyle
\mathrm {(length)^{2}/time} }  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {(length)^{2}/time} }]:
         &#x03BD; =   &#x03BC; &#x03C1;     {\displaystyle \nu ={\frac {\mu }
      {\rho }}}  [\nu ={\frac {\mu }{\rho }}].
Consistent with this nomenclature, the viscosity     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle
\mu }  [\mu ] is frequently called the dynamic viscosity or absolute viscosity,
and has units force Ã time/area.
***** Momentum transport *****
See also: Transport_phenomena
Transport theory provides an alternate interpretation of viscosity in terms of
momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes
momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal_conductivity characterizes
heat transport, and (mass) diffusivity characterizes mass transport.[15] To see
this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity,     &#x03C4; = &#x03BC;
( &#x2202; u  /  &#x2202; y )   {\displaystyle \tau =\mu (\partial u/\partial
y)}  [{\displaystyle \tau =\mu (\partial u/\partial y)}], the shear stress
&#x03C4;   {\displaystyle \tau }  [\tau ] has units equivalent to a momentum
flux, i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus,     &#x03C4;
{\displaystyle \tau }  [\tau ] can be interpreted as specifying the flow of
momentum in the     y   {\displaystyle y}  [y] direction from one fluid layer
to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a
velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is
determined by the viscosity.
The analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat
flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density
to low density, momentumflows from high velocity to low velocity. These
behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called constitutive
relations, whose one-dimensional forms are given here:
              J     = &#x2212; D    &#x2202; &#x03C1;   &#x2202; x
      (Fick's law of diffusion)       q     = &#x2212;  k  t      &#x2202; T
      &#x2202; x         (Fourier's law of heat conduction)      &#x03C4;    =
      &#x03BC;    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; y       (Newton's law of viscosity)
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {J} &=-D{\frac {\partial \rho }
      {\partial x}}\qquad \;\;\;\,{\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)}}\\\mathbf
      {q} &=-k_{t}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial x}}\qquad \;\;\,{\text{
      (Fourier's law of heat conduction)}}\\\tau &=\mu {\frac {\partial u}
      {\partial y}}\qquad \qquad {\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}}\\\end
      {aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {J} &=-D{\frac
      {\partial \rho }{\partial x}}\qquad \;\;\;\,{\text{(Fick's law of
      diffusion)}}\\\mathbf {q} &=-k_{t}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial x}}\qquad
      \;\;\,{\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)}}\\\tau &=\mu {\frac
      {\partial u}{\partial y}}\qquad \qquad {\text{(Newton's law of
      viscosity)}}\\\end{aligned}}}]
where     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is the density,      J
{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} }  [\mathbf {J} ] and      q    {\displaystyle
\mathbf {q} }  [\mathbf {q} ] are the mass and heat fluxes, and     D
{\displaystyle D}  [D] and      k  t     {\displaystyle k_{t}}  [k_{t}] are the
mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity.[16]
The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most
relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among
the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in
interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and
complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic
timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and
hydrodynamics.
***** Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids *****
Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials.
Newton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a
constitutive_equation (like Hooke's_law, Fick's_law, and Ohm's_law) which
serves to define the viscosity     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ]. Its
form is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids,
&#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] is independent of strain rate. Such
fluids are called Newtonian. Gases, water, and many common liquids can be
considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are
many non-Newtonian_fluids that significantly deviate from this behavior. For
example:
    * Shear-thickening liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of
      shear strain.
    * Shear-thinning liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear
      strain.
    * Thixotropic liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken,
      agitated, or otherwise stressed.
    * Rheopectic (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when
      shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.
    * Bingham_plastics that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a
      viscous fluid at high stresses.
The Trouton ratio or Trouton's ratio is the ratio of extensional_viscosity to
shear_viscosity.[17] For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3.[18]
Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as
thixotropic.[19]
Even for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition
and temperature. For gases and other compressible_fluids, it depends on
temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids
may depend on other factors. A magnetorheological_fluid, for example, becomes
thicker when subjected to a magnetic_field, possibly to the point of behaving
like a solid.
***** In solids *****
The viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the
elastic forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or
extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the
amount of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the rate of
deformation over time. (For this reason, Maxwell used the term fugitive
elasticity for fluid viscosity.)
However, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids
when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many "solids" (even granite) will
flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress.[20]
Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity
(reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that
is, being viscoelastic.
Indeed, some authors have claimed that amorphous_solids, such as glass and many
polymers, are actually liquids with a very high viscosity (greater than
1012 PaÂ·s). [21] However, other authors dispute this hypothesis, claiming
instead that there is some threshold for the stress, below which most solids
will not flow at all,[22] and that alleged instances of glass flow in window
panes of old buildings are due to the crude manufacturing process of older eras
rather than to the viscosity of glass.[23]
Viscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The
extensional_viscosity is a linear_combination of the shear and bulk viscosities
that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is
widely used for characterizing polymers.
In geology, earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three
orders_of_magnitude greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called
rheids.[24]
***** Measurement *****
Main article: Viscometer
Viscosity is measured with various types of viscometers and rheometers. A
rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of
viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is
the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential
to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants,
whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5 Â°C.
For some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates
(Newtonian_fluids). The fluids without a constant viscosity (non-Newtonian
fluids) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a
variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.
One of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the
glass capillary viscometer.
In coating industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the efflux
time is measured. There are several sorts of cup â such as the Zahn_cup and
the Ford_viscosity_cup â with the usage of each type varying mainly according
to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities
(centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.[25]
Also used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order
to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which
are unique to Stormer viscometers.
Vibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or
vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this
method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a
specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid,
energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured
and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater
loss of energy.[citation_needed]
Extensional viscosity can be measured with various rheometers that apply
extensional_stress.
Volume_viscosity can be measured with an acoustic_rheometer.
Apparent_viscosity is a calculation derived from tests performed on drilling
fluid used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help
engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the
specifications required.
***** Units *****
The SI unit of dynamic viscosity is the pascal-second (PaÂ·s), or equivalently
kilogram per meter per second (kgÂ·mâ1Â·sâ1). The CGS unit is called the
poise[26] (P), named after Jean_LÃ©onard_Marie_Poiseuille. It is commonly
expressed, particularly in ASTM standards, as centipoise (cP) since the latter
is equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPaÂ·s).
The SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m2/s), whereas
the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the stokes (St), named after Sir George
Gabriel_Stokes.[27] In U.S. usage, stoke is sometimes used as the singular
form. The submultiple centistokes (cSt) is often used instead.
The reciprocal of viscosity is fluidity, usually symbolized by     &#x03D5; = 1
/  &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \phi =1/\mu }  [{\displaystyle \phi =1/\mu }] or
F = 1  /  &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle F=1/\mu }  [{\displaystyle F=1/\mu }],
depending on the convention used, measured in reciprocal poise (Pâ1, or
cmÂ·sÂ·gâ1), sometimes called the rhe. Fluidity is seldom used in engineering
practice.
Nonstandard units include the reyn, a British unit of dynamic viscosity.
[citation_needed] In the automotive industry the viscosity_index is used to
describe the change of viscosity with temperature.
At one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by
means of the Saybolt_viscometer, and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of
Saybolt_universal_seconds (SUS).[28] Other abbreviations such as SSU (Saybolt
seconds universal) or SUV (Saybolt universal viscosity) are sometimes used.
Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the
arithmetic and the reference table provided in ASTM D 2161.[29]
***** Molecular origins *****
In general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules
constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions
for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the
GreenâKubo_relations for the linear shear viscosity or the transient time
correlation function expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1985.[30]
Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense
fluid using these relations currently requires the use of molecular_dynamics
computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a
dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and
interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity.
More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-
graining the equations_of_motion of the gas molecules. An example of such a
treatment is ChapmanâEnskog_theory, which derives expressions for the
viscosity of a dilute gas from the Boltzmann_equation.[31]
Momentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular
collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close
together.[15] Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically
much larger than those of gases.

      Elementary calculation of viscosity for a dilute gas
      Consider a dilute gas moving parallel to the     x   {\displaystyle x}
      [x]-axis with velocity     u ( y )   {\displaystyle u(y)}  [u(y)] that
      depends only on the     y   {\displaystyle y}  [y] coordinate. To
      simplify the discussion, the gas is assumed to have uniform temperature
      and density.
      Under these assumptions, the     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x] velocity of a
      molecule passing through     y = 0   {\displaystyle y=0}  [y=0] is equal
      to whatever velocity that molecule had when its mean free path
      &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ] began. Because
      &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ] is typically small
      compared with macroscopic scales, the average     x   {\displaystyle x}
      [x] velocity of such a molecule has the form
               u ( 0 ) &#x00B1; &#x03B1; &#x03BB;    d u   d y    ( 0 )
            {\displaystyle u(0)\pm \alpha \lambda {\frac {du}{dy}}(0)}  [
            {\displaystyle u(0)\pm \alpha \lambda {\frac {du}{dy}}(0)}],
      where     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is a numerical
      constant on the order of     1   {\displaystyle 1}  [1]. (Some authors
      estimate     &#x03B1; = 2  /  3   {\displaystyle \alpha =2/3}  [
      {\displaystyle \alpha =2/3}];[15][32] on the other hand, a more careful
      calculation for rigid elastic spheres gives     &#x03B1; &#x2243; 0.998
      {\displaystyle \alpha \simeq 0.998}  [{\displaystyle \alpha \simeq
      0.998}].) Now, because half the molecules on either side are moving
      towards     y = 0   {\displaystyle y=0}  [y=0], and doing so on average
      with half the average_moleculer_speed     ( 8  k  B   T  /  &#x03C0; m  )
      1  /  2     {\displaystyle (8k_{\text{B}}T/\pi m)^{1/2}}  [{\displaystyle
      (8k_{\text{B}}T/\pi m)^{1/2}}], the momentum flux from either side is
                 1 4   &#x03C1; &#x22C5;     8  k  B   T   &#x03C0; m
            &#x22C5;  (  u ( 0 ) &#x00B1; &#x03B1; &#x03BB;    d u   d y    ( 0
            )  )  .   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}\rho \cdot {\sqrt {\frac
            {8k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}}\cdot \left(u(0)\pm \alpha \lambda {\frac
            {du}{dy}}(0)\right).}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}\rho \cdot
            {\sqrt {\frac {8k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}}\cdot \left(u(0)\pm \alpha
            \lambda {\frac {du}{dy}}(0)\right).}]
      The net momentum flux at     y = 0   {\displaystyle y=0}  [y=0] is the
      difference of the two:
               &#x2212;   1 2   &#x03C1; &#x22C5;     8  k  B   T   &#x03C0; m
            &#x22C5; &#x03B1; &#x03BB;    d u   d y    ( 0 ) .   {\displaystyle
            -{\frac {1}{2}}\rho \cdot {\sqrt {\frac {8k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi
            m}}}\cdot \alpha \lambda {\frac {du}{dy}}(0).}  [{\displaystyle -
            {\frac {1}{2}}\rho \cdot {\sqrt {\frac {8k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi
            m}}}\cdot \alpha \lambda {\frac {du}{dy}}(0).}]
      According to the definition of viscosity, this momentum flux should be
      equal to     &#x2212; &#x03BC;    d u   d y    ( 0 )   {\displaystyle -
      \mu {\frac {du}{dy}}(0)}  [{\displaystyle -\mu {\frac {du}{dy}}(0)}],
      which leads to
               &#x03BC; = &#x03B1; &#x03C1; &#x03BB;     2  k  B   T   &#x03C0;
            m     .   {\displaystyle \mu =\alpha \rho \lambda {\sqrt {\frac
            {2k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}}.}  [{\displaystyle \mu =\alpha \rho
            \lambda {\sqrt {\frac {2k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}}.}]
Viscosity in gases arises principally from the molecular_diffusion that
transports momentum between layers of flow. An elementary calculation for a
dilute gas at temperature     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] and density
&#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] gives
         &#x03BC; = &#x03B1; &#x03C1; &#x03BB;     2  k  B   T   &#x03C0; m
      ,   {\displaystyle \mu =\alpha \rho \lambda {\sqrt {\frac {2k_{\text
      {B}}T}{\pi m}}},}  [{\displaystyle \mu =\alpha \rho \lambda {\sqrt {\frac
      {2k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}},}]
where      k  B     {\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}}  [k_{\text{B}}] is the
Boltzmann_constant,     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] the molecular mass, and
&#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] a numerical constant on the order
of     1   {\displaystyle 1}  [1]. The quantity     &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle
\lambda }  [\lambda ], the mean_free_path, measures the average distance a
molecule travels between collisions. Even without a priori knowledge of
&#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ], this expression has interesting
implications. In particular, since     &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }
[\lambda ] is typically inversely proportional to density and increases with
temperature,     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] itself should increase
with temperature and be independent of density at fixed temperature. In fact,
both of these predictions persist in more sophisticated treatments, and
accurately describe experimental observations. Note that this behavior runs
counter to common intuition regarding liquids, for which viscosity typically
decreases with temperature.[15][32]
For rigid elastic spheres of diameter     &#x03C3;   {\displaystyle \sigma }
[\sigma ],     &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ] can be computed,
giving
         &#x03BC; =   &#x03B1;  &#x03C0;  3  /  2         k  B   m T   &#x03C3;
      2     .   {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {\alpha }{\pi ^{3/2}}}{\frac {\sqrt
      {k_{\text{B}}mT}}{\sigma ^{2}}}.}  [{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {\alpha }
      {\pi ^{3/2}}}{\frac {\sqrt {k_{\text{B}}mT}}{\sigma ^{2}}}.}]
In this case     &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ] is independent
of temperature, so     &#x03BC; &#x221D;  T  1  /  2     {\displaystyle \mu
\propto T^{1/2}}  [{\displaystyle \mu \propto T^{1/2}}]. For more complicated
molecular models, however,     &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ]
depends on temperature in a non-trivial way, and simple kinetic arguments as
used here are inadequate. More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path
becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits
the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases.[33]
*** ChapmanâEnskog theory ***
Main article: ChapmanâEnskog_theory
A technique developed by Sydney_Chapman and David_Enskog in the early 1900s
allows a more refined calculation of     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu
].[31] It is based on the Boltzmann_equation, which provides a systematic
statistical description of a dilute gas in terms of intermolecular
interactions.[34] As such, their technique allows accurate calculation of
&#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] for more realistic molecular models,
such as those incorporating intermolecular attraction rather than just hard-
core repulsion.
It turns out that a more realistic modeling of interactions is essential for
accurate prediction of the temperature dependence of     &#x03BC;
{\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ], which experiments show increases more rapidly
than the      T  1  /  2     {\displaystyle T^{1/2}}  [T^{1/2}] trend predicted
for rigid elastic spheres.[15] Indeed, the ChapmanâEnskog analysis shows that
the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in
various molecular models. A simple example is the Sutherland model,[35] which
describes rigid elastic spheres with weak mutual attraction. In such a case,
the attractive force can be treated perturbatively, which leads to a
particularly simple expression for     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ]:
         &#x03BC; =   5  16  &#x03C3;  2        (     k  B   m T  &#x03C0;   )
      1  /  2     (  1 +   S T    )   &#x2212; 1   ,   {\displaystyle \mu =
      {\frac {5}{16\sigma ^{2}}}\left({\frac {k_{\text{B}}mT}{\pi }}\right)^{1/
      2}\left(1+{\frac {S}{T}}\right)^{-1},}  [{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {5}
      {16\sigma ^{2}}}\left({\frac {k_{\text{B}}mT}{\pi }}\right)^{1/2}\left(1+
      {\frac {S}{T}}\right)^{-1},}]
where     S   {\displaystyle S}  [S] is independent of temperature, being
determined only by the parameters of the intermolecular attraction. To connect
with experiment, it is convenient to rewrite as
         &#x03BC; =  &#x03BC;  0     (   T  T  0     )   3  /  2       T  0   +
      S   T + S    ,   {\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{0}\left({\frac {T}{T_
      {0}}}\right)^{3/2}{\frac {T_{0}+S}{T+S}},}  [{\displaystyle \mu =\mu _
      {0}\left({\frac {T}{T_{0}}}\right)^{3/2}{\frac {T_{0}+S}{T+S}},}]
where      &#x03BC;  0     {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}  [\mu _{0}] is the
viscosity at temperature      T  0     {\displaystyle T_{0}}  [T_{0}]. If
&#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] is known from experiments at     T =  T
0     {\displaystyle T=T_{0}}  [T=T_{0}] and at least one other temperature,
then     S   {\displaystyle S}  [S] can be calculated. It turns out that
expressions for     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] obtained in this
way are accurate for a number of gases over a sizable range of temperatures. On
the other hand, Chapman and Cowling[31] argue that this success does not imply
that molecules actually interact according to the Sutherland model. Rather,
they interpret the prediction for     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ]
as a simple interpolation which is valid for some gases over fixed ranges of
temperature, but otherwise does not provide a picture of intermolecular
interactions which is fundamentally correct and general. Slightly more
sophisticated models, such as the Lennard-Jones_potential, may provide a better
picture, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature. In
some systems the assumption of spherical symmetry must be abandoned as well, as
is the case for vapors with highly polar_molecules like H2O.[36][37]
*** Bulk viscosity ***
In the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscosity arises in gases
whenever there are non-negligible relaxational timescales governing the
exchange of energy between the translational energy of molecules and their
internal energy, e.g. rotational and vibrational. As such, the bulk viscosity
is     0   {\displaystyle 0}  [{\displaystyle 0}] for a monatomic ideal gas, in
which the internal energy of molecules in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas
like carbon_dioxide, whose molecules possess both rotational and vibrational
energy.[38][39]

Experiment showing the behavior of a viscous fluid with blue dye for visibility
In contrast with gases, there is no simple yet accurate picture for the
molecular origins of viscosity in liquids.
At the simplest level of description, the relative motion of adjacent layers in
a liquid is opposed primarily by attractive molecular forces acting across the
layer boundary. In this picture, one (correctly) expects viscosity to decrease
with increasing temperature. This is because increasing temperature increases
the random thermal motion of the molecules, which makes it easier for them to
overcome their attractive interactions.[40]
Building on this visualization, a simple theory can be constructed in analogy
with the discrete structure of a solid: groups of molecules in a liquid are
visualized as forming "cages" which surround and enclose single molecules.[41]
These cages can be occupied or unoccupied, and stronger molecular attraction
corresponds to stronger cages. Due to random thermal motion, a molecule "hops"
between cages at a rate which varies inversely with the strength of molecular
attractions. In equilibrium these "hops" are not biased in any direction. On
the other hand, in order for two adjacent layers to move relative to each
other, the "hops" must be biased in the direction of the relative motion. The
force required to sustain this directed motion can be estimated for a given
shear rate, leading to
         &#x03BC; &#x2248;     N  A   h  V   exp &#x2061;  (  3.8
      T  b   T    )  ,   {\displaystyle \mu \approx {\frac {N_{A}h}      
      {V}}\operatorname {exp} \left(3.8{\frac {T_{b}}{T}}\right),}  [      (1)
      {\displaystyle \mu \approx {\frac {N_{A}h}{V}}\operatorname
      {exp} \left(3.8{\frac {T_{b}}{T}}\right),}]
where      N  A     {\displaystyle N_{A}}  [N_{A}] is the Avogadro_constant,
h   {\displaystyle h}  [h] is the Planck_constant,     V   {\displaystyle V}
[V] is the volume of a mole of liquid, and      T  b     {\displaystyle T_{b}}
[T_{b}] is the normal_boiling_point. This result has the same form as the
widespread and accurate empirical relation
         &#x03BC; = A  e   B T    ,   {\displaystyle \mu =Ae^{\frac     (2)
      {B}{T}},}  [{\displaystyle \mu =Ae^{\frac {B}{T}},}]              
where     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A] and     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B] are
constants fit from data.[41][42] On the other hand, several authors express
caution with respect to this model. Errors as large as 30% can be encountered
using equation (1), compared with fitting equation (2) to experimental data.
[41] More fundamentally, the physical assumptions underlying equation (1) have
been criticized.[43] It has also been argued that the exponential dependence in
equation (1) does not necessarily describe experimental observations more
accurately than simpler, non-exponential expressions.[44][45]
In light of these shortcomings, the development of a less ad-hoc model is a
matter of practical interest. Foregoing simplicity in favor of precision, it is
possible to write rigorous expressions for viscosity starting from the
fundamental equations of motion for molecules. A classic example of this
approach is Irving-Kirkwood theory.[46] On the other hand, such expressions are
given as averages over multiparticle correlation_functions and are therefore
difficult to apply in practice.
In general, empirically derived expressions (based on existing viscosity
measurements) appear to be the only consistently reliable means of calculating
viscosity in liquids.[47]
**** Mixtures and blends ****
See also: Viscosity_models_for_mixtures
*** Gaseous mixtures ***
The same molecular-kinetic picture of a single component gas can also be
applied to a gaseous mixture. For instance, in the Chapman-Enskog approach the
viscosity      &#x03BC;  mix     {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{mix}}}  [
{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{mix}}}] of a binary mixture of gases can be written
in terms of the individual component viscosities      &#x03BC;  1 , 2
{\displaystyle \mu _{1,2}}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{1,2}}], their respective
volume fractions, and the intermolecular interactions.[48] As for the single-
component gas, the dependence of      &#x03BC;  mix     {\displaystyle \mu _
{\text{mix}}}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{mix}}}] on the parameters of the
intermolecular interactions enters through various collisional integrals which
may not be expressible in terms of elementary functions. To obtain usable
expressions for      &#x03BC;  mix     {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{mix}}}  [
{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{mix}}}] which reasonably match experimental data,
the collisional integrals typically must be evaluated using some combination of
analytic calculation and empirical fitting. An example of such a procedure is
the Sutherland approach for the single-component gas, discussed above.
*** Blends of liquids ***
As for pure liquids, the viscosity of a blend of liquids is difficult to
predict from molecular principles. One method is to extend the molecular "cage"
theory presented above for a pure liquid. This can be done with varying levels
of sophistication. One useful expression resulting from such an analysis is the
Lederer-Roegiers equation for a binary mixture:
          &#x03BC;  blend   =    x  1     x  1   + &#x03B1;  x  2      ln
      &#x2061;  &#x03BC;  1   +    &#x03B1;  x  2      x  1   + &#x03B1;  x  2
      ln &#x2061;  &#x03BC;  2   ,   {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{blend}}={\frac
      {x_{1}}{x_{1}+\alpha x_{2}}}\ln \mu _{1}+{\frac {\alpha x_{2}}{x_
      {1}+\alpha x_{2}}}\ln \mu _{2},}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{blend}}=
      {\frac {x_{1}}{x_{1}+\alpha x_{2}}}\ln \mu _{1}+{\frac {\alpha x_{2}}{x_
      {1}+\alpha x_{2}}}\ln \mu _{2},}]
where     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is an empirical
parameter, and      x  1 , 2     {\displaystyle x_{1,2}}  [{\displaystyle x_
{1,2}}] and      &#x03BC;  1 , 2     {\displaystyle \mu _{1,2}}  [
{\displaystyle \mu _{1,2}}] are the respective mole_fractions and viscosities
of the component liquids.[49]
Since blending is an important process in the lubricating and oil industries, a
variety of empirical and propriety equations exist for predicting the viscosity
of a blend, besides those stemming directly from molecular theory.[49]
**** Solutions and suspensions ****
*** Aqeuous solutions ***
See also: DebyeâHÃ¼ckel_theory and List_of_viscosities_Â§ Aqueous_solutions
Depending on the solute and range of concentration, an aqueous electrolyte
solution can have either a larger or smaller viscosity compared with pure water
at the same temperature and pressure. For instance, a 20% saline (sodium
chloride) solution has viscosity over 1.5 times that of pure water, whereas a
20% potassium_iodide solution has viscosity about 0.91 times that of pure
water.
An idealized model of dilute electrolytic solutions leads to the following
prediction for the viscosity      &#x03BC;  s     {\displaystyle \mu _{s}}
[\mu _{s}] of a solution:[50]
            &#x03BC;  s    &#x03BC;  0     = 1 + A   c   ,   {\displaystyle
      {\frac {\mu _{s}}{\mu _{0}}}=1+A{\sqrt {c}},}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {\mu _{s}}{\mu _{0}}}=1+A{\sqrt {c}},}]
where      &#x03BC;  0     {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}  [\mu _{0}] is the
viscosity of the solvent,     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] is the concentration,
and     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A] is a positive constant which depends on both
solvent and solute properties. However, this expression is only valid for very
dilute solutions, having     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] less than 0.1 mol/L.
[51] For higher concentrations, additional terms are necessary which account
for higher-order molecular correlations:
            &#x03BC;  s    &#x03BC;  0     = 1 + A   c   + B c + C  c  2
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\mu _{s}}{\mu _{0}}}=1+A{\sqrt {c}}+Bc+Cc^{2}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\mu _{s}}{\mu _{0}}}=1+A{\sqrt {c}}+Bc+Cc^{2}}]
where     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B] and     C   {\displaystyle C}  [C] are fit
from data. In particular, a negative value of     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B] is
able to account for the decrease in viscosity observed in some solutions.
Estimated values of these constants are shown below for sodium chloride and
potassium iodide at temperature 25 Â°C (mol = mole, L = liter).[50]

*** Suspensions ***
In a suspension of solid particles (e.g. micron-size spheres suspended in oil),
an effective viscosity      &#x03BC;  eff     {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}
[{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}] can be defined in terms of stress and
strain components which are averaged over a volume large compared with the
distance between the suspended particles, but small with respect to macroscopic
dimensions.[52] Such suspensions generally exhibit non-Newtonian behavior.
However, for dilute systems in steady flows, the behavior is Newtonian and
expressions for      &#x03BC;  eff     {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}  [
{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}] can be derived directly from the particle
dynamics. In a very dilute system, with volume fraction     &#x03D5; &#x2272;
0.02   {\displaystyle \phi \lesssim 0.02}  [{\displaystyle \phi \lesssim
0.02}], interactions between the suspended particles can be ignored. In such a
case one can explicitly calculate the flow field around each particle
independently, and combine the results to obtain      &#x03BC;  eff
{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}]. For
spheres, this results in the Einstein equation:
    &#x03BC;  eff   =  &#x03BC;  0    (  1 +   5 2   &#x03D5;  )  ,
{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+{\frac {5}{2}}\phi \right),}
[{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+{\frac {5}{2}}\phi \right),}]
where      &#x03BC;  0     {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}  [\mu _{0}] is the
viscosity of the suspending liquid. The linear dependence on     &#x03D5;
{\displaystyle \phi }  [\phi ] is a direct consequence of neglecting
interparticle interactions; in general, one will have:
    &#x03BC;  eff   =  &#x03BC;  0    (  1 + B &#x03D5;  )  ,   {\displaystyle
\mu _{\text{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+B\phi \right),}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{\text
{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+B\phi \right),}]
where the coefficient     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B] may depend on the particle
shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks).[53] Experimental determination of the
precise value of     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B] is difficult, however: even the
prediction     B = 5  /  2   {\displaystyle B=5/2}  [{\displaystyle B=5/2}] for
spheres has not been conclusively validated, with various experiments finding
values in the range     1.5 &#x2272; B &#x2272; 5   {\displaystyle 1.5\lesssim
B\lesssim 5}  [{\displaystyle 1.5\lesssim B\lesssim 5}]. This deficiency has
been attributed to difficulty in controlling experimental conditions.[54]
In denser suspensions,      &#x03BC;  eff     {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}
[{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}] acquires a nonlinear dependence on
&#x03D5;   {\displaystyle \phi }  [\phi ], which indicates the importance of
interparticle interactions. Various analytical and semi-empirical schemes exist
for capturing this regime. At the most basic level, a term quadratic in
&#x03D5;   {\displaystyle \phi }  [\phi ] is added to      &#x03BC;  eff
{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}}]:
    &#x03BC;  eff   =  &#x03BC;  0    (  1 + B &#x03D5; +  B  1    &#x03D5;  2
)  ,   {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+B\phi +B_{1}\phi ^
{2}\right),}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+B\phi +B_
{1}\phi ^{2}\right),}]
and the coefficient      B  1     {\displaystyle B_{1}}  [B_{1}] is fit from
experimental data or approximated from the microscopic theory. In general,
however, one should be cautious in applying such simple formulas since non-
Newtonian behavior appears in dense suspensions (    &#x03D5; &#x2273; 0.25
{\displaystyle \phi \gtrsim 0.25}  [{\displaystyle \phi \gtrsim 0.25}] for
spheres),[54] or in suspensions of elongated or flexible particles.[52]
There is a distinction between a suspension of solid particles, described
above, and an emulsion. The latter is a suspension of tiny droplets, which
themselves may exhibit internal circulation. The presence of internal
circulation can noticeably decrease the observed effective viscosity, and
different theoretical or semi-empirical models must be used.[55]
**** Amorphous materials ****
Common glass viscosity curves[56]
In the high and low temperature limits, viscous flow in amorphous_materials
(e.g. in glasses and melts)[57][58][59] has the Arrhenius_form:
         &#x03BC; = A  e   Q  R T     ,   {\displaystyle \mu =Ae^{\frac {Q}
      {RT}},}  [{\displaystyle \mu =Ae^{\frac {Q}{RT}},}]
where Q is a relevant activation_energy, given in terms of molecular
parameters; T is temperature; R is the molar gas_constant; and A is
approximately a constant. The activation energy Q takes a different value
depending on whether the high or low temperature limit is being considered: it
changes from a high value QH at low temperatures (in the glassy state) to a low
value QL at high temperatures (in the liquid state).
Common_logarithm of viscosity against temperature for B2O3, showing two regimes
For intermediate temperatures,     Q   {\displaystyle Q}  [Q] varies
nontrivially with temperature and the simple Arrhenius form fails. On the other
hand, the two-exponential equation
         &#x03BC; = A T exp &#x2061;  (   B  R T    )   [  1 + C exp &#x2061;
      (   D  R T    )   ]  ,   {\displaystyle \mu =AT\exp \left({\frac {B}
      {RT}}\right)\left[1+C\exp \left({\frac {D}{RT}}\right)\right],}  [
      {\displaystyle \mu =AT\exp \left({\frac {B}{RT}}\right)\left[1+C\exp
      \left({\frac {D}{RT}}\right)\right],}]
where     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A],     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B],     C
{\displaystyle C}  [C],     D   {\displaystyle D}  [D] are all constants,
provides a good fit to experimental data over the entire range of temperatures,
while at the same time reducing to the correct Arrhenius form in the low and
high temperature limits. Besides being a convenient fit to data, the expression
can also be derived from various theoretical models of amorphous materials at
the atomic level.[59]
**** Eddy viscosity ****
In the study of turbulence in fluids, a common practical strategy is to ignore
the small-scale vortices (or eddies) in the motion and to calculate a large-
scale motion with an effective viscosity, called the "eddy viscosity", which
characterizes the transport and dissipation of energy in the smaller-scale flow
(see large_eddy_simulation).[60][61] In contrast to the viscosity of the fluid
itself, which must be positive by the second_law_of_thermodynamics, the eddy
viscosity can be negative.[62][63]
***** Selected substances *****
Main article: List_of_viscosities
In the University of Queensland pitch_drop_experiment, pitch has been dripping
slowly through a funnel since 1927, at a rate of one drop roughly every decade.
In this way the viscosity of pitch has been determined to be approximately 230
billion (2.3Ã1011) times that of water.[64]
Observed values of viscosity vary over several orders of magnitude, even for
common substances. For instance, a 70% sucrose (sugar) solution has a viscosity
over 400 times that of water, and 26000 times that of air.[65] More
dramatically, pitch has been estimated to have a viscosity 230 billion times
that of water.[64]
**** Water ****
The dynamic_viscosity     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] of water is
about 0.89 mPaÂ·s at room temperature (25 Â°C). As a function of temperature,
the dynamic viscosity can be estimated using the semi-empirical relation:
         &#x03BC; = A &#x00D7;  10  B  /  ( T &#x2212; C )   ,   {\displaystyle
      \mu =A\times 10^{B/(T-C)},}  [{\displaystyle \mu =A\times 10^{B/(T-C)},}]
where A = 2.414Ã10â5 PaÂ·s, B = 247.8 K, and C = 140 K.[citation_needed]
Experimentally determined values of the dynamic viscosity at various
temperatures are given below.

70                0.40355
90                0.31417
**** Air ****
Under standard atmospheric conditions (25 Â°C and pressure of 1 bar), the
dynamic viscosity of air is 18.5 Î¼PaÂ·s, roughly 50 times smaller than the
viscosity of water at the same temperature. Except at very high pressure, the
viscosity of air depends mostly on the temperature.
