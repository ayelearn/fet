From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Food preservation prevents the growth of microorganisms (such as yeasts), or
other microorganisms (although some methods work by introducing benign bacteria
or fungi to the food), as well as slowing the oxidation of fats that cause
rancidity. Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual
deterioration, such as the enzymatic_browning reaction in apples after they are
cut during food preparation.
Many processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food
preservation method. Preserving fruit by turning it into jam, for example,
involves boiling (to reduce the fruitâs moisture content and to kill
bacteria, etc.), sugaring (to prevent their re-growth) and sealing within an
airtight jar (to prevent recontamination). Some traditional methods of
preserving food have been shown to have a lower energy_input and carbon
footprint, when compared to modern methods.[1]
Some methods of food preservation are known to create carcinogens. In 2015, the
International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer of the World_Health_Organization
classified processed meat, i.e. meat that has undergone salting, curing,
fermenting, and smoking, as "carcinogenic to humans".[2][3][4]
Maintaining or creating nutritional value, texture and flavor is an important
aspect of food preservation.

***** Traditional techniques *****
New techniques of food preservation became available to the home chef from the
dawn of agriculture until the Industrial_Revolution.
**** Curing ****
Bag of Prague powder#1, also known as "curing_salt" or "pink salt". It is
typically a combination of salt and sodium nitrite, with the pink color added
to distinguish it from ordinary salt.
Main article: Curing_(food_preservation)
The earliest form of curing was dehydration or drying, used as early as
12,000 BC. Smoking and salting techniques improve on the drying process and add
antimicrobial agents that aid in preservation. Smoke deposits a number of
pyrolysis products onto the food, including the phenols syringol, guaiacol and
catechol.[5] Salt accelerates the drying process using osmosis and also
inhibits the growth of several common strains of bacteria. More recently
nitrites have been used to cure meat, contributing a characteristic pink
colour.[6]
**** Cooling ****
Main article: Refrigeration
Cooling preserves food by slowing down the growth and reproduction of
microorganisms and the action of enzymes that causes the food to rot. The
introduction of commercial and domestic refrigerators drastically improved the
diets of many in the Western_world by allowing food such as fresh fruit, salads
and dairy products to be stored safely for longer periods, particularly during
warm weather.
Before the era of mechanical refrigeration, cooling for food storage occurred
in the forms of root_cellars and iceboxes. Rural people often did their own ice
cutting, whereas town and city dwellers often relied on the ice_trade. Today,
root cellaring remains popular among people who value various goals, including
local_food, heirloom_crops, traditional home cooking_techniques, family
farming, frugality, self-sufficiency, organic_farming, and others.
**** Freezing ****
Main article: Frozen_food
Freezing is also one of the most commonly used processes, both commercially and
domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods, including prepared
foods that would not have required freezing in their unprepared state. For
example, potato waffles are stored in the freezer, but potatoes themselves
require only a cool dark place to ensure many months' storage. Cold stores
provide large-volume, long-term storage for strategic food stocks held in case
of national emergency in many countries.
**** Boiling ****
Main article: Boiling
Boiling liquid food items can kill any existing microbes. Milk and water are
often boiled to kill any harmful microbes that may be present in them.
**** Heating ****
Heating to temperatures which are sufficient to kill microorganisms inside the
food is a method used with perpetual_stews. Milk is also boiled before storing
to kill many microorganisms.
**** Sugaring ****
See also: Sugaring
The earliest cultures have used sugar as a preservative, and it was commonplace
to store fruit in honey. Similar to pickled foods, sugar_cane was brought to
Europe through the trade routes. In northern climates without sufficient sun to
dry foods, preserves are made by heating the fruit with sugar.[7] "Sugar tends
to draw water from the microbes (plasmolysis). This process leaves the
microbial cells dehydrated, thus killing them. In this way, the food will
remain safe from microbial spoilage."[5] Sugar is used to preserve fruits,
either in an antimicrobial syrup with fruit such as apples, pears, peaches,
apricots, and plums, or in crystallized form where the preserved material is
cooked in sugar to the point of crystallization and the resultant product is
then stored dry. This method is used for the skins of citrus fruit (candied
peel), angelica, and ginger. Also, sugaring can be used in the production of
jam and jelly.
**** Pickling ****
Main article: Pickling
Pickling is a method of preserving food in an edible, antimicrobial liquid.
Pickling can be broadly classified into two categories: chemical pickling and
fermentation pickling.
In chemical pickling, the food is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or
kills bacteria and other microorganisms. Typical pickling agents include brine
(high in salt), vinegar, alcohol, and vegetable_oil. Many chemical pickling
processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved
becomes saturated with the pickling agent. Common chemically pickled foods
include cucumbers, peppers, corned_beef, herring, and eggs, as well as mixed
vegetables such as piccalilli.
In fermentation pickling, bacteria in the liquid produce organic_acids as
preservation agents, typically by a process that produces lactic_acid through
the presence of lactobacillales. Fermented pickles include sauerkraut,
nukazuke, kimchi, and surstrÃ¶mming.
**** Lye ****
Main article: Sodium_hydroxide_Â§ Food_preparation
Sodium_hydroxide (lye) makes food too alkaline for bacterial growth. Lye will
saponify fats in the food, which will change its flavor and texture. Lutefisk
uses lye in its preparation, as do some olive recipes. Modern recipes for
century_eggs also call for lye.
**** Canning ****
Preserved food
Main article: Canning
See also: Home_canning
Canning involves cooking food, sealing it in sterilized cans or jars, and
boiling the containers to kill or weaken any remaining bacteria as a form of
sterilization. It was invented by the French confectioner Nicolas_Appert.[8] By
1806, this process was used by the French Navy to preserve meat, fruit,
vegetables, and even milk. Although Appert had discovered a new way of
preservation, it wasn't understood until 1864 when Louis_Pasteur found the
relationship between microorganisms, food spoilage, and illness.[7]
Foods have varying degrees of natural protection against spoilage and may
require that the final step occur in a pressure_cooker. High-acid fruits like
strawberries require no preservatives to can and only a short boiling cycle,
whereas marginal vegetables such as carrots require longer boiling and addition
of other acidic elements. Low-acid foods, such as vegetables and meats, require
pressure canning. Food preserved by canning or bottling is at immediate risk of
spoilage once the can or bottle has been opened.
Lack of quality control in the canning process may allow ingress of water or
micro-organisms. Most such failures are rapidly detected as decomposition
within the can causes gas production and the can will swell or burst. However,
there have been examples of poor manufacture (underprocessing) and poor hygiene
allowing contamination of canned food by the obligate anaerobe Clostridium
botulinum, which produces an acute toxin within the food, leading to severe
illness or death. This organism produces no gas or obvious taste and remains
undetected by taste or smell. Its toxin is denatured by cooking, however.
Cooked mushrooms, handled poorly and then canned, can support the growth of
Staphylococcus_aureus, which produces a toxin that is not destroyed by canning
or subsequent reheating.
**** Jellying ****
Main article: Aspic
See also: Potted_shrimps and Confit
Food may be preserved by cooking in a material that solidifies to form a gel.
Such materials include gelatin, agar, maize flour, and arrowroot flour. Some
foods naturally form a protein gel when cooked, such as eels_and_elvers, and
sipunculid worms, which are a delicacy in Xiamen, in the Fujian province of the
People's_Republic_of_China. Jellied_eels are a delicacy in the East End of
London, where they are eaten with mashed potatoes. Potted meats in aspic (a gel
made from gelatin and clarified meat broth) were a common way of serving meat
off-cuts in the UK until the 1950s. Many jugged meats are also jellied.
A traditional British way of preserving meat (particularly shrimp) is by
setting it in a pot and sealing it with a layer of fat. Also common is potted
chicken liver; jellying is one of the steps in producing traditional pÃ¢tÃ©s.
**** Jugging ****
Main article: Jugging
Meat can be preserved by jugging. Jugging is the process of stewing the meat
(commonly game or fish) in a covered earthenware jug or casserole. The animal
to be jugged is usually cut into pieces, placed into a tightly-sealed jug with
brine or gravy, and stewed. Red_wine and/or the animal's own blood is sometimes
added to the cooking liquid. Jugging was a popular method of preserving meat up
until the middle of the 20th century.
**** Burial ****
Burial of food can preserve it due to a variety of factors: lack of light, lack
of oxygen, cool temperatures, pH level, or desiccants in the soil. Burial may
be combined with other methods such as salting or fermentation. Most foods can
be preserved in soil that is very dry and salty (thus a desiccant) such as
sand, or soil that is frozen.
Many root_vegetables are very resistant to spoilage and require no other
preservation than storage in cool dark conditions, for example by burial in the
ground, such as in a storage_clamp. Century_eggs are traditionally created by
placing eggs in alkaline mud (or other alkaline substance), resulting in their
"inorganic" fermentation through raised pH instead of spoiling. The
fermentation preserves them and breaks down some of the complex, less flavorful
proteins and fats into simpler, more flavorful ones. Cabbage was traditionally
buried during Autumn in northern US farms for preservation. Some methods keep
it crispy while other methods produce sauerkraut.[citation_needed] A similar
process is used in the traditional production of kimchi. Sometimes meat is
buried under conditions that cause preservation. If buried on hot coals or
ashes, the heat can kill pathogens, the dry ash can desiccate, and the earth
can block oxygen and further contamination. If buried where the earth is very
cold, the earth acts like a refrigerator.
In Orissa,_India, it is practical to store rice by burying it underground. This
method helps to store for three to six months during the dry season.
Butter and similar substances have been preserved as bog_butter in Irish peat
bogs for centuries.
**** Confit ****
Meat can be preserved by salting it, cooking it at or near 100 Â°C in some kind
of fat (such as lard or tallow), and then storing it immersed in the fat. These
preparations were popular in Europe before refrigerators became ubiquitous.
They are still popular in France, where they are called confit.[9][10] The
preparation will keep longer if stored in a cold cellar or buried in cold
ground.
**** Fermentation ****
See also: Fermentation_(food)
Some foods, such as many cheeses, wines, and beers, use specific micro-
organisms that combat spoilage from other less-benign organisms. These micro-
organisms keep pathogens in check by creating an environment toxic for
themselves and other micro-organisms by producing acid or alcohol. Methods of
fermentation include, but are not limited to, starter micro-organisms, salt,
hops, controlled (usually cool) temperatures and controlled (usually low)
levels of oxygen. These methods are used to create the specific controlled
conditions that will support the desirable organisms that produce food fit for
human consumption.
Fermentation is the microbial conversion of starch and sugars into alcohol. Not
only can fermentation produce alcohol, but it can also be a valuable
preservation technique. Fermentation can also make foods more nutritious and
palatable. For example, drinking water in the Middle Ages was dangerous because
it often contained pathogens that could spread disease. When the water is made
into beer, the boiling during the brewing process kills any bacteria in the
water that could make people sick. Additionally, the water now has the
nutrients from the barley and other ingredients, and the microorganisms can
also produce vitamins as they ferment.[7]
***** Modern industrial techniques *****
Techniques of food preservation were developed in research laboratories for
commercial applications.
**** Pasteurization ****
Main article: Pasteurization
Pasteurization is a process for preservation of liquid food. It was originally
applied to combat the souring of young local wines. Today, the process is
mainly applied to dairy products. In this method, milk is heated at about
70 Â°C (158 Â°F) for 15â30 seconds to kill the bacteria present in it and
cooling it quickly to 10 Â°C (50 Â°F) to prevent the remaining bacteria from
growing. The milk is then stored in sterilized bottles or pouches in cold
places. This method was invented by Louis_Pasteur, a French chemist, in 1862.
**** Vacuum packing ****
Main article: Vacuum_packing
Vacuum-packing stores food in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag
or bottle. The vacuum environment strips bacteria of oxygen needed for
survival. Vacuum-packing is commonly used for storing nuts to reduce loss of
flavor from oxidization. A major drawback to vacuum packaging, at the consumer
level, is that vacuum sealing can deform contents and rob certain foods, such
as cheese, of its flavor.
**** Freeze drying ****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (September
         2018)
Main article: Freeze_drying
**** Artificial food additives ****
Main article: Preservatives
Preservative food additives can be antimicrobialâwhich inhibit the growth of
bacteria or fungi, including moldâor antioxidant, such as oxygen_absorbers,
which inhibit the oxidation of food constituents. Common antimicrobial
preservatives include calcium_propionate, sodium_nitrate, sodium_nitrite,
sulfites (sulfur_dioxide, sodium_bisulfite, potassium_hydrogen_sulfite, etc.),
and EDTA. Antioxidants include butylated_hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated
hydroxytoluene (BHT). Other preservatives include formaldehyde (usually in
solution), glutaraldehyde (insecticide), ethanol, and
methylchloroisothiazolinone.
**** Irradiation ****
Main article: Food_irradiation
Irradiation of food[11] is the exposure of food to ionizing_radiation. Multiple
types of ionizing radiation can be used, including beta_particles (high-energy
electrons) and gamma_rays (emitted from radioactive sources such as cobalt-60
or cesium-137). Irradiation can kill bacteria, molds, and insect pests, reduce
the ripening and spoiling of fruits, and at higher doses induce sterility. The
technology may be compared to pasteurization; it is sometimes called "cold
pasteurization", as the product is not heated. Irradiation may allow lower-
quality or contaminated foods to be rendered marketable.
National and international expert bodies have declared food irradiation as
"wholesome"; organizations of the United_Nations, such as the World_Health
Organization and Food_and_Agriculture_Organization, endorse food irradiation.
[12][13] Consumers may have a negative view of irradiated food based on the
misconception that such food is radioactive;[14] in fact, irradiated food does
not and cannot become radioactive. Activists have also opposed food irradiation
for other reasons, for example, arguing that irradiation can be used to
sterilize contaminated food without resolving the underlying cause of the
contamination.[15] International legislation on whether food may be irradiated
or not varies worldwide from no regulation to a full ban.[16]
Approximately 500,000 tons of food items are irradiated per year worldwide in
over 40 countries. These are mainly spices and condiments, with an increasing
segment of fresh fruit irradiated for fruit fly quarantine.[17][18]
**** Pulsed electric field electroporation ****
Main article: Electroporation
Pulsed electric field (PEF) electroporation is a method for processing cells by
means of brief pulses of a strong electric field. PEF holds potential as a type
of low-temperature alternative pasteurization process for sterilizing food
products. In PEF processing, a substance is placed between two electrodes, then
the pulsed electric field is applied. The electric field enlarges the pores of
the cell membranes, which kills the cells and releases their contents. PEF for
food processing is a developing technology still being researched. There have
been limited industrial applications of PEF processing for the pasteurization
of fruit juices. To date, several PEF treated juices are available on the
market in Europe. Furthermore, for several years a juice pasteurization
application in the US has used PEF. For cell disintegration purposes especially
potato processors show great interest in PEF technology as an efficient
alternative for their preheaters. Potato applications are already operational
in the US and Canada. There are also commercial PEF potato applications in
various countries in Europe, as well as in Australia, India, and China.[19]
**** Modified atmosphere ****
Main article: Modified_atmosphere
Modifying atmosphere is a way to preserve food by operating on the atmosphere
around it. Salad crops that are notoriously difficult to preserve are now being
packaged in sealed bags with an atmosphere modified to reduce the oxygen (O2)
concentration and increase the carbon_dioxide (CO2) concentration. There is
concern that, although salad vegetables retain their appearance and texture in
such conditions, this method of preservation may not retain nutrients,
especially vitamins. There are two methods for preserving grains with carbon
dioxide. One method is placing a block of dry_ice in the bottom and filling the
can with the grain. Another method is purging the container from the bottom by
gaseous carbon dioxide from a cylinder or bulk supply vessel.
Carbon_dioxide prevents insects and, depending on concentration, mold and
oxidation from damaging the grain. Grain stored in this way can remain edible
for approximately five years.[20]
Nitrogen gas (N2) at concentrations of 98% or higher is also used effectively
to kill insects in the grain through hypoxia.[21] However, carbon dioxide has
an advantage in this respect, as it kills organisms through hypercarbia and
hypoxia (depending on concentration), but it requires concentrations of above
35%,[22] or so. This makes carbon dioxide preferable for fumigation in
situations where a hermetic_seal cannot be maintained.
Controlled Atmospheric Storage (CA): "CA storage is a non-chemical process.
Oxygen levels in the sealed rooms are reduced, usually by the infusion of
nitrogen gas, from the approximate 21 percent in the air we breathe to 1
percent or 2 percent. Temperatures are kept at a constant 0â2 Â°C
(32â36 Â°F). Humidity is maintained at 95 percent and carbon dioxide levels
are also controlled. Exact conditions in the rooms are set according to the
apple variety. Researchers develop specific regimens for each variety to
achieve the best quality. Computers help keep conditions constant." "Eastern
Washington, where most of Washingtonâs apples are grown, has enough warehouse
storage for 181 million boxes of fruit, according to a report done in 1997 by
managers for the Washington State Department of Agriculture Plant Services
Division. The storage capacity study shows that 67 percent of that
spaceâenough for 121,008,000 boxes of applesâis CA storage." [23]
Air-tight storage of grains (sometimes called hermetic storage) relies on the
respiration of grain, insects, and fungi that can modify the enclosed
atmosphere sufficiently to control insect pests. This is a method of great
antiquity,[24] as well as having modern equivalents. The success of the method
relies on having the correct mix of sealing, grain moisture, and temperature.
[25]
A patented process uses fuel_cells to exhaust and automatically maintain the
exhaustion of oxygen in a shipping container, containing, for example, fresh
fish.[26]
**** Nonthermal plasma ****
Main article: Nonthermal_plasma
This process subjects the surface of food to a "flame" of ionized gas
molecules, such as helium or nitrogen. This causes micro-organisms to die off
on the surface.[27]
**** High-pressure food preservation ****
Main article: Pascalization
High-pressure food preservation or pascalization refers to the use of a food
preservation technique that makes use of high_pressure. "Pressed inside a
vessel exerting 70,000 pounds per square inch (480 MPa) or more, food can be
processed so that it retains its fresh appearance, flavor, texture and
nutrients while disabling harmful microorganisms and slowing spoilage." By
2005, the process was being used for products ranging from orange_juice to
guacamole to deli_meats and widely sold.[28]
**** Biopreservation ****
3D stick model of nisin. Some lactic_acid_bacteria manufacture nisin. It is a
particularly effective preservative.
Main article: Biopreservation
Biopreservation is the use of natural or controlled microbiota or
antimicrobials as a way of preserving food and extending its shelf_life.[29]
Beneficial bacteria or the fermentation products produced by these bacteria are
used in biopreservation to control spoilage and render pathogens inactive in
food.[30] It is a benign ecological approach which is gaining increasing
attention.[29]
Of special interest are lactic_acid_bacteria (LAB). Lactic acid bacteria have
antagonistic properties that make them particularly useful as biopreservatives.
When LABs compete for nutrients, their metabolites often include active
antimicrobials such as lactic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and peptide
bacteriocins. Some LABs produce the antimicrobial nisin, which is a
particularly effective preservative.[31][32]
These days, LAB bacteriocins are used as an integral part of hurdle_technology.
Using them in combination with other preservative techniques can effectively
control spoilage bacteria and other pathogens, and can inhibit the activities
of a wide spectrum of organisms, including inherently resistant Gram-negative
bacteria.[29]
**** Hurdle technology ****
Main article: Hurdle_technology
Hurdle_technology is a method of ensuring that pathogens in food_products can
be eliminated or controlled by combining more than one approach. These
approaches can be thought of as "hurdles" the pathogen has to overcome if it is
to remain active in the food. The right combination of hurdles can ensure all
pathogens are eliminated or rendered harmless in the final product.[33]
Hurdle technology has been defined by Leistner (2000) as an intelligent
combination of hurdles that secures the microbial safety and stability as well
as the organoleptic and nutritional quality and the economic viability of food
products.[34] The organoleptic quality of the food refers to its sensory
properties, that is its look, taste, smell, and texture.
Examples of hurdles in a food system are high temperature during processing,
low temperature during storage, increasing the acidity, lowering the water
activity or redox_potential, and the presence of preservatives or
biopreservatives. According to the type of pathogens and how risky they are,
the intensity of the hurdles can be adjusted individually to meet consumer
preferences in an economical way, without sacrificing the safety of the
product.[33]
Principal hurdles used for food preservation (after Leistner, 1995)[35][36]
Parameter               Symbol Application
High temperature        F      Heating
Low temperature         T      Chilling, freezing
Reduced water_activity  aw     Drying, curing, conserving
Increased acidity       pH     Acid addition or formation
Reduced redox_potential Eh     Removal of oxygen or addition of ascorbate
Biopreservatives               Competitive flora such as microbial fermentation
Other preservatives            Sorbates, sulfites, nitrites
