Agricultural machinery is machinery used in farming or other agriculture. There
are many_types_of_such_equipment, from hand_tools and power_tools to tractors
and the countless kinds of farm implements that they tow or operate. Diverse
arrays of equipment are used in both organic and nonorganic farming. Especially
since the advent of mechanised_agriculture, agricultural machinery is an
indispensable part of how the world is fed.

***** History[edit] *****
**** The Industrial Revolution[edit] ****
With the coming of the Industrial_Revolution and the development of more
complicated machines, farming methods took a great leap forward.[1] Instead of
harvesting grain by hand with a sharp blade, wheeled machines cut a continuous
swath. Instead of threshing the grain by beating it with sticks, threshing
machines separated the seeds from the heads and stalks. The first tractors
appeared in the late 19th century.[2]
**** Steam power[edit] ****
Power for agricultural machinery was originally supplied by ox or other
domesticated_animals. With the invention of steam_power came the portable
engine, and later the traction_engine, a multipurpose, mobile energy source
that was the ground-crawling cousin to the steam_locomotive. Agricultural steam
engines took over the heavy pulling work of oxen, and were also equipped with a
pulley that could power stationary machines via the use of a long belt. The
steam-powered machines were low-powered by today's standards but, because of
their size and their low gear_ratios, they could provide a large drawbar pull.
Their slow speed led farmers to comment that tractors had two speeds: "slow,
and damn slow."
**** Internal combustion engines[edit] ****
The internal_combustion_engine; first the petrol_engine, and later diesel
engines; became the main source of power for the next generation of tractors.
These engines also contributed to the development of the self-propelled,
combined harvester and thresher, or combine_harvester (also shortened to
'combine'). Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a
stationary threshing_machine, these combines cut, threshed, and separated the
grain while moving continuously through the field.
***** Types[edit] *****

Combines might have taken the harvesting job away from tractors, but tractors
still do the majority of work on a modern farm. They are used to push/pull
implementsâmachines that till the ground, plant seed, and perform other
tasks.
Tillage implements prepare the soil for planting by loosening the soil and
killing weeds or competing plants. The best-known is the plow, the ancient
implement that was upgraded in 1838 by John_Deere. Plows are now used less
frequently in the U.S. than formerly, with offset disks used instead to turn
over the soil, and chisels used to gain the depth needed to retain moisture.
The most common type of seeder is called a planter, and spaces seeds out
equally in long rows, which are usually two to three feet apart. Some crops are
planted by drills, which put out much more seed in rows less than a foot apart,
blanketing the field with crops. Transplanters automate the task of
transplanting seedlings to the field. With the widespread use of plastic_mulch,
plastic mulch layers, transplanters, and seeders lay down long rows of plastic,
and plant through them automatically.
After planting, other implements can be used to cultivate weeds from between
rows, or to spread fertilizer and pesticides. Hay balers can be used to tightly
package grass or alfalfa into a storable form for the winter months.
Modern irrigation relies on machinery. Engines, pumps and other specialized
gear provide water quickly and in high volumes to large areas of land. Similar
types of equipment can be used to deliver fertilizers and pesticides.
Besides the tractor, other vehicles have been adapted for use in farming,
including trucks, airplanes, and helicopters, such as for transporting crops
and making equipment mobile, to aerial spraying and livestock herd management.
***** New technology and the future[edit] *****
Main articles: Digital_agriculture and Precision_agriculture
The basic technology of agricultural machines has changed little in the last
century. Though modern harvesters and planters may do a better job or be
slightly tweaked from their predecessors, the US$250,000 combine of today still
cuts, threshes, and separates grain in the same way it has always been done.
However, technology is changing the way that humans operate the machines, as
computer monitoring systems, GPS locators and self-steer programs allow the
most advanced tractors and implements to be more precise and less wasteful in
the use of fuel, seed, or fertilizer. In the foreseeable future, there may be
mass production of driverless_tractors, which use GPS maps and electronic
sensors.
**** Open source agricultural equipment[edit] ****
Many farmers are upset by their inability to fix the new types of high-tech
farm equipment.[3] This is due mostly to companies using intellectual_property
law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment (or
gain access to the information to allow them to do it).[4] In October 2015 an
exemption was added to the DMCA to allow inspection and modification of the
software in cars and other vehicles including agricultural machinery.[5]
The Open Source Agriculture movement counts different initiatives and
organizations such as Farm Labs which is a network in Europe[6], l'Atelier
Paysan which is a cooperative to teach farmers in France how to build and
repair their tools [7][8], and Ekylibre which is an open-source company to
provide farmers in France with open source software (SaaS) to manage farming
operations.[9][8] In the United States, the MIT_Media_Lab's Open_Agriculture
Initiative seeks to foster "the creation of an open-source ecosystem of
technologies that enable and promote transparency, networked experimentation,
education, and hyper-local production".[10] It develops the Personal_Food
Computer, an educational project to create a "controlled environment
agriculture technology platform that uses robotic systems to control and
monitor climate, energy, and plant growth inside of a specialized growing
chamber". It includes the development of Open_Phenom[11], an open source
library with open data sets for climate recipes which link the phenotype
response of plants (taste, nutrition) to environmental variables, biological,
genetic and resource-related necessary for cultivation (input).[12] Plants with
the same genetics can naturally vary in color, size, texture growth rate,
yield, flavor and nutrient density according to the environmental conditions in
which they are produced.
