Water covers 70% of the Earth's surface.
Hydrology (from Greek: á½Î´ÏÏ, "hÃ½dÅr" meaning "water"; and Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï,
"lÃ³gos" meaning "study") is the scientific study of the movement,
distribution, and quality of water on Earth and other planets, including the
water_cycle, water_resources and environmental watershed sustainability. A
practitioner of hydrology is a hydrologist, working within the fields of earth
or environmental_science, physical_geography, geology or civil and
environmental_engineering.[1] Using various analytical methods and scientific
techniques, they collect and analyze data to help solve water related problems
such as environmental_preservation, natural_disasters, and water_management.[1]
Hydrology subdivides into surface water hydrology, groundwater hydrology
(hydrogeology), and marine hydrology. Domains of hydrology include
hydrometeorology, surface_hydrology, hydrogeology, drainage-basin management
and water_quality, where water plays the central role.
Oceanography and meteorology are not included because water is only one of many
important aspects within those fields.
Hydrological research can inform environmental engineering, policy and
planning.

Hydrology has been a subject of investigation and engineering for millennia.
For example, about 4000 BC the Nile was dammed to improve agricultural
productivity of previously barren lands. Mesopotamian towns were protected from
flooding with high earthen walls. Aqueducts were built by the Greeks and
Ancient_Romans, while the history_of_China shows they built irrigation and
flood control works. The ancient Sinhalese used hydrology to build complex
irrigation works in Sri_Lanka, also known for invention of the Valve Pit which
allowed construction of large reservoirs, anicuts and canals which still
function.
Marcus_Vitruvius, in the first century BC, described a philosophical theory of
the hydrologic cycle, in which precipitation falling in the mountains
infiltrated the Earth's surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands.
[citation_needed] With adoption of a more scientific approach, Leonardo_da
Vinci and Bernard_Palissy independently reached an accurate representation of
the hydrologic cycle. It was not until the 17th century that hydrologic
variables began to be quantified.
Pioneers of the modern science of hydrology include Pierre_Perrault, Edme
Mariotte and Edmund_Halley. By measuring rainfall, runoff, and drainage area,
Perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for flow of the Seine.
Marriotte combined velocity and river cross-section measurements to obtain
discharge, again in the Seine. Halley showed that the evaporation from the
Mediterranean_Sea was sufficient to account for the outflow of rivers flowing
into the sea.[2]
Advances in the 18th century included the Bernoulli piezometer and Bernoulli's
equation, by Daniel_Bernoulli, and the Pitot_tube, by Henri_Pitot. The 19th
century saw development in groundwater hydrology, including Darcy's_law, the
Dupuit-Thiem well formula, and Hagen-Poiseuille's capillary flow equation.
Rational analyses began to replace empiricism in the 20th century, while
governmental agencies began their own hydrological research programs. Of
particular importance were Leroy Sherman's unit_hydrograph, the infiltration
theory of Robert_E._Horton, and C.V. Theis's aquifer test/equation describing
well hydraulics.
Since the 1950s, hydrology has been approached with a more theoretical basis
than in the past, facilitated by advances in the physical understanding of
hydrological processes and by the advent of computers and especially geographic
information_systems (GIS). (See also GIS_and_hydrology)
***** Themes[edit] *****
Main article: Water_cycle
The central theme of hydrology is that water circulates throughout the Earth
through different pathways and at different rates. The most vivid image of this
is in the evaporation of water from the ocean, which forms clouds. These clouds
drift over the land and produce rain. The rainwater flows into lakes, rivers,
or aquifers. The water in lakes, rivers, and aquifers then either evaporates
back to the atmosphere or eventually flows back to the ocean, completing a
cycle. Water changes its state of being several times throughout this cycle.
The areas of research within hydrology concern the movement of water between
its various states, or within a given state, or simply quantifying the amounts
in these states in a given region. Parts of hydrology concern developing
methods for directly measuring these flows or amounts of water, while others
concern modelling these processes either for scientific knowledge or for making
prediction in practical applications.
**** Groundwater[edit] ****
Building a map of groundwater contours
Ground water is water beneath Earth's surface, often pumped for drinking water.
[1] Groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology) considers quantifying groundwater flow
and solute transport.[3] Problems in describing the saturated zone include the
characterization of aquifers in terms of flow direction, groundwater pressure
and, by inference, groundwater depth (see: aquifer_test). Measurements here can
be made using a piezometer. Aquifers are also described in terms of hydraulic
conductivity, storativity and transmissivity. There are a number of geophysical
methods[4] for characterising aquifers. There are also problems in
characterising the vadose zone (unsaturated zone).[5]
**** Infiltration[edit] ****
Main article: Infiltration_(hydrology)
Infiltration is the process by which water enters the soil. Some of the water
is absorbed, and the rest percolates down to the water_table. The infiltration
capacity, the maximum rate at which the soil can absorb water, depends on
several factors. The layer that is already saturated provides a resistance that
is proportional to its thickness, while that plus the depth of water above the
soil provides the driving force (hydraulic_head). Dry soil can allow rapid
infiltration by capillary_action; this force diminishes as the soil becomes
wet. Compaction reduces the porosity and the pore sizes. Surface cover
increases capacity by retarding runoff, reducing compaction and other
processes. Higher temperatures reduce viscosity, increasing infiltration.[6]:
250â275
**** Soil moisture[edit] ****
Main article: Soil_moisture
Soil moisture can be measured in various ways; by capacitance_probe, time
domain_reflectometer or Tensiometer. Other methods include solute sampling and
geophysical methods.
**** Surface water flow[edit] ****
Hydrology considers quantifying surface water flow and solute transport,
although the treatment of flows in large rivers is sometimes considered as a
distinct topic of hydraulics or hydrodynamics. Surface water flow can include
flow both in recognizable river channels and otherwise. Methods for measuring
flow once water has reached a river include the stream_gauge (see: discharge),
and tracer techniques. Other topics include chemical transport as part of
surface water, sediment transport and erosion.
One of the important areas of hydrology is the interchange between rivers and
aquifers. Groundwater/surface water interactions in streams and aquifers can be
complex and the direction of net water flux (into surface water or into the
aquifer) may vary spatially along a stream channel and over time at any
particular location, depending on the relationship between stream stage and
groundwater levels.
**** Precipitation and evaporation[edit] ****
In some considerations, hydrology is thought of as starting at the land-
atmosphere boundary[citation_needed] and so it is important to have adequate
knowledge of both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation can be measured
in various ways: disdrometer for precipitation characteristics at a fine time
scale; radar for cloud properties, rain rate estimation, hail and snow
detection; rain_gauge for routine accurate measurements of rain and snowfall;
satellite for rainy area identification, rain rate estimation, land-cover/land-
use, and soil moisture, for example.
Evaporation is an important part of the water cycle. It is partly affected by
humidity, which can be measured by a sling_psychrometer. It is also affected by
the presence of snow, hail and ice and can relate to dew, mist and fog.
Hydrology considers evaporation of various forms: from water surfaces; as
transpiration from plant surfaces in natural and agronomic ecosystems. A direct
measurement of evaporation can be obtained using Simon's evaporation_pan.
Detailed studies of evaporation involve boundary layer considerations as well
as momentum, heat flux and energy budgets.
**** Remote sensing[edit] ****
Main article: Remote_sensing
Remote sensing of hydrologic processes can provide information on locations
where in situ sensors may be unavailable or sparse. It also enables
observations over large spatial extents. Many of the variables constituting the
terrestrial water balance, for example surface_water storage, soil_moisture,
precipitation, evapotranspiration, and snow and ice, are measurable using
remote sensing at various spatial-temporal resolutions and accuracies.[7]
Sources of remote sensing include land-based sensors, airborne sensors and
satellite_sensors which can capture microwave, thermal_and_near-infrared data
or use lidar, for example.
**** Water quality[edit] ****
Main article: Water_quality
In hydrology, studies of water quality concern organic and inorganic compounds,
and both dissolved and sediment material. In addition, water quality is
affected by the interaction of dissolved oxygen with organic material and
various chemical transformations that may take place. Measurements of water
quality may involve either in-situ methods, in which analyses take place on-
site, often automatically, and laboratory-based analyses and may include
microbiological_analysis.
**** Integrating measurement and modelling[edit] ****
    * Budget analyses
    * Parameter estimation
    * Scaling in time and space
    * Data_assimilation
    * Quality control of data â see for example Double_mass_analysis
**** Prediction[edit] ****
Observations of hydrologic processes are used to make predictions of the future
behaviour of hydrologic systems (water flow, water quality). One of the major
current concerns in hydrologic research is "Prediction in Ungauged Basins"
(PUB), i.e. in basins where no or only very few data exist.
**** Statistical hydrology[edit] ****
By analyzing the statistical properties of hydrologic records, such as rainfall
or river flow, hydrologists can estimate future hydrologic phenomena. When
making assessments of how often relatively rare events will occur, analyses are
made in terms of the return_period of such events. Other quantities of interest
include the average flow in a river, in a year or by season.
These estimates are important for engineers and economists so that proper risk
analysis can be performed to influence investment decisions in future
infrastructure and to determine the yield reliability characteristics of water
supply systems. Statistical information is utilized to formulate operating
rules for large dams forming part of systems which include agricultural,
industrial and residential demands.
**** Modeling[edit] ****
Main article: Hydrological_modelling
Hydrological models are simplified, conceptual representations of a part of the
hydrologic cycle. They are primarily used for hydrological prediction and for
understanding hydrological processes, within the general field of scientific
modeling. Two major types of hydrological models can be distinguished:[citation
needed]
    * Models based on data. These models are black_box systems, using
      mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for
      instance rainfall) to the model output (for instance runoff). Commonly
      used techniques are regression, transfer_functions, and system
      identification. The simplest of these models may be linear models, but it
      is common to deploy non-linear components to represent some general
      aspects of a catchment's response without going deeply into the real
      physical processes involved. An example of such an aspect is the well-
      known behavior that a catchment will respond much more quickly and
      strongly when it is already wet than when it is dry..
    * Models based on process descriptions. These models try to represent the
      physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models
      contain representations of surface_runoff, subsurface_flow,
      evapotranspiration, and channel_flow, but they can be far more
      complicated. These models are known as deterministic hydrology models.
      Deterministic hydrology models can be subdivided into single-event models
      and continuous simulation models.
Recent research in hydrological modeling tries to have a more global approach
to the understanding of the behavior_of_hydrologic_systems to make better
predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management.
**** Transport[edit] ****
Main article: Hydrologic_transport_model
Water movement is a significant means by which other material, such as soil,
gravel, boulders or pollutants, are transported from place to place. Initial
input to receiving waters may arise from a point_source discharge or a line
source or area_source, such as surface_runoff. Since the 1960s rather complex
mathematical_models have been developed, facilitated by the availability of
high speed computers. The most common pollutant classes analyzed are nutrients,
pesticides, total_dissolved_solids and sediment.
