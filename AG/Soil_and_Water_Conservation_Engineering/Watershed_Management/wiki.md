****** Watershed management ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Watershed management is the study of the relevant characteristics of a
watershed aimed at the sustainable distribution of its resources and the
process of creating and implementing plans, programs, and projects to sustain
and enhance watershed functions that affect the plant, animal, and human
communities within the watershed boundary.[1] Features of watershed that
agencies seek to manage include water_supply, water_quality, drainage,
stormwater_runoff, water_rights, and the overall planning and utilization of
watersheds. Landowners, land_use agencies, stormwater management experts,
environmental specialists, water use surveyors and communities all play an
integral part in watershed management.

***** Controlling pollution[edit] *****
In agricultural systems, common practices include the use of buffer_strips,
grassed waterways, the re-establishment of wetlands, and forms of sustainable
agriculture practices such as conservation_tillage, crop_rotation and inter-
cropping. After certain practices are installed, it is important to
continuously monitor these systems to ensure that they are working properly in
terms of improving environmental quality.
In urban settings, managing areas to prevent soil loss and control stormwater
flow are a few of the areas that receive attention. A few practices that are
used to manage stormwater before it reaches a channel are retention_ponds,
filtering systems and wetlands. It is important that storm-water is given an
opportunity to infiltrate so that the soil and vegetation can act as a "filter"
before the water reaches nearby streams or lakes. In the case of soil erosion
prevention, a few common practices include the use of silt fences, landscape
fabric with grass seed and hydroseeding. The main objective in all cases is to
slow water movement to prevent soil transport.
***** Governance[edit] *****
The 2nd World_Water_Forum held in The Hague in March 2000 raised some
controversies that exposed the multilateral nature and imbalance the demand and
supply management of freshwater. While donor organizations, private and
government institutions backed by the World_Bank, believe that freshwater
should be governed as an economic good by appropriate pricing, NGOs however,
held that freshwater resources should be seen as a social good.[2] The concept
of network_governance where all stakeholders form partnerships and voluntarily
share ideas towards forging a common vision can be used to resolve this clash
of opinion in freshwater management. Also, the implementation of any common
vision presents a new role for NGOs because of their unique capabilities in
local community coordination, thus making them a valuable partner in network
governance.[3]
Watersheds replicate this multilateral terrain with private industries and
local communities interconnected by a common watershed. Although these groups
share a common ecological space that could transcend state borders, their
interests, knowledge and use of resources within the watershed are mostly
disproportionate and divergent, resulting to the activities of a specific group
adversely impacting on other groups. Examples being the Minamata_Bay_poisoning
that occurred from 1932 to 1968, killing over 1,784 individuals and the
Wabigoon_River_incidence of 1962. Furthermore, while some knowledgeable groups
are shifting from efficient water resource exploitation to efficient
utilization, net gain for the watershed ecology could be lost when other groups
seize the opportunity to exploit more resources. This gap in cooperative
communication among multilateral stakeholders within an interconnected
watershed, even with the likely presence of the usually reactive and political
boundary-constraint state regulations, makes it necessary for the
institutionalization of an ecological-scale cooperative network of
stakeholders.[4] [5] This concept supports an integrated management style for
interconnected natural resources; resonating strongly with the Integrated_Water
Resources_Management system proposed by Global_Water_Partnership.
Moreover, the need to create partnerships between donor organizations, private
and government institutions and community representatives like NGOs in
watersheds is to enhance an "organizational society" among stakeholders.[6]
This posits a type of public-private_partnership, commonly referred to as Type
II partnership,[7] which essentially brings together stakeholders that share a
common watershed under a voluntary, idea sharing and collectively agreed vision
aimed at granting mutual benefits to all stakeholders. Also, it explicates the
concept of network_governance, which is "the only alternative for collective
action",[8] requiring government to rescale its role in decision making and
collaborate with other stakeholders on a level playing field rather than in an
administrative or hierarchical manner.
Several riparian states have adopted this concept in managing the increasingly
scarce resources of watersheds. These include the nine Rhine states, with a
common vision of pollution_control,[9] the Lake_Chad and river_Nile Basins,
whose common vision is to ensure environmental_sustainability.[10] As a partner
in the commonly shared vision, NGOs has adopted a new role in operationalizing
the implementation of regional watershed management policies at the local
level. For instance, essential local coordination and education are areas where
the services of NGOs have been effective.[11] This makes NGOs the "nuclei" for
successful watershed management.[3] Recently, artificial_Intelligence
techniques such as neural_networks have been utilized to address the problem of
watershed management.[12]
***** Environmental law[edit] *****
Main article: Environmental_law
Environmental laws often dictate the planning and actions that agencies take to
manage watersheds. Some laws require that planning be done, others can be used
to make a plan legally enforceable and others set out the ground rules for what
can and cannot be done in development and planning. Most countries and states
have their own laws regarding watershed management.
Those concerned about aquatic_habitat protection have a right to participate in
the laws and planning processes that affect aquatic habitats. By having a clear
understanding of whom to speak to and how to present the case for keeping our
waterways clean a member of the public can become an effective watershed
protection advocate.
