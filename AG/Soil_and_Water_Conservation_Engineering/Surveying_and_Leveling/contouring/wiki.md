Contouring is a makeup technique that uses cosmetics to define, enhance and
sculpt the structure of the face[1] or other body parts, such as breasts.[2]
Contouring is usually produced by placing a warm or cool toned colour that is
one or two shades darker than the skin color in areas such as in the hollows of
the cheeks, on the side of the nose, and on the temples to give a shadow and
slimming effect. It can be complemented with a highlighter that is one or two
shades lighter than the skin color on areas of the face that is more prominent
such as on the apples on the cheeks and the tip of the nose or the t-zone. This
technique can also be referred to as strobing, which generally uses only
lighter powders and shades and little to no darker ones.
***** History[edit] *****
In the 16th century, contouring was used by Elizabethan stage actors, who would
apply chalk and soot to their faces to help audience members read their facial
expressions.[3]
In the late 1800s, when electricity was invented and lights were widely used,
soot was no longer an option. Instead of soot, actors would use greasepaint to
help audience members decipher their emotions. In 1800s-1900s, Queen Victoria
deemed makeup as vulgar, as only stage actors and prostitutes wore makeup.
Makeup could only be purchased in costume stores.[3]
In the 1920s and 1930s, contouring could be seen in the film world. German
actress Marlene_Dietrich would contour her face for her films. She would
accentuate the natural lines of her face with shading and sculpting.[3]
In 1934, makeup artist Max_Factor_Sr. was famous for applying makeup for stage
actors. He added shading to the face so that it wouldn't appear flat on film.
In 1945, he presented the first tutorial on how to contour the face, for
different face shapes.[3]
In 1944, Ben Nye, a famous makeup artist, did the makeup for characters in Gone
with_the_Wind and Planet_of_the_Apes. He then created his own makeup line,
which is still popular today.[3]
In the 1950s, a time of Old Hollywood glamour, features were subtly contoured
and shaded. This method was used by such actresses as Audrey_Hepburn, Marilyn
Monroe, and Elizabeth_Taylor.[3]
In the 1990s, makeup artist Kevyn_Aucoin was wholly responsible for the
sculpted, chiseled look of many celebrities and top models, including Cher,
Madonna, Gwyneth_Paltrow, Cindy_Crawford, and Janet_Jackson.[3] In October
2000, he published his industry defining cosmetics book, Face_Forward, which
became a New_York_Times bestseller. The book was widely noted for introducing
makeup sculpting and contouring to the general public for the first time.
In the 2000s, the practice of "body contouring" â the application of
contouring to other parts of the body than the face, such as shinbones or
breasts ("boob contouring") â became more widely noticed as a result of the
increasing number of images of celebrities appearing in social_media.[2]
In the 2010s, contouring became even more intense as makeup techniques
advanced. While contouring has existed for centuries to some extent, the
technique was revolutionized by celebrities and makeup artists incorporating it
even more into their looks. The trend of contouring has taken over beauty
brands by prompting the sale of items meant specifically for contouring and
strobing, its lighter counterpart. Contouring developed from only people in the
public eye practicing it to more affordable and accessible brands manufacturing
products so all people can use the technique. The practice is often used by
drag_queens to emphasize feminine features and soften masculine ones.
Contouring is used largely to not only accentuate features present on the face,
but also hide or change features that are unwanted. Products often used include
powder contour, often coming in palettes with both light and dark colors for
highlighting and contouring, as well as cream contour products that can create
a more emphasized look. [4]
