Flow of gases or air on a large scale
For other uses, see Wind_(disambiguation).

Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale. On the surface of the Earth, wind
consists of the bulk movement of air. In outer_space, solar_wind is the
movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while
planetary_wind is the outgassing of light chemical_elements from a planet's
atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial_scale,
their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they
occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar
System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects: velocity (wind
speed); the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind_energy. Wind is
also an important means of transportation for seeds and small birds; with time
things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.
In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and
the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high-speed wind
are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are
termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their
average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs on a
range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local
breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to
global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar_energy
between the climate_zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale
atmospheric_circulation are the differential heating between the equator and
the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis_effect). Within the
tropics, thermal_low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive
monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea_breeze/land breeze cycle can
define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley
breezes can dominate local winds.
In human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in mythology,
influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare,
and provided a power_source for mechanical work, electricity and recreation.
Wind powers the voyages of sailing_ships across Earth's oceans. Hot_air
balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to
increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind_shear caused by
various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When
winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.
Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian_processes such as the
formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large
deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing
winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust
outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world
because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the
spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the
survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect
populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact
on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and
defensive strategies.

***** Causes[edit] *****
See also: Atmospheric_pressure
Surface_analysis of the Great_Blizzard_of_1888. Areas with greater isobaric
packing indicate higher winds.
Wind is caused by differences in the atmospheric_pressure. When a difference_in
atmospheric_pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure
area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also
be deflected by the Coriolis_effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally,
the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric
circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles
(difference in absorption of solar_energy leading to buoyancy_forces) and the
rotation_of_the_planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects
of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic_balance.
Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would
be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-
pressure areas.[1][2]
Winds defined by an equilibrium of physical forces are used in the
decomposition and analysis of wind profiles. They are useful for simplifying
the atmospheric equations_of_motion and for making qualitative arguments about
the horizontal and vertical distribution of winds. The geostrophic_wind
component is the result of the balance between Coriolis force and pressure
gradient force. It flows parallel to isobars and approximates the flow above
the atmospheric_boundary_layer in the midlatitudes.[3] The thermal_wind is the
difference in the geostrophic wind between two levels in the atmosphere. It
exists only in an atmosphere with horizontal temperature_gradients.[4] The
ageostrophic_wind component is the difference between actual and geostrophic
wind, which is responsible for air "filling up" cyclones over time.[5] The
gradient_wind is similar to the geostrophic wind but also includes centrifugal
force (or centripetal_acceleration).[6]
***** Measurement[edit] *****
Cup-type anemometer with vertical axis, a sensor on a remote meteorological
station
An occluded mesocyclone tornado (Oklahoma, May 1999)
Wind_direction is usually expressed in terms of the direction from which it
originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south.[7]
Weather_vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind.[8] At airports,
windsocks indicate wind direction, and can also be used to estimate wind speed
by the angle of hang.[9] Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly
using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed
(such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation
speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance
of a heated wire.[10] Another type of anemometer uses pitot_tubes that take
advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube
that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then
used to compute the wind speed.[11]
Sustained wind speeds are reported globally at a 10 meters (33 ft) height and
are averaged over a 10âminute time frame. The United States reports winds
over a 1âminute average for tropical cyclones,[12] and a 2âminute average
within weather observations.[13] India typically reports winds over a
3âminute average.[14] Knowing the wind sampling average is important, as the
value of a one-minute sustained wind is typically 14% greater than a ten-minute
sustained wind.[15] A short burst of high speed wind is termed a wind_gust, one
technical definition of a wind gust is: the maxima that exceed the lowest wind
speed measured during a ten-minute time interval by 10 knots (19 km/h) for
periods of seconds. A squall is an increase of the wind speed above a certain
threshold, which lasts for a minute or more.
To determine winds aloft, rawinsondes determine wind speed by GPS, radio
navigation, or radar tracking of the probe.[16] Alternatively, movement of the
parent weather_balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using
theodolites.[17] Remote_sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler
lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler_shift of electromagnetic
radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and
radiometers and radars can be used to measure the surface roughness of the
ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind
velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery
can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far
clouds move from one image to the next. Wind_engineering describes the study of
the effects of the wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges
and other man-made objects.
***** Wind force scale[edit] *****
See also: Tropical_cyclone_scales and Surface_weather_analysis
Historically, the Beaufort_wind_force_scale (created by Beaufort) provides an
empirical description of wind speed based on observed sea conditions.
Originally it was a 13-level scale, but during the 1940s, the scale was
expanded to 17 levels.[18] There are general terms that differentiate winds of
different average speeds such as a breeze, a gale, a storm, tornado, or a
hurricane. Within the Beaufort scale, gale-force winds lie between 28 knots
(52 km/h) and 55 knots (102 km/h) with preceding adjectives such as moderate,
fresh, strong, and whole used to differentiate the wind's strength within the
gale category.[19] A storm has winds of 56 knots (104 km/h) to 63 knots
(117 km/h).[20] The terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region
to another globally. Most ocean basins use the average wind speed to determine
the tropical cyclone's category. Below is a summary of the classifications used
by Regional_Specialized_Meteorological_Centers worldwide:

**** Station model[edit] ****
Wind plotting within a station model
The station_model plotted on surface weather_maps uses a wind barb to show both
wind direction and speed. The wind barb shows the speed using "flags" on the
end.
    * Each half of a flag depicts 5 knots (9.3 km/h) of wind.
    * Each full flag depicts 10 knots (19 km/h) of wind.
    * Each pennant (filled triangle) depicts 50 knots (93 km/h) of wind.[22]
Winds are depicted as blowing from the direction the barb is facing. Therefore,
a northeast wind will be depicted with a line extending from the cloud circle
to the northeast, with flags indicating wind speed on the northeast end of this
line.[23] Once plotted on a map, an analysis of isotachs (lines of equal wind
speeds) can be accomplished. Isotachs are particularly useful in diagnosing the
location of the jet_stream on upper level constant pressure charts, and are
usually located at or above the 300 hPa level.[24]
***** Wind power[edit] *****
Main article: Wind_power
Wind energy is the kinetic_energy of the air in motion. The kinetic energy of a
packet of air of mass m with velocity v is given by Â½ m v2. To find the mass
of the packet passing through an area A perpendicular its velocity (which could
be the rotor area of a turbine), we multiply its volume after time t has passed
with the air_density Ï, which gives us m = A v t Ï. So, we find that the
total wind energy is:
         E =   1 2   &#x03C1; A  v  3   t   {\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}\rho
      Av^{3}t}  [E={\frac  {1}{2}}\rho Av^{3}t]
Differentiating with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy, we
find that the total wind power is:
         P = d E  /  d t =   1 2   &#x03C1; A  v  3     {\displaystyle P=dE/dt=
      {\frac {1}{2}}\rho Av^{3}}  [P=dE/dt={\frac  {1}{2}}\rho Av^{3}]
Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity.
**** Theoretical power captured by a wind turbine[edit] ****
Total wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to
zero. In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must
also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity
must be considered. Using the concept of stream_tube, the maximal achievable
extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 16/27 â 59% of the total
theoretical wind power[25] (see: Betz'_law).
**** Practical wind turbine power[edit] ****
Further insufficiencies, such as rotor blade friction and drag, gearbox losses,
generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine.
The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) proportional to
the third power of velocity remains.
***** Global climatology[edit] *****
Main article: Prevailing_winds
The westerlies and trade winds
Winds are part of Earth's atmospheric circulation
Easterly winds, on average, dominate the flow pattern across the poles,
westerly winds blow across the mid-latitudes of the earth, polewards of the
subtropical_ridge, while easterlies again dominate the tropics.
Directly under the subtropical ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes,
where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average
latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative_humidity
of the air mass.[26] The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold
polar air meets warm air from the tropics.
**** Tropics[edit] ****
See also: Trade_wind and Monsoon
The trade winds (also called trades) are the prevailing pattern of easterly
surface winds found in the tropics towards the Earth's equator.[27] The trade
winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from
the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere.[28] The trade winds act as the
steering_flow for tropical_cyclones that form over the world's oceans.[29]
Trade winds also steer African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the
Caribbean, as well as portions of southeast North America.[30]
A monsoon is a seasonal prevailing wind that lasts for several months within
tropical regions. The term was first used in English in India, Bangladesh,
Pakistan, and neighboring countries to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing
from the Indian_Ocean and Arabian_Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall
to the area.[31] Its poleward progression is accelerated by the development off
a heat low over the Asian, African, and North American continents during May
through July, and over Australia in December.[32][33][34]
**** Westerlies and their impact[edit] ****
Benjamin_Franklin's map of the Gulf_Stream
Main article: Westerlies
The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the prevailing_winds in the
middle_latitudes between 35 and 65 degrees latitude. These prevailing winds
blow from the west to the east,[35][36] and steer extratropical cyclones in
this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the
Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.[28] They
are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and
weakest during the summer and when pressures are higher over the poles.[37]
Together with the trade_winds, the westerlies enabled a round-trip trade route
for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies
lead to the development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans
in both hemispheres through the process of western_intensification.[38] These
western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the
polar_regions. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the
southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause
the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly
winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring_Forties,
between 40 and 50 degrees_latitude_south of the equator.[39] The Westerlies
play an important role in carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the
western coasts of continents,[40][41] especially in the southern hemisphere
because of its vast oceanic expanse.
**** Polar easterlies[edit] ****
Main article: Polar_easterlies
The polar easterlies, also known as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold
prevailing winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar_highs at
the north and south_poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies
at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the
east to the west, and are often weak and irregular.[42] Because of the low sun
angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-
pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air;[43] that outflow is
deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.
***** Local considerations[edit] *****
Local winds around the world. These winds are formed through the heating of
land (from mountains or flat terrain)
**** Sea and land breezes[edit] ****
Main article: Sea_breeze
A: Sea breeze (occurs at daytime), B: Land breeze (occurs at night)
In coastal regions, sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a
location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because
of water's greater specific_heat compared to land.[44] As the temperature of
the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction.
The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises.
This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars from the ocean to the
land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea_level_pressure, flows
inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When
large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly
proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea.
If an offshore wind of 8 knots (15 km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely
to develop.
At night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences
in their specific_heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea
breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature
offshore, the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land,
establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to
oppose it.[45]
**** Near mountains[edit] ****
Mountain wave schematic. The wind flows towards a mountain and produces a first
oscillation (A). A second wave occurs further away and higher. The lenticular
clouds form at the peak of the waves (B).
Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the
surrounding air at the same altitude above sea_level, creating an associated
thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have
otherwise existed,[46][47] and changing the wind circulation of the region. In
areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the
environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys is
the most important contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys
substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere
and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind
parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a
barrier_jet. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%.[48] Wind
direction also changes because of the contour of the land.[49]
If there is a pass in the mountain range, winds will rush through the pass with
considerable speed because of the Bernoulli_principle that describes an inverse
relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and
erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These
conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes.[49] Cool winds
accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names. In Central
America, examples include the Papagayo_wind, the Panama wind, and the Tehuano
wind. In Europe, similar winds are known as the Bora, Tramontane, and Mistral.
When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper
layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface,
which leads to increased marine life.[50]
In mountainous areas, local distortion of the airflow becomes severe. Jagged
terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as
rotors, which can be topped by lenticular_clouds. Strong updrafts, downdrafts
and eddies develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Orographic
precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the
rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge,
also known as upslope flow, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In
mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for
example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the
windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is
removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air on the descending and generally
warming, leeward side where a rain_shadow is observed.[51] Winds that flow over
mountains down into lower elevations are known as downslope winds. These winds
are warm and dry. In Europe downwind of the Alps, they are known as foehn. In
Poland, an example is the halny wiatr. In Argentina, the local name for
downsloped winds is zonda. In Java, the local name for such winds is koembang.
In New Zealand, they are known as the Nor'west_arch, and are accompanied by the
cloud formation they are named after that has inspired artwork over the years.
[52] In the Great Plains of the United States, these winds are known as a
chinook. Downslope winds also occur in the foothills of the Appalachian
mountains of the United States,[53] and they can be as strong as other
downslope winds [54] and unusual compared to other foehn_winds in that the
relative humidity typically changes little due to the increased moisture in the
source air mass.[55] In California, downslope winds are funneled through
mountain passes, which intensify their effect, and examples include the Santa
Ana and sundowner winds. Wind speeds during downslope wind effect can exceed
160 kilometers per hour (99 mph).[56]
***** Average wind speeds[edit] *****
Main article: Wind_atlas
As described earlier, prevailing and local winds are not spread evenly across
the earth, which means that wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the
wind speed also increases with the altitude.
**** Wind power density[edit] ****
Nowadays, a yardstick used to determine the best locations for wind energy
development is referred to as wind power density (WPD). It is a calculation
relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location,
frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period
of time. It takes into account wind velocity and mass. Color coded maps are
prepared for a particular area are described as, for example, "mean annual
power density at 50 meters". The results of the above calculation are included
in an index developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab and referred to as
"NREL CLASS". The larger the WPD calculation, the higher it is rated by class.
[57] At the end of 2008, worldwide nameplate_capacity of wind-powered
generators was 120.8 gigawatts.[58] Although wind produced only about 1.5% of
worldwide electricity use in 2009,[58] it is growing rapidly, having doubled in
the three years between 2005 and 2008. In several countries it has achieved
relatively high levels of penetration, accounting for approximately 19% of
electricity production in Denmark, 10% in Spain and Portugal, and 7% in Germany
and the Republic_of_Ireland in 2008. One study indicates that an entirely
renewable energy supply based on 70% wind is attainable at today's power prices
by linking wind_farms with an HVDC supergrid.[59]Wind_power has expanded
quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%.
[60] In 2011 wind energy was also used to power the longest journey in a wind
powered car which travelled a distance of 5,000 km (3,100 miles) from Perth to
Melbourne in Australia.[61]
***** Shear[edit] *****
Hodograph plot of wind vectors at various heights in the troposphere, which is
used to diagnose vertical wind_shear
Main article: Wind_shear
Wind shear, sometimes referred to as wind_gradient, is a difference in wind
speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere.
[62] Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components,
with horizontal wind shear seen across weather_fronts and near the coast,[63]
and vertical shear typically near the surface,[64] though also at higher levels
in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.[65]
Wind shear itself is a microscale_meteorological phenomenon occurring over a
very small distance, but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic_scale
weather features such as squall_lines and cold_fronts. It is commonly observed
near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms,[66] weather fronts,
areas of locally higher low level winds referred to as low level jets, near
mountains,[67] radiation inversions that occur because of clear skies and calm
winds, buildings,[68] wind_turbines,[69] and sailboats.[70] Wind shear has a
significant effect on the control of aircraft during take-off and landing,[71]
and was a significant cause of aircraft accidents involving large loss of life
within the United States.[66]
Sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear, which can bend
the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or
vice versa.[72] Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits
tropical_cyclone development,[73] but helps to organize individual
thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe
weather.[74] The thermal_wind concept explains how differences in wind speed
with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains
the existence of the jet_stream.[75]
***** Usage[edit] *****
**** History[edit] ****
Winds according to Aristotle.
As a natural force, the wind was often personified as one or more wind_gods or
as an expression of the supernatural in many cultures. Vayu is the Hindu God of
Wind.[76][77] The Greek wind gods include Boreas, Notus, Eurus, and Zephyrus.
[77] Aeolus, in varying interpretations the ruler or keeper of the four winds,
has also been described as Astraeus, the god of dusk who fathered the four
winds with Eos, goddess of dawn. The ancient_Greeks also observed the seasonal
change of the winds, as evidenced by the Tower_of_the_Winds in Athens.[77]
Venti are the Roman gods of the winds.[78] FÅ«jin is the Japanese wind god and
is one of the eldest Shinto gods. According to legend, he was present at the
creation of the world and first let the winds out of his bag to clear the world
of mist.[79] In Norse_mythology, NjÃ¶rÃ°r is the god of the wind.[77] There are
also four dvÃ¤rgar (Norse_dwarves), named NorÃ°ri,_SuÃ°ri,_Austri_and_Vestri,
and probably the four_stags_of_Yggdrasil, personify the four winds, and
parallel the four Greek wind gods.[80] Stribog is the name of the Slavic_god of
winds, sky and air. He is said to be the ancestor (grandfather) of the winds of
the eight directions.[77]
Kamikaze (ç¥é¢¨) is a Japanese word, usually translated as divine wind,
believed to be a gift from the gods. The term is first known to have been used
as the name of a pair or series of typhoons that are said to have saved Japan
from two Mongol fleets under Kublai Khan that attacked Japan in 1274 and again
in 1281.[81] Protestant_Wind is a name for the storm that deterred the Spanish
Armada from an invasion of England in 1588 where the wind played a pivotal
role,[82] or the favorable winds that enabled William_of_Orange to invade
England in 1688.[83] During Napoleon's Egyptian_Campaign, the French soldiers
had a hard time with the khamsin wind: when the storm appeared "as a blood-
stint in the distant sky", the natives went to take cover, while the French
"did not react until it was too late, then choked and fainted in the blinding,
suffocating walls of dust".[84] During the North_African_Campaign of the World
War II, "allied and German troops were several times forced to halt in mid-
battle because of sandstorms caused by khamsin ... Grains of sand whirled by
the wind blinded the soldiers and created electrical disturbances that rendered
compasses useless."[85]
**** Transportation[edit] ****

allow aircraft to take off and land into the wind
There are many different forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain
basic things in common. Except for rotor_ships using the Magnus_effect, every
sailing ship has a hull, rigging and at least one mast to hold up the sails
that use the wind to power the ship.[86] Ocean journeys by sailing ship can
take many months,[87] and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack
of wind,[88] or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not
allow progress in the desired direction.[89] A severe storm could lead to
shipwreck, and the loss of all hands.[90] Sailing ships can only carry a
certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages
carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.[91]
For aerodynamic aircraft which operate relative to the air, winds affect
groundspeed,[92] and in the case of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a
significant or solitary role in their movement and ground_track.[93] The
velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the
direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned
to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off
with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is
generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and
decreases the climb gradient.[94]
**** Power source[edit] ****
This wind_turbine generates electricity from wind power.
See also: Wind_power and High-altitude_wind_power
Historically, the ancient Sinhalese of Anuradhapura and in other cities around
Sri_Lanka used the monsoon winds to power furnaces as early as 300 BCE.[95] The
furnaces were constructed on the path of the monsoon winds to exploit the wind
power, to bring the temperatures inside up to 1,200 Â°C (2,190 Â°F). A
rudimentary windmill was used to power an organ in the first century CE.[96]
The first practical windmills were later built in Sistan, Afghanistan, from the
7th century CE. These were vertical-axle windmills, which had long vertical
driveshafts with rectangle shaped blades.[97] Made of six to twelve sails
covered in reed_matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind
corn and draw up water, and were used in the gristmilling and sugarcane
industries.[98] Horizontal-axle windmills were later used extensively in
Northwestern Europe to grind flour beginning in the 1180s, and many Dutch
windmills still exist. High_altitude_wind_power is the focus of over 30
companies worldwide using tethered technology rather than ground-hugging
compressive-towers.[99] Oil is being saved by using wind for powering cargo
ships by use of the mechanical energy converted from the wind's kinetic energy
using very large kites.[100]
**** Recreation[edit] ****
Otto_Lilienthal in flight
Wind figures prominently in several popular sports, including recreational hang
gliding, hot_air_ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite_landboarding, kite
surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients just
above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider.
Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground_launches, also known as
winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden,
or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated
airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed.
The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient.
[101] When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds
are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach
to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is
insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must
anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for
it.[102]
***** Role in the natural world[edit] *****
In arid climates, the main source of erosion is wind.[103] The general wind
circulation moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands
of kilometers downwind of their point of origin,[104] which is known as
deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement
of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very
important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of
seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed
dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the
biomass of land plants.
**** Erosion[edit] ****
A rock formation in the Altiplano, Bolivia, sculpted by wind erosion
See also: Aeolian_processes
Erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. There are two main
effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to
another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may
impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession).
Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in
areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is
the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert.[105] Loess is a
homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often
calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian)
sediment.[106] It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers
areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often
stands in either steep or vertical faces.[107] Loess tends to develop into
highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are
among the most agriculturally productive in the world.[108] Loess deposits are
geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore,
windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to
reduce the wind erosion of loess.[103]
**** Desert dust migration[edit] ****
During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade
winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from
the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving
around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves
over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white
appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively
impacts air_quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates.[109] Over
50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida.[110]
Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in
Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and
Florida from year to year.[111] Dust events have been linked to a decline in
the health of coral_reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the
1970s.[112] Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi_Desert, which combined
with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North
America.[104]
There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The
Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary_islands.[113] The
Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf_of_Guinea.[114] The
Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the
movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean.[115] Spring storm
systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across
Egypt and the Arabian_peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin.[116] The
Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a
time across the Persian_Gulf states.[117]
**** Effect on plants[edit] ****
Tumbleweed blown against a fence
In the montane_forest of Olympic_National_Park, windthrow opens the canopy and
increases light intensity on the understory.
See also: Seed_dispersal
Wind dispersal of seeds, or anemochory, is one of the more primitive means of
dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float
on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground.[118] The
classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum
spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can
be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer_(genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which
have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind
dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood
of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong
evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in
the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e.,
larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the
mainland.[119] Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or
ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A
related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen
is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner,
which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced
closely together.[120]
Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and isolated mountains, the tree line
is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more
complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds
scour away thin soils through erosion,[121] as well as damage limbs and twigs.
When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow.
This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases
generally occurring to tree_stands that are 75 years or older.[122] Plant
varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka_spruce and sea_grape,[123] are
pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.[124]
Wind can also cause plants damage through sand_abrasion. Strong winds will pick
up loose sand and topsoil and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from 25
miles per hour (40 km/h) to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h). Such windblown sand
causes extensive damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells,
making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought. Using a mechanical
sandblaster in a laboratory setting, scientists affiliated with the
Agricultural_Research_Service studied the effects of windblown sand abrasion on
cotton seedlings. The study showed that the seedlings responded to the damage
created by the windblown sand abrasion by shifting energy from stem and root
growth to the growth and repair of the damaged stems.[125] After a period of
four weeks the growth of the seedling once again became uniform throughout the
plant, as it was before the windblown sand abrasion occurred.[126]
**** Effect on animals[edit] ****
Cattle and sheep are prone to wind_chill caused by a combination of wind and
cold temperatures, when winds exceed 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph), rendering
their hair and wool coverings ineffective.[127] Although penguins use both a
layer of fat and feathers to help guard against coldness in both water and air,
their flippers and feet are less immune to the cold. In the coldest climates
such as Antarctica, emperor_penguins use huddling behavior to survive the wind
and cold, continuously alternating the members on the outside of the assembled
group, which reduces heat loss by 50%.[128] Flying insects, a subset of
arthropods, are swept along by the prevailing winds,[129] while birds follow
their own course taking advantage of wind conditions, in order to either fly or
glide.[130] As such, fine line patterns within weather_radar imagery,
associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns.[131] Bird
migration, which tends to occur overnight within the lowest 7,000 feet
(2,100 m) of the Earth's_atmosphere, contaminates wind profiles gathered by
weather radar, particularly the WSR-88D, by increasing the environmental wind
returns by 15 knots (28 km/h) to 30 knots (56 km/h).[132]
Pikas use a wall of pebbles to store dry plants and grasses for the winter in
order to protect the food from being blown away.[133] Cockroaches use slight
winds that precede the attacks of potential predators, such as toads, to
survive their encounters. Their cerci are very sensitive to the wind, and help
them survive half of their attacks.[134] Elk have a keen sense of smell that
can detect potential upwind predators at a distance of 0.5 miles (800 m).[135]
Increases in wind above 15 kilometers per hour (9.3 mph) signals glaucous_gulls
to increase their foraging and aerial attacks on thick-billed murres.[136]
**** Sound generation[edit] ****
Wind causes the generation of sound. The movement of air causes movements of
parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce
sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause a low level of
environmental_noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling
sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over
cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object.[137]
Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying
noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies,
ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.
***** Related damage[edit] *****

Damage from Hurricane_Andrew
High winds are known to cause damage, depending upon the magnitude of their
velocity and pressure differential. Wind pressures are positive on the windward
side of a structure and negative on the leeward side.[138] Infrequent wind
gusts can cause poorly designed suspension_bridges to sway. When wind gusts are
at a similar frequency to the swaying of the bridge, the bridge can be
destroyed more easily, such as what occurred with the Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge in
1940.[139] Wind speeds as low as 23 knots (43 km/h) can lead to power outages
due to tree branches disrupting the flow of energy through power lines.[140]
While no species of tree is guaranteed to stand up to hurricane-force winds,
those with shallow roots are more prone to uproot, and brittle trees such as
eucalyptus, sea hibiscus, and avocado are more prone to damage.[141] Hurricane-
force winds cause substantial damage to mobile homes, and begin to structurally
damage homes with foundations. Winds of this strength due to downsloped winds
off terrain have been known to shatter windows and sandblast paint from cars.
[56] Once winds exceed 135 knots (250 km/h), homes completely collapse, and
significant damage is done to larger buildings. Total destruction to man-made
structures occurs when winds reach 175 knots (324 km/h). The SaffirâSimpson
scale and Enhanced_Fujita_scale were designed to help estimate wind speed from
the damage caused by high winds related to tropical cyclones and tornadoes, and
vice versa.[142][143]
Australia's Barrow_Island holds the record for the strongest wind gust,
reaching 408 km/h (253 mph) during tropical cyclone Olivia on 10 April 1996,
surpassing the previous record of 372 km/h (231 mph) set on Mount_Washington_
(New_Hampshire) on the afternoon of 12 April 1934.[144] The most powerful gusts
of wind on Earth were created by nuclear detonations. The blast wave is similar
to a strong wind gust over the ground. The largest nuclear explosion (50â58
megatons at an altitude of about 13,000 feet (4,000 m)) generated a 20 bar
blast pressure at ground zero, which is similar to a wind gust of 3,100 miles
per hour (5,000 km/h).
Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of
smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower
humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds.[145] Sunlight
warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and
downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these
winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys.[146]
United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins
at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from
the daytime warmth.[147]
***** In outer space[edit] *****
Main article: Stellar_wind
The solar wind is quite different from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin
is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's
atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the planetary_wind is composed of light
gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the
planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.
The fastest wind ever recorded is coming from the accretion_disc of the IGR
J17091-3624 black hole. Its speed is 20,000,000 miles per hour (32,000,000 km/
h), which is 3% of the speed_of_light.[148]
**** Planetary wind[edit] ****
Main article: Atmospheric_escape
Possible future for Earth due to the planetary wind: Venus
The hydrodynamic wind within the upper portion of a planet's atmosphere allows
light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower
limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape_velocity,
entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas
loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind.[149] Such a process
over geologic_time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into
planets like Venus.[150] Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres
could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.[151]
**** Solar wind[edit] ****
Main article: Solar_wind
Rather than air, the solar wind is a stream_of_charged_particlesâa
plasmaâejected from the upper_atmosphere of the sun at a rate of 400
kilometers per second (890,000 mph). It consists mostly of electrons and
protons with energies of about 1 keV. The stream of particles varies in
temperature and speed with the passage of time. These particles are able to
escape the sun's gravity, in part because of the high temperature of the
corona,[152] but also because of high kinetic_energy that particles gain
through a process that is not well understood. The solar wind creates the
Heliosphere, a vast bubble in the interstellar_medium surrounding the Solar
System.[153] Planets require large magnetic fields in order to reduce the
ionization of their upper atmosphere by the solar wind.[151] Other phenomena
caused by the solar wind include geomagnetic_storms that can knock out power
grids on Earth,[154] the aurorae such as the Northern_Lights,[155] and the
plasma tails of comets that always point away from the sun.[156]
***** On other planets[edit] *****
Strong 300 kilometers per hour (190 mph) winds at Venus's cloud tops circle the
planet every four to five earth days.[157] When the poles of Mars are exposed
to sunlight after their winter, the frozen CO2 sublimates, creating significant
winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400 kilometers per hour (250 mph),
which subsequently transports large amounts of dust and water vapor over its
landscape.[158] Other Martian winds have resulted in cleaning_events and dust
devils.[159][160] On Jupiter, wind speeds of 100 meters per second (220 mph)
are common in zonal jet streams.[161] Saturn's winds are among the Solar
System's fastest. CassiniâHuygens data indicated peak easterly winds of 375
meters per second (840 mph).[162] On Uranus, northern hemisphere wind speeds
reach as high as 240 meters per second (540 mph) near 50 degrees north
latitude.[163][164][165] At the cloud tops of Neptune, prevailing winds range
in speed from 400 meters per second (890 mph) along the equator to 250 meters
per second (560 mph) at the poles.[166] At 70Â° S latitude on Neptune, a high-
speed jet stream travels at a speed of 300 meters per second (670 mph).[167]
The fastest wind on any known planet is on HD_80606_b located 190 light_years
away, where it blows at more than 11,000 mph or 5 km/s.[168]
