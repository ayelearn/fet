From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Lubrication of a ship's steam_engine crankshaft. The two bottles of lubricant
are attached to the piston and move while the engine is operating.
Lubrication is the process or technique of using a lubricant to reduce friction
and/or wear in a contact between two surfaces. The study of lubrication is a
discipline in the field of tribology.
Lubricants can be solids (such as Molybdenum_disulfide MoS2),[1] solid/liquid
dispersions (such as grease), liquids (such as oil or water), liquid-liquid
dispersions[citation_needed] or gases.
Fluid-lubricated systems are designed so that the applied load is partially or
completely carried by hydrodynamic or hydrostatic pressure, which reduces solid
body interactions (and consequently friction and wear). Depending on the degree
of surface separation, different lubrication regimes can be distinguished.
Adequate lubrication allows smooth, continuous operation of machine_elements,
reduces the rate of wear, and prevents excessive stresses or seizures at
bearings. When lubrication breaks down, components can rub destructively
against each other, causing heat, local welding, destructive damage and
failure.

***** Lubrication Mechanisms[edit] *****
**** Fluid-lubricated Systems[edit] ****
As the load increases on the contacting surfaces, three distinct situations can
be observed with respect to the mode of lubrication, which are called
lubrication regimes:[citation_needed]
    * Fluid film lubrication is the lubrication regime in which, through
      viscous forces, the load is fully supported by the lubricant within the
      space or gap between the parts in motion relative to one another object
      (the lubricated conjunction) and solidâsolid contact is avoided.[2]
          o In hydrostatic lubrication, external pressure is applied to the
            lubricant in the bearing to maintain the fluid lubricant film where
            it would otherwise be squeezed out.
          o In hydrodynamic lubrication the motion of the contacting surfaces
            as well as the design of the bearing pump lubricant around the
            bearing to maintain the lubricating film. This design of bearing
            may wear when started, stopped or reversed, as the lubricant film
            breaks down. The basis of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication is
            the Reynolds_equation. The governing equations of the hydrodynamic
            theory of lubrication and some analytical solutions can be found in
            the reference.[3]
    * Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming surfaces or
      higher load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact.
      Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost
      parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic
      lubrication, the motion of the contacting bodies generates a flow induced
      pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such
      high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably.
      At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film
      completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features,
      or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary
      lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic
      theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime
      elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the
      lubricant film thickness.[4][5]
    * Boundary lubrication (also called boundary film lubrication): The
      hydrodynamic effects are negligible. The bodies come into closer contact
      at their asperities; the heat developed by the local pressures causes a
      condition which is called stick-slip, and some asperities break off. At
      the elevated temperature and pressure conditions, chemically reactive
      constituents of the lubricant react with the contact surface, forming a
      highly resistant tenacious layer or film on the moving solid surfaces
      (boundary film) which is capable of supporting the load and major wear or
      breakdown is avoided. Boundary lubrication is also defined as that regime
      in which the load is carried by the surface asperities rather than by the
      lubricant.[6]
    * Mixed lubrication: This regime is in between the full film
      elastohydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regimes. The generated
      lubricant film is not enough to separate the bodies completely, but
      hydrodynamic effects are considerable.[7]
Besides supporting the load the lubricant may have to perform other functions
as well, for instance it may cool the contact areas and remove wear products.
While carrying out these functions the lubricant is constantly replaced from
the contact areas either by the relative movement (hydrodynamics) or by
externally induced forces.
Lubrication is required for correct operation of mechanical systems such as
pistons, pumps, cams, bearings, turbines, cutting_tools etc. where without
lubrication the pressure between the surfaces in close proximity would generate
enough heat for rapid surface damage which in a coarsened condition may
literally weld the surfaces together, causing seizure.
In some applications, such as piston engines, the film between the piston and
the cylinder wall also seals the combustion chamber, preventing combustion
gases from escaping into the crankcase.
