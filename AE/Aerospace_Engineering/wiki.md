Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the
development of aircraft and spacecraft.[3] It has two major and overlapping
branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Avionics
engineering is similar, but deals with the electronics side of aerospace
engineering.
Aeronautical_engineering was the original term for the field. As flight
technology advanced to include craft operating in outer_space (astronautics),
the broader term "aerospace engineering" has come into common use.[4] Aerospace
engineering, particularly the astronautics branch is often colloquially
referred to as "rocket science".[5]

***** Overview[edit] *****
Flight vehicles are subjected to demanding conditions such as those caused by
changes in atmospheric_pressure and temperature, with structural_loads applied
upon vehicle components. Consequently, they are usually the products of various
technological and engineering_disciplines including aerodynamics, propulsion,
avionics, materials_science, structural_analysis and manufacturing. The
interaction between these technologies is known as aerospace engineering.
Because of the complexity and number of disciplines involved, aerospace
engineering is carried out by teams of engineers, each having their own
specialized area of expertise.[6]
***** History[edit] *****
See also: History_of_aviation
Orville_and_Wilbur_Wright flew the Wright_Flyer in 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina.
The origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers
around the late 19th to early 20th centuries, although the work of Sir George
Cayley dates from the last decade of the 18th to mid-19th century. One of the
most important people in the history of aeronautics,[7] Cayley was a pioneer in
aeronautical engineering[8] and is credited as the first person to separate the
forces of lift and drag, which are in effect on any flight vehicle.[9]
Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some
concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.[10] Scientists
understood some key elements of aerospace engineering, like fluid_dynamics, in
the 18th century. Many years later after the successful flights by the Wright
brothers, the 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through the
design of World_War_I military aircraft.
Between World Wars I and II, great leaps were made in Aeronautical Engineering.
The advent of mainstream civil aviation greatly accelerated this process.
Notable airplanes of this era include the Curtiss_JN_4, the Farman_F.60
Goliath, and Fokker_trimotor. Notable military airplanes of this period include
the Mitsubishi_A6M_Zero, the Supermarine_Spitfire and the Messerschmitt_Bf_109
from Japan, Great Britain, and Germany respectively. A significant development
in Aerospace engineering came with the first operational Jet_engine-powered
airplane, the Messerschmitt_Me_262 which entered service in 1944 towards the
end of the second World War.
The first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in February 1958.[4] The
definition considered the Earth's atmosphere and the outer space as a single
realm, thereby encompassing both aircraft (aero) and spacecraft (space) under a
newly coined word aerospace. In response to the USSR launching the first
satellite, Sputnik into space on October 4, 1957, U.S. aerospace engineers
launched the first_American_satellite on January 31, 1958. The National
Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration was founded in 1958 as a response to the
Cold War. In 1969, Apollo_11, the first manned space mission to the moon took
place. It saw three astronauts enter orbit around the Moon, with two, Neil
Armstrong and Buzz_Aldrin, visiting the lunar surface. The third astronaut,
Michael_Collins, stayed in orbit to rendezvous with Armstrong and Aldrin after
their visit to the lunar surface. [11]

See also: List_of_aerospace_engineering_topics
Some of the elements of aerospace engineering are:[12][13]
A fighter jet engine undergoing testing. The tunnel behind the engine allows
noise and exhaust to escape.
    * Radar_cross-section â the study of vehicle signature apparent to Radar
      remote_sensing.
    * Fluid_mechanics â the study of fluid_flow around objects. Specifically
      aerodynamics concerning the flow of air over bodies such as wings or
      through objects such as wind_tunnels (see also lift and aeronautics).
    * Astrodynamics â the study of orbital_mechanics including prediction of
      orbital elements when given a select few variables. While few schools in
      the United States teach this at the undergraduate level, several have
      graduate programs covering this topic (usually in conjunction with the
      Physics department of said college or university).
    * Statics and Dynamics (engineering mechanics) â the study of movement,
      forces, moments in mechanical systems.
    * Mathematics â in particular, calculus, differential_equations, and
      linear_algebra.
    * Electrotechnology â the study of electronics within engineering.
    * Propulsion â the energy to move a vehicle through the air (or in outer
      space) is provided by internal_combustion_engines, jet_engines and
      turbomachinery, or rockets (see also propeller and spacecraft
      propulsion). A more recent addition to this module is electric_propulsion
      and ion_propulsion.
    * Control_engineering â the study of mathematical_modeling of the dynamic
      behavior of systems and designing them, usually using feedback signals,
      so that their dynamic behavior is desirable (stable, without large
      excursions, with minimum error). This applies to the dynamic behavior of
      aircraft, spacecraft, propulsion systems, and subsystems that exist on
      aerospace vehicles.
    * Aircraft_structures â design of the physical configuration of the craft
      to withstand the forces encountered during flight. Aerospace engineering
      aims to keep structures lightweight and low-cost while maintaining
      structural integrity.[14]
    * Materials_science â related to structures, aerospace engineering also
      studies the materials of which the aerospace structures are to be built.
      New materials with very specific properties are invented, or existing
      ones are modified to improve their performance.
    * Solid_mechanics â Closely related to material science is solid
      mechanics which deals with stress and strain analysis of the components
      of the vehicle. Nowadays there are several Finite Element programs such
      as MSC Patran/Nastran which aid engineers in the analytical process.
    * Aeroelasticity â the interaction of aerodynamic forces and structural
      flexibility, potentially causing flutter, divergence, etc.
    * Avionics â the design and programming of computer_systems on board an
      aircraft or spacecraft and the simulation of systems.
    * Software â the specification, design, development, test, and
      implementation of computer_software for aerospace applications, including
      flight_software, ground_control_software, test & evaluation software,
      etc.
    * Risk_and_reliability â the study of risk and reliability assessment
      techniques and the mathematics involved in the quantitative methods.
    * Noise_control â the study of the mechanics of sound transfer.
    * Aeroacoustics â the study of noise generation via either turbulent
      fluid motion or aerodynamic forces interacting with surfaces.
    * Flight_test â designing and executing flight test programs in order to
      gather and analyze performance and handling_qualities data in order to
      determine if an aircraft meets its design and performance goals and
      certification requirements.
The basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical physics, such as fluid
dynamics for aerodynamics or the equations_of_motion for flight_dynamics. There
is also a large empirical component. Historically, this empirical component was
derived from testing of scale models and prototypes, either in wind_tunnels or
in the free atmosphere. More recently, advances in computing have enabled the
use of computational_fluid_dynamics to simulate the behavior of the fluid,
reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing. Those studying
hydrodynamics or Hydroacoustics often obtained degrees in Aerospace
Engineering.
Additionally, aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components
that constitute an aerospace vehicle (subsystems including power, aerospace
bearings, communications, thermal_control, life_support, etc.) and its life
cycle (design, temperature, pressure, radiation, velocity, lifetime).
***** Degree programs[edit] *****
Main article: List_of_aerospace_engineering_schools
Aerospace engineering may be studied at the advanced_diploma, bachelor's,
master's, and Ph.D. levels in aerospace engineering departments at many
universities, and in mechanical_engineering departments at others. A few
departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering. Some
institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering.
Graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace
industry.
A background in chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics is
important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree.[15]
***** In popular culture[edit] *****
The term "rocket_scientist" is sometimes used to describe a person of great
intelligence since rocket science is seen as a practice requiring great mental
ability, especially technically and mathematically. The term is used ironically
in the expression "It's not rocket science" to indicate that a task is simple.
[16] Strictly speaking, the use of "science" in "rocket science" is a misnomer
since science is about understanding the origins, nature, and behavior of the
universe; engineering is about using scientific and engineering principles to
solve problems and develop new technology.[5][17] However, "science" and
"engineering" are often misused as synonyms.[5][17][18]
