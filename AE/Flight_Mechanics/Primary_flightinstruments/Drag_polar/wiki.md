The drag polar is the relationship between the lift on an aircraft and its
drag, expressed in terms of the dependence of the drag coefficient on the lift
coefficient. It may be described by an equation or displayed in a diagram
called a polar plot.[1]

***** The drag polar[edit] *****
Drag and lift coefficients for NACA 633618 airfoil. Full curves are lift,
dashed drag; red curves have Re = 9Â·106, blue 3Â·106.
Drag polar for the NACA 633618 airfoil, colour-coded as opposite plot.
The significant aerodynamic properties of aircraft wings are summarised by two
dimensionless_quantities, the lift and drag_coefficients CL and CD. Like other
such aerodynamic quantities, they are functions only of the angle_of_attack Î±,
the Reynolds_number Re and the Mach_number M. CL and CD are often presented
individually, plotted against Î±, but an alternative graph plots CL as a
function of CD, using Î± parametrically.[2][3] Similar plots can be made for
other components or for whole aircraft; in all cases they are referred to as
drag polars. The drag polar of an aircraft contains almost all the information
required to analyse its performance and hence to begin a design.[2]
Since the lift and the drag forces, L and D are scaled by the same factor to
get CL and CD, L/D = CL/CD. As L and D are at right angles, the latter parallel
to the free_stream_velocity or relative velocity of the surrounding, distant,
air, the resultant force R lies at the same angle to that direction as the line
from the origin of the polar plot to the corresponding CL, CD point does to the
CD axis. If, in a wind_tunnel or whirling_arm system an aerodynamic surface is
held at a fixed angle of attack and both the magnitude and direction of the
resulting force measured, they can be plotted using polar_coordinates. When
this measurement is repeated at different angles of attack the drag polar is
obtained. Lift and drag data was gathered in this way in the 1880s by Otto
Lilienthal and around 1910 by Gustav_Eiffel, though not presented in terms of
the more recent coefficients. Eiffel was the first to use the name drag polar.
[2]
Because of the Reynolds and Mach number dependence of the coefficients,
families of drag polars may be plotted together. The design of a fighter will
involve a set at different Mach numbers, whereas gliders, which spend their
time either flying slowly in thermals or rapidly between them may require
polars at different Reynolds numbers but are unaffected by compressibility
effects. During the evolution of the design the drag polar will be refined. A
particular aircraft may have different polar plots even at the same Re and M
values, depending for example on whether undercarriage and flaps are deployed.

Drag polar for light aircraft. CD0= 0.017, K = 0.075 and CL0 = 0.1. The tangent
gives the maximum L/D point.
The accompanying diagram shows a drag polar for a typical light_aircraft. Such
diagrams identify a minimum CD point at the left-most point on the plot, where
the drag is locally independent of lift; to the right, the drag is lift
related. One component here is the induced_drag of the wing, an unavoidable
companion of the wing's lift, though one that can be reduced by increasing the
aspect_ratio. Prandtl's lifting line theoretical work shows that this increases
as CL2. The other drag mechanisms, parasitic and wave_drag, have both constant
components, totalling CD0 say, and CL dependent contributions that are often
assumed to increase as CL2. If so, then
                                                            CD = CD0 + K.(CL -
                                                            CL0)2.
The effect of CL0 is to lift the polar curve upwards; physically this is caused
by some vertical asymmetry, such as a cambered wing or a finite angle_of
incidence, which ensures the minimum drag attitude produces lift and increases
the maximum lift to drag ratio.[2][4]
***** Power required plots[edit] *****
One example of the way the polar is used in the design process is the
calculation of the power required (PR) curve, which plots the power needed for
steady, level flight over the operating speed range. The forces involved are
obtained from the coefficients by multiplication with (Ï/2).S V2, where Ï is
the density_of_the_atmosphere at the flight altitude, S is the wing area and V
is the speed. In level flight, lift equals weight W and thrust equals drag, so
PR curve for the light aircraft with the drag polar above and weighing 2000 kg,
with a wing area of 15 mÂ² and a propeller efficiency of 0.8.
                                                            W = (Ï/2).S.V2.CL
                                                            and
                                                            PR = (Ï/
                                                            2Î·).S.V3.CD.
The extra factor of V/Î·, with Î· the propeller_efficiency, in the second
equation enters because PR= (required thrust)ÃV/Î·. Power rather than thrust
is appropriate for a propeller driven aircraft, since it is roughly independent
of speed; jet engines produce constant thrust. Since the weight is constant,
the first of these equations determines how CL falls with increasing speed.
Putting these CL values into the second equation with CD from the drag polar
produces the power curve. The low speed region shows a fall in lift induced
drag, through a minimum followed by an increase in profile drag at higher
speeds. The minimum power required, at a speed of 195 km/h  (121 mph) is about
86 kW (115 hp); 135 kW (181 hp) is required for a maximum speed of 300 km/h
(186 mph). Flight at the power minimum will provide maximum endurance; the
speed for greatest range is where the tangent to the power curve passes through
the origin, about 240 km/h (150 mph).[5])
If an analytical expression for the polar is available, useful relationships
can be developed by differentiation. For example the form above, simplified
slightly by putting CL0 = 0, has a maximum CL/CD at CL2 = CD0/K. For a
propeller aircraft this is the maximum endurance condition and gives a speed of
185 km/h (115 mph). The corresponding maximum range condition is the maximum of
CL3/2/CD, at CL2 = 3.CD0/K, and so the optimum speed is 244 km/h (152 mph). The
effects of the approximation CL0 = 0 are less than 5%; of course, with a finite
CL0 = 0.1, the analytic and graphical methods give the same results.[5]
***** Rate of climb[edit] *****
For an aircraft to climb at an angle Î¸ and at speed V its engine must be
developing more power, P say, than that PR required to balance the drag
experienced at that speed in level flight and shown on the power required plot.
In level flight PR/V = D but in the climb there is the additional weight
component to include, that is
                                                            P/V = D + W.sin Î¸
                                                            = PR/V + W.sin Î¸.
Hence the climb rate RC = V.sin Î¸ = (P - PR)/W.[6] Supposing the 135 kW engine
required for a maximum speed at 300 km/h is fitted, the maximum excess power is
135 - 87 = 48 Kw at the minimum of PR and the rate of climb 2.4 m/s. This
suggests a more powerful engine is called for.
***** Glider polars[edit] *****
Main article: Polar_curve_(aviation)
The same aircraft, without power. The tangent defines the minimum glide angle.
Without power, a gliding aircraft has only gravity to propel it. At a glide
angle of Î¸, the weight has two components, W.cos Î¸ at right angles to the
flight line and W.sin Î¸ parallel to it. These are balanced by the force and
lift components respectively, so
                                                            W.cos Î¸ = (Ï/
                                                            2).S.V2.CL and
                                                            W. sin Î¸ = (Ï/
                                                            2).S.V2.CD.
Dividing one equation by the other shows that the glide angle is given by tan
Î¸ = CD/CL. The performance characteristics of most interest in unpowered
flight are the speed across the ground, Vg say, and the sink speed Vs; these
are displayed by plotting V.sin Î¸ = Vs against V.cos Î¸ = Vg. Such plots are
generally termed polars, and to produce them the glide angle as a function of V
is required.[7]
One way of finding solutions to the two force equations is to square them both
then add together; this shows the possible CL, CD values lie on a circle of
radius 2.W / S.Ï.V2. When this is plotted on the drag polar, the intersection
of the two curves locates the solution and its Î¸ value read off.
Alternatively, bearing in mind that glides are usually shallow, the
approximation cos Î¸ â 1, good for Î¸ less than 10Â°, can be used in the lift
equation and the value of CL for a chosen V calculated, finding CL from the
drag polar and then calculating Î¸.[7]
The example polar here shows the gliding performance of the aircraft analysed
above, assuming its drag polar is not much altered by the stationary propeller.
A straight line from the origin to some point on the curve has a gradient equal
to the glide angle at that speed, so the corresponding tangent shows the best
glide angle tanâ1(CD/CL)min â 3.3Â°. This is not the lowest rate of sink
but provides the greatest range, requiring a speed of 240  km/h (149 mph); the
minimum sink rate of about 3.5 m/s is at 180 km/h (112 mph), speeds seen in the
previous, powered plots.[7]
