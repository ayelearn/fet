From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Aircraft can have different ways to take off and land. Conventional airplanes
accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and
reverse the process to land. Some airplanes can take off at low speed, this
being a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier_Jump_Jets
can take_off_and_land_vertically. Rockets also usually take off vertically, but
some designs can land horizontally.

*** Conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL)[edit] ***
Main article: CTOL
** Takeoff[edit] **
Main article: Takeoff
Takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aircraft goes through a transition
from moving along the ground (taxiing) to flying in the air, usually starting
on a runway. For balloons, helicopters and some specialized fixed-wing aircraft
(VTOL aircraft such as the Harrier), no runway is needed. Takeoff is the
opposite of landing.

Landing is the last part of a flight, where a flying aircraft or spacecraft (or
animals) returns to the ground. When the flying object returns to water, the
process is called alighting, although it is commonly called "landing" and
"touchdown" as well. A normal aircraft flight would include several parts of
flight including taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent and landing.
*** Short takeoff and landing (STOL)[edit] ***
Main article: STOL
STOL is an acronym for short take-off and landing, aircraft with very short
runway requirements.
*** Catapult launch and arrested recovery (CATOBAR)[edit] ***
Main article: CATOBAR
Catapult launches aboard USS Ronald Reagan
CATOBAR (catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery) is a system used for
the launch and recovery of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft_carrier. Under
this technique, aircraft are launched using a catapult and land on the ship
(the recovery phase) using arrestor_wires.
Although this system is more costly than alternative methods, it provides
greater flexibility in carrier operations, since it allows the vessel to
support conventional aircraft. Alternate methods of launch and recovery can
only use aircraft with STOVL or STOBAR capability.
*** Short Take Off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR)[edit] ***
Main article: STOBAR
STOBAR (Short Take Off But Arrested Recovery) is a system used for the launch
and recovery of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft_carrier, combining
elements of both STOVL (Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing) and CATOBAR
(Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery).
**** Spacecraft (HTHL)[edit] ****
Horizontal takeoff, horizontal landing (HTHL) â is the mode of operation for
the first private commercial spaceplane, the two-stage-to-space Scaled
Composites_Tier_One from the Ansari_X-Prize SpaceShipOne/WhiteKnightOne
combination. It is also used for the upcoming Tier_1b SpaceShipTwo/
WhiteKnightTwo combination. A prominent example of its use was the North
American_X-15 program. In these examples the space craft are carried to
altitude on a "mother ship" before launch. The failed proposals for NASA Space
Shuttle replacements, Rockwell_X-30 NASP used this mode of operation but were
conceived as single stage to orbit.
The Lynx_rocketplane is a suborbital HTHL spaceplane that was slated to begin
atmospheric flight testing in late 2011,[1] yet has not as of late 2015.
Reaction_Engines_Skylon, a design descendant of the 1980s British HOTOL
("Horizontal Take-Off and Landing") design project, is an HTHL spaceplane
currently in the early stages of development in the United_Kingdom.[2]
Both the Lynx_rocketplane and SpaceShipTwo have been proffered to NASA to carry
suborbital research payloads in response to NASA's suborbital reusable launch
vehicle (sRLV) solicitation under the NASA Flight Operations Program.[3]
An early example was the 1960s Northrop_HL-10 atmospheric test aircraft where
the HL stands for "Horizontal Lander".[4]
***** Vertical takeoff and landing[edit] *****
Different terms are used for takeoff and landing depending on the source of
thrust used. VTVL uses rockets, whereas VTOL uses air, propelled via some kind
of rotor system.
**** Aircraft (VTOL)[edit] ****
Main article: VTOL
VTOL is an acronym for vertical take-off and landing aircraft. This
classification includes fixed-wing_aircraft that can hover, take off and land
vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such
as tiltrotors.[5][6][7][8] The terminology for spacecraft and rockets is VTVL
(vertical takeoff with vertical landing).[9] Some VTOL aircraft can operate in
other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off and landing), STOL
(short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL (short take-off and vertical
landing). Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to
the aircraft lacking landing_gear that can handle horizontal motion. VTOL is a
subset of V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing).
Besides the ubiquitous helicopter, there are currently two types of VTOL
aircraft in military service: craft using a tiltrotor, such as the Bell Boeing
V-22_Osprey, and aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the Harrier_family.
**** Rocket (VTVL)[edit] ****
Main article: VTVL
Vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) is a form of takeoff and landing
often proposed for expendable spacecraft. Multiple VTVL rocket craft have
flown.[citation_needed]
***** Vertical takeoff and horizontal landing[edit] *****
**** Aircraft (VTOHL)[edit] ****
In aviation the term VTOHL ("Vertical Take-Off and Horizontal Landing") as well
as several VTOHL aviation-specific subtypes: VTOCL, VTOSL, VTOBAR exist.
*** Zero length launch system[edit] ***
Main article: Zero_length_launch
The zero length launch system or zero length take-off system (ZLL, ZLTO, ZEL,
ZELL) was a system whereby jet fighters and attack_aircraft were intended to be
placed upon rockets attached to mobile launch_platforms. Most zero length
launch experiments took place in the 1950s, during the Cold_War.
**** Spacecraft (VTHL)[edit] ****
VTHLâvertical takeoff, horizontal landingâis the mode of operation for all
current and formerly operational orbital spaceplanes, such as the Boeing_X-37,
the NASA Space_Shuttle, the 1988 Soviet Buran_space_shuttle, as well as the
circa-1960 USAF Boeing_X-20_Dyna-Soar project. For launch vehicles an advantage
of VTHL over HTHL is that the wing can be smaller, since it only has to carry
the landing weight of the vehicle, rather than the takeoff weight.[10]
There have been several other VTHL proposals that never flew including NASA
Space Shuttle proposed replacements Lockheed_Martin_X-33 and VentureStar. The
1990s NASA concept spaceplane, the HL-20_Personnel_Launch_System (HL stands for
"Horizontal Lander"), was VTHL, as was a circa-2003 derivative of the HL-20,
the Orbital_Space_Plane concept.
As of March 2011[update], two VTHL commercial spaceplanes were in various
stages of proposal/development, both successors to the HL-20 design. The Sierra
Nevada_Corporation Dream_Chaser follows the outer_mold_line of the earlier HL-
20. The circa-2011 proposed Orbital_Sciences_Corporation Prometheus was a
blended_lifting_body spaceplane that followed the outer mold line of the circa-
2003 Orbital Space Plane, itself a derivative of the HL-20; however, Prometheus
did not receive any NASA contracts and Orbital has announced they will not
pursue further development.[11]
German_Aerospace_Center studied reusable VTHL Liquid_Fly-back_Boosters from
1999. Design was intended to replace Ariane_5 solid_rocket_boosters.[12] The
U.S._government-funded, US$250,000,000, Reusable_Booster_System program,
initiated by the USAF in 2010,[13] had specified a high-level requirement that
the design be VTHL,[14] but the funding was discontinued after 2012.[15]
In 2017 DARPA selected a VTHL design for XS-1.
***** HTVL[edit] *****
HTVL or horizontal takeoff and vertical landing is the spaceflight equivalent
of aviation HTOVL (and its subtypes CTOVL, STOVL, CATOVL). This mode of
operation has not been used, but has been proposed for some systems that use a
two-stage to orbit launch system with a plane based first stage, and a capsule
return vehicle. One of the few HTVL concept vehicles is the 1960s concept
spacecraft Hyperion_SSTO, designed by Philip_Bono.[16]
***** Multi-mode configurations[edit] *****
Vehicles use more than one mode also exist.
**** Vertical/Short takeoff landing (V/STOL)[edit] ****
Main article: V/STOL
Vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft that are able to
take off or land vertically or on short runways. Vertical takeoff and landing
(VTOL) includes craft that do not require runways at all. Generally, a V/STOL
aircraft needs to be able to hover; helicopters are not typically considered
under the V/STOL classification.
A rolling takeoff, sometimes with a ramp (ski-jump), reduces the amount of
thrust required to lift an aircraft from the ground (compared with vertical
takeoff), and hence increases the payload and range that can be achieved for a
given thrust. For instance, the Harrier is incapable of taking off vertically
with a full weapons and fuel load. Hence V/STOL aircraft generally use a runway
if it is available. I.e. Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) or
Conventional Take-off and Landing (CTOL) operation is preferred to VTOL
operation.
V/STOL was developed to allow fast jets to be operated from clearings in
forests, from very short runways, and from small aircraft_carriers that would
previously only have been able to carry helicopters.
The main advantage of V/STOL aircraft is closer basing to the enemy, which
reduces response time and tanker support requirements. In the case of the
Falklands_War, it also permitted high performance fighter air cover and ground
attack without a large aircraft carrier equipped with a catapult.
The latest V/STOL aircraft is the F-35B, which is expected to enter service in
2016.[17]
