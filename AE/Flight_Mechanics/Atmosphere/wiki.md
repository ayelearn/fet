Mars's thin atmosphere
The layers of Earth's atmosphere
An atmosphere (from Ancient_Greek á¼ÏÎ¼ÏÏ (atmos), meaning 'vapour', and
ÏÏÎ±á¿ÏÎ± (sphaira), meaning 'ball' or 'sphere'[1][2]) is a layer or a set
of layers of gases surrounding a planet or other material_body, that is held in
place by the gravity of that body. An atmosphere is more likely to be retained
if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere
is low.
The atmosphere_of_Earth is composed of nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about
21%), argon (about 0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%) and other gases in trace
amounts. Oxygen is used by most organisms for respiration; nitrogen is fixed by
bacteria and lightning to produce ammonia used in the construction of
nucleotides and amino_acids; and carbon_dioxide is used by plants, algae and
cyanobacteria for photosynthesis. The atmosphere helps to protect living
organisms from genetic damage by solar ultraviolet radiation, solar_wind and
cosmic_rays. The current composition of the Earth's atmosphere is the product
of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by
living organisms.
The term stellar_atmosphere describes the outer region of a star and typically
includes the portion above the opaque photosphere. Stars with sufficiently low
temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound molecules.

***** Pressure[edit] *****
Main article: Atmospheric_pressure
Atmospheric pressure at a particular location is the force per unit area
perpendicular to a surface determined by the weight of the vertical column of
atmosphere above that location. On Earth, units of air pressure are based on
the internationally recognized standard_atmosphere (atm), which is defined as
101.325 kPa (760 Torr or 14.696 psi). It is measured with a barometer.
Atmospheric_pressure decreases with increasing altitude due to the diminishing
mass of gas above. The height at which the pressure from an atmosphere declines
by a factor of e (an irrational_number with a value of 2.71828...) is called
the scale_height and is denoted by H. For an atmosphere with a uniform
temperature, the scale height is proportional to the temperature and inversely
proportional to the product of the mean molecular_mass of dry air and the local
acceleration of gravity at that location. For such a model atmosphere, the
pressure declines exponentially with increasing altitude. However, atmospheres
are not uniform in temperature, so estimation of the atmospheric pressure at
any particular altitude is more complex.
***** Atmospheric escape[edit] *****
Main article: Atmospheric_escape
Surface_gravity differs significantly among the planets. For example, the large
gravitational force of the giant planet Jupiter retains light gases such as
hydrogen and helium that escape from objects with lower gravity. Secondly, the
distance from the Sun determines the energy available to heat atmospheric gas
to the point where some fraction of its molecules' thermal_motion exceed the
planet's escape_velocity, allowing those to escape a planet's gravitational
grasp. Thus, distant and cold Titan, Triton, and Pluto are able to retain their
atmospheres despite their relatively low gravities.
Since a collection of gas molecules may be moving at a wide range of
velocities, there will always be some fast enough to produce a slow leakage of
gas into space. Lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones with the same
thermal kinetic_energy, and so gases of low molecular_weight are lost more
rapidly than those of high molecular weight. It is thought that Venus and Mars
may have lost much of their water when, after being photo_dissociated into
hydrogen and oxygen by solar ultraviolet, the hydrogen escaped. Earth's
magnetic_field helps to prevent this, as, normally, the solar wind would
greatly enhance the escape of hydrogen. However, over the past 3 billion years
Earth may have lost gases through the magnetic polar regions due to auroral
activity, including a net 2% of its atmospheric oxygen.[3] The net effect,
taking the most important escape processes into account, is that an intrinsic
magnetic field does not protect a planet from atmospheric escape and that for
some magnetizations the presence of a magnetic field works to increase the
escape rate.[4]
Other mechanisms that can cause atmosphere_depletion are solar_wind-induced
sputtering, impact erosion, weathering, and sequestrationâsometimes referred
to as "freezing out"âinto the regolith and polar_caps.
***** Terrain[edit] *****
Atmospheres have dramatic effects on the surfaces of rocky bodies. Objects that
have no atmosphere, or that have only an exosphere, have terrain that is
covered in craters. Without an atmosphere, the planet has no protection from
meteoroids, and all of them collide with the surface as meteorites and create
craters.
Most meteoroids burn up as meteors before hitting a planet's surface. When
meteoroids do impact, the effects are often erased by the action of wind.[5] As
a result, craters are rare on objects with atmospheres.[clarification_needed]
Wind_erosion is a significant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets
with atmospheres, and over time can erase the effects of both craters and
volcanoes. In addition, since liquids can not exist without pressure, an
atmosphere allows liquid to be present at the surface, resulting in lakes,
rivers and oceans. Earth and Titan are known to have liquids at their surface
and terrain on the planet suggests that Mars had liquid on its surface in the
past.
***** Composition[edit] *****
Earth's atmospheric gases scatter blue light more than other wavelengths,
giving Earth a blue halo when seen from space
A planet's initial atmospheric composition is related to the chemistry and
temperature of the local solar_nebula during planetary formation and the
subsequent escape of interior gases. The original atmospheres started with a
rotating disc of gases that collapsed to form a series of spaced rings that
condensed to form the planets. The planet's atmospheres were then modified over
time by various complex factors, resulting in quite different outcomes.
The atmospheres of the planets Venus and Mars are primarily composed of carbon
dioxide, with small quantities of nitrogen, argon, oxygen and traces of other
gases.
The composition of Earth's atmosphere is largely governed by the by-products of
the life that it sustains. Dry air from Earth's_atmosphere contains 78.08%
nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and traces of
hydrogen, helium, and other "noble" gases (by volume), but generally a variable
amount of water vapor is also present, on average about 1% at sea level.
The low temperatures and higher gravity of the Solar System's giant
planetsâJupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptuneâallow them more readily to
retain gases with low molecular_masses. These planets have hydrogenâhelium
atmospheres, with trace amounts of more complex compounds.
Two satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres. Titan, a
moon of Saturn, and Triton, a moon of Neptune, have atmospheres mainly of
nitrogen. When in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, Pluto has an
atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to Triton's, but these gases are
frozen when it is farther from the Sun.
Other bodies within the Solar_System have extremely thin atmospheres not in
equilibrium. These include the Moon (sodium gas), Mercury (sodium gas), Europa
(oxygen), Io (sulfur), and Enceladus (water_vapor).
The first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is HD_209458b,
a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the constellation Pegasus. Its
atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000 K, and is steadily escaping
into space. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and sulfur have been detected in the
planet's inflated atmosphere.[6]
***** Structure[edit] *****
**** Earth[edit] ****
Main article: Atmosphere_of_Earth
Earth's_atmosphere consists of a number of layers that differ in properties
such as composition, temperature and pressure. The lowest layer is the
troposphere, which extends from the surface to the bottom of the stratosphere.
Three quarters of the atmosphere's mass resides within the troposphere, and is
the layer within which the Earth's terrestrial weather develops. The depth of
this layer varies between 17 km at the equator to 7 km at the poles. The
stratosphere, extending from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the
mesosphere, contains the ozone_layer. The ozone layer ranges in altitude
between 15 and 35 km, and is where most of the ultraviolet radiation from the
Sun is absorbed. The top of the mesosphere, ranges from 50 to 85 km, and is the
layer wherein most meteors burn up. The thermosphere extends from 85 km to the
base of the exosphere at 400 km and contains the ionosphere, a region where the
atmosphere is ionised by incoming solar radiation. The ionosphere increases in
thickness and moves closer to the Earth during daylight and rises at night
allowing certain frequencies of radio communication a greater range. The
KÃ¡rmÃ¡n_line, located within the thermosphere at an altitude of 100 km, is
commonly used to define the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer
space. The exosphere begins variously from about 690 to 1,000 km above the
surface, where it interacts with the planet's magnetosphere. Each of the layers
has a different lapse_rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with
height.

*** Outside the Solar System[edit] ***

***** Circulation[edit] *****
Main article: Atmospheric_circulation
The circulation of the atmosphere occurs due to thermal differences when
convection becomes a more efficient transporter of heat than thermal_radiation.
On planets where the primary heat source is solar radiation, excess heat in the
tropics is transported to higher latitudes. When a planet generates a
significant amount of heat internally, such as is the case for Jupiter,
convection in the atmosphere can transport thermal energy from the higher
temperature interior up to the surface.
***** Importance[edit] *****
From the perspective of a planetary geologist, the atmosphere acts to shape a
planetary surface. Wind picks up dust and other particles which, when they
collide with the terrain, erode the relief and leave deposits (eolian
processes). Frost and precipitations, which depend on the atmospheric
composition, also influence the relief. Climate changes can influence a
planet's geological history. Conversely, studying the surface of the Earth
leads to an understanding of the atmosphere and climate of other planets.
For a meteorologist, the composition of the Earth's atmosphere is a factor
affecting the climate and its variations.
For a biologist or paleontologist, the Earth's atmospheric composition is
closely dependent on the appearance of the life and its evolution.
