A turboprop engine is a turbine_engine that drives an aircraft propeller.[1]
In its simplest form a turboprop consists of an intake, compressor, combustor,
turbine, and a propelling_nozzle.[2] Air is drawn into the intake and
compressed by the compressor. Fuel is then added to the compressed air in the
combustor, where the fuel-air mixture then combusts. The hot combustion gases
expand through the turbine. Some of the power generated by the turbine is used
to drive the compressor. The rest is transmitted through the reduction gearing
to the propeller. Further expansion of the gases occurs in the propelling
nozzle, where the gases exhaust to atmospheric pressure. The propelling nozzle
provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop.
[3]
In contrast to a turbojet, the engine's exhaust_gases do not generally contain
enough energy to create significant thrust, since almost all of the engine's
power is used to drive the propeller.

Propulsive efficiency comparison for various gas turbine engine configurations
Exhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favour of shaft power, which is
obtained by extracting additional power (up to that necessary to drive the
compressor) from turbine expansion. Owing to the additional expansion in the
turbine system, the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low.[4][5][6]
Consequently, the exhaust jet typically produces around or less than 10% of the
total thrust.[7] A higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at
low speeds and less at higher speeds.[8]
Turboprops can have bypass_ratios up to 50-100[9][10][11] although the
propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans.[12]
[13]
The propeller is coupled to the turbine through a reduction_gear that converts
the high RPM/low torque output to low RPM/high torque. The propeller itself is
normally a constant_speed_(variable_pitch)_type similar to that used with
larger reciprocating_aircraft_engines.[citation_needed]
Unlike the small diameter fans used in turbofan jet engines, the propeller has
a large diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air. This permits a
lower airstream velocity for a given amount of thrust. As it is more efficient
at low speeds to accelerate a large amount of air by a small degree than a
small amount of air by a large degree,[14][15] a low disc_loading (thrust per
disc area) increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the
fuel use.[16][17]
Propellers lose efficiency as aircraft speed increases, so turboprops are
normally not used on high-speed aircraft[4][5][6] above Mach 0.6-0.7.[7]
However, propfan engines, which are very similar to turboprop engines, can
cruise at flight speeds approaching Mach 0.75. To increase propeller
efficiency, a mechanism can be used to alter their pitch relative to the
airspeed. A variable-pitch propeller, also called a controllable-pitch
propeller, can also be used to generate negative thrust while decelerating on
the runway. Additionally, in the event of an engine failure, the pitch can be
adjusted to a vaning pitch (called feathering), thus minimizing the drag of the
non-functioning propeller.[18]
While most modern turbojet and turbofan engines use axial-flow_compressors,
turboprop engines usually contain at least one stage of centrifugal
compression. Centrifugal compressors have the advantage of being simple and
lightweight, at the expense of a streamlined shape.[citation_needed]
While the power turbine may be integral with the gas generator section, many
turboprops today feature a free power turbine on a separate coaxial shaft. This
enables the propeller to rotate freely, independent of compressor speed.[19]
Residual_thrust on a turboshaft is avoided by further expansion in the turbine
system and/or truncating and turning the exhaust 180 degrees, to produce two
opposing jets. Apart from the above, there is very little difference between a
turboprop and a turboshaft.[11]
***** History[edit] *****
Alan_Arnold_Griffith had published a paper on turbine design in 1926.
Subsequent_work_at_the_Royal_Aircraft_Establishment investigated axial turbine
designs that could be used to supply power to a shaft and thence a propeller.
From 1929, Frank_Whittle began work on centrifugal turbine designs that would
deliver pure jet thrust.[20]
The world's first turboprop was designed by the Hungarian mechanical_engineer
GyÃ¶rgy_Jendrassik.[21] Jendrassik published a turboprop idea in 1928, and on
12 March 1929 he patented his invention. In 1938, he built a small-scale (100
Hp; 74.6 kW) experimental gas turbine.[22] The larger Jendrassik_Cs-1, with a
predicted output of 1,000 bhp, was produced and tested at the Ganz_Works in
Budapest between 1937 and 1941. It was of axial-flow design with 15 compressor
and 7 turbine stages, annular combustion chamber and many other modern
features. First run in 1940, combustion problems limited its output to 400 bhp.
In 1941,the engine was abandoned due to war, and the factory was turned over to
conventional engine production. The world's first turboprop engine that went
into mass production[specify] was designed by a German engineer, Max_Adolf
Mueller, in 1942.[23]
A Rolls-Royce RB.50 Trent on a test rig at Hucknall, in March 1945
The first mention of turboprop engines in the general public press was in the
February 1944 issue of the British aviation publication Flight, which included
a detailed cutaway drawing of what a possible future turboprop engine could
look like. The drawing was very close to what the future Rolls-Royce Trent
would look like.[24] The first British turboprop engine was the Rolls-Royce
RB.50_Trent, a converted Derwent_II fitted with reduction gear and a Rotol 7 ft
11 in (2.41 m) five-bladed propeller. Two Trents were fitted to Gloster_Meteor
EE227 — the sole "Trent-Meteor" — which thus became the world's first
turboprop-powered aircraft, albeit a test-bed not intended for production.[25]
[26] It first flew on 20 September 1945. From their experience with the Trent,
Rolls-Royce developed the Rolls-Royce_Clyde, the first turboprop engine to be
fully type_certificated for military and civil use,[27] and the Dart, which
became one of the most reliable turboprop engines ever built. Dart production
continued for more than fifty years. The Dart-powered Vickers_Viscount was the
first turboprop aircraft of any kind to go into production and sold in large
numbers.[28] It was also the first four-engined turboprop. Its first flight was
on 16 July 1948. The world's first single engined turboprop aircraft was the
Armstrong_Siddeley_Mamba-powered Boulton_Paul_Balliol, which first flew on 24
March 1948.[29]
The Kuznetsov_NK-12 is still the most powerful turboprop
The Soviet Union built on German World War II development by Junkers
Motorenwerke, while BMW, Heinkel-Hirth and Daimler-Benz also developed and
partially tested designs.[citation_needed] While the Soviet Union had the
technology to create the airframe for a jet-powered strategic bomber comparable
to Boeing's B-52_Stratofortress, they instead produced the Tupolev_Tu-95 Bear,
powered with four Kuznetsov_NK-12 turboprops, mated to eight contra-rotating
propellers (two per nacelle) with supersonic tip speeds to achieve maximum
cruise speeds in excess of 575 mph, faster than many of the first jet aircraft
and comparable to jet cruising speeds for most missions. The Bear would serve
as their most successful long-range combat and surveillance aircraft and symbol
of Soviet power projection throughout the end of the 20th century. The USA
would incorporate contra-rotating turboprop engines, such as the ill-fated
twin-turbine Allison_T40 â essentially a twinned up pair of Allison_T38
turboprop engines driving contra-rotating propellers â into a series of
experimental aircraft during the 1950s, with aircraft powered with the T40,
like the Convair_R3Y_Tradewind flying boat never entering U.S. Navy service.
The first American turboprop engine was the General_Electric XT31, first used
in the experimental Consolidated_Vultee_XP-81.[30] The XP-81 first flew in
December 1945, the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and
turbojet power. The technology of the Allison's earlier T38 design evolved into
the Allison_T56, with quartets of the T56s being used to power the Lockheed
Electra airliner, its military maritime patrol derivative the P-3_Orion, and
the widely produced C-130_Hercules military transport aircraft. One of the most
produced turboprop engines used in civil aviation is the Pratt_&_Whitney_Canada
PT6 engine.[citation_needed]
The first turbine-powered, shaft-driven helicopter was the Kaman_K-225, a
development of Charles_Kaman's K-125 synchropter, which used a Boeing_T50
turboshaft engine to power it on 11 December 1951.[31]
***** Usage[edit] *****

built
Compared to turbofans, turboprops are most efficient at flight speeds below
725 km/h (450 mph; 390 knots) because the jet velocity of the propeller (and
exhaust) is relatively low. Modern turboprop airliners operate at nearly the
same speed as small regional_jet airliners but burn two-thirds of the fuel per
passenger.[32] However, compared to a turbojet (which can fly at high altitude
for enhanced speed and fuel_efficiency) a propeller aircraft has a lower
ceiling.
The Beech_King_Air and Super_King_Air are the most-delivered turboprop business
aircraft in history, with a combined 7,300 examples as of May 2018[33]
The most common application of turboprop engines in civilian aviation is in
small commuter_aircraft, where their greater power and reliability offsets
their higher initial cost and fuel consumption. Turboprop-powered aircraft have
become popular for bush_airplanes such as the Cessna_Caravan and Quest_Kodiak
as jet_fuel is easier to obtain in remote areas than avgas.[citation_needed]
Due to the high price of turboprop engines, they are mostly used where high-
performance short-takeoff and landing (STOL) capability and efficiency at
modest flight speeds are required.
Turboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft, but the
Tupolev_Tu-114 can reach 470 kt (870 km/h, 541 mph). Large military and civil
aircraft, such as the Lockheed_L-188_Electra and the Tupolev_Tu-95, have also
used turboprop power. The Airbus_A400M is powered by four Europrop_TP400
engines, which are the second most powerful turboprop engines ever produced,
after the eleven megawatt-output Kuznetsov_NK-12.
In 2017, The most widespread turboprop airliners in service were the ATR_42/72
(950 aircraft), Bombardier_Q400 (506) and Dash 8-100/200/300 (374), Beechcraft
1900 (328), de_Havilland_Canada_DHC-6_Twin_Otter (270), Saab_340 (225).[34]
Less widespread and older airliners include the BAe_Jetstream_31, Embraer_EMB
120_Brasilia, Fairchild_Swearingen_Metroliner, Dornier_328, Saab_2000, Xian
MA60, MA600 and MA700, Fokker_27 and 50.
Turboprop business_aircraft include the Piper_Meridian, Socata_TBM, Pilatus_PC-
12, Piaggio_P.180_Avanti, Beechcraft_King_Air and Super_King_Air. In April
2017, there were 14,311 business turboprops in the worldwide fleet.[35]
**** Reliability[edit] ****
Between 2012 and 2016, the ATSB observed 417 events with turboprop aircraft, 83
per year, over 1.4 million flight hours: 2.2 per 10,000 hours. Three were
âhigh riskâ involving engine malfunction and unplanned landing in
singleâengine Cessna_208_Caravans, four âmedium riskâ and 96% âlow
riskâ. Two occurrences resulted in minor injuries due to engine malfunction
and terrain collision in agricultural_aircraft and five accidents involved
aerial work: four in agriculture and one in an air_ambulance.[36]

      Quote: "If the cowl is removed from the fan the result is a turboprop
      engine. Turbofan and turboprop engines differ mainly in their bypass
      ratio: 5 or 6 for turbofans and as high as 100 for turboprop."

      Wiley & Sons, 15 April 2008. Quote: "It has better fuel consumption than
      a turbojet or turbofan, due to a high propulsive efficiency.., achieving
      thrust by a high mass flow of air from the propeller at low jet velocity.
      Above 0.6 Mach number the turboprop in turn becomes uncompetitive, due
      mainly to higher weight and frontal area."
