A Pratt_&_Whitney_F100 jet engine being tested. This engine produces a jet of
gas to generate thrust. Its purpose is to propel a jet airplane.
Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton's_third_law. When
a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will
cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on that system.[1] The
force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the
surface is also called thrust. Force, and thus thrust, is measured using the
International_System_of_Units (SI) in newtons (symbol: N), and represents the
amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter_per
second_per_second. In mechanical_engineering, force orthogonal to the main load
(such as in parallel helical_gears) is referred to as thrust.

***** Examples[edit] *****
Forces on an aerofoil cross section
A fixed-wing_aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the
direction opposite to flight. This can be done in several ways including by the
spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back
of a jet_engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket_engine.[2] The forward
thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the
difference in velocity of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid
braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller
blades, or using a thrust_reverser on a jet engine. Rotary_wing_aircraft and
thrust_vectoring V/STOL aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the
aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.
A motorboat generates thrust (or reverse thrust) when the propellers are turned
to accelerate water backwards (or forwards). The resulting thrust pushes the
boat in the opposite direction to the sum of the momentum change in the water
flowing through the propeller.
A rocket is propelled forward by a thrust force equal in magnitude, but
opposite in direction, to the time-rate of momentum change of the exhaust_gas
accelerated from the combustion chamber through the rocket engine nozzle. This
is the exhaust_velocity with respect to the rocket, times the time-rate at
which the mass is expelled, or in mathematical terms:
          T  =  v      d  m    d  t      {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\mathbf
      {v} {\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {T}
      =\mathbf {v} {\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}}]
Where T is the thrust generated (force),         d  m    d  t
{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
{\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}}] is the rate of change of mass with respect to
time (mass flow rate of exhaust), and v is the speed of the exhaust gases
measured relative to the rocket.
For vertical launch of a rocket the initial thrust at liftoff must be more than
the weight.
Each of the three Space_Shuttle Main_Engines could produce a thrust of
1.8 meganewton, and each of the Space Shuttle's two Solid_Rocket_Boosters
14.7 MN (3,300,000 lbf), together 29.4 MN.[3]
By contrast, the simplified_Aid_For_EVA_Rescue (SAFER) has 24 thrusters of
3.56 N (0.80 lbf) each.[citation_needed]
In the air-breathing category, the AMT-USA AT-180 jet engine developed for
radio-controlled_aircraft produce 90 N (20 lbf) of thrust.[4] The GE90-115B
engine fitted on the Boeing_777-300ER, recognized by the Guinness_Book_of_World
Records as the "World's Most Powerful Commercial Jet Engine," has a thrust of
569 kN (127,900 lbf).
***** Concepts[edit] *****
**** Thrust to power[edit] ****
The power needed to generate thrust and the force of the thrust can be related
in a non-linear way. In general,       P   2   &#x221D;   T   3
{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{2}\propto \mathbf {T} ^{3}}  [{\mathbf  {P}}^
{2}\propto {\mathbf  {T}}^{3}]. The proportionality constant varies, and can be
solved for a uniform flow:
             d  m    d  t    = &#x03C1; A  v    {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm
      {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=\rho A{v}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} m}
      {\mathrm {d} t}}=\rho A{v}}]
          T  =     d  m    d  t     v  ,  P  =   1 2       d  m    d  t      v
      2     {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}
      {v},\mathbf {P} ={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}{v}^
      {2}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}
      {v},\mathbf {P} ={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}{v}^
      {2}}]
          T  = &#x03C1; A   v   2   ,  P  =   1 2   &#x03C1; A   v   3
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\rho A{v}^{2},\mathbf {P} ={\frac {1}{2}}\rho
      A{v}^{3}}  [{\mathbf  {T}}=\rho A{v}^{2},{\mathbf  {P}}={\frac  {1}
      {2}}\rho A{v}^{3}]
           P   2   =     T   3    4 &#x03C1; A      {\displaystyle \mathbf {P}
      ^{2}={\frac {\mathbf {T} ^{3}}{4\rho A}}}  [{\mathbf  {P}}^{2}={\frac  {
      {\mathbf  {T}}^{3}}{4\rho A}}]
Note that these calculations are only valid for when the incoming air is
accelerated from a standstill â for example when hovering.
The inverse of the proportionality constant, the "efficiency" of an otherwise-
perfect thruster, is proportional to the area of the cross section of the
propelled volume of fluid (    A   {\displaystyle A}  [A]) and the density of
the fluid (    &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ]). This helps to
explain why moving through water is easier and why aircraft have much larger
propellers than watercraft.
**** Thrust to propulsive power[edit] ****
A very common question is how to compare the thrust rating of a jet engine with
the power rating of a piston engine. Such comparison is difficult, as these
quantities are not equivalent. A piston engine does not move the aircraft by
itself (the propeller does that), so piston engines are usually rated by how
much power they deliver to the propeller. Except for changes in temperature and
air pressure, this quantity depends basically on the throttle setting.
A jet engine has no propeller, so the propulsive power of a jet engine is
determined from its thrust as follows. Power is the force (F) it takes to move
something over some distance (d) divided by the time (t) it takes to move that
distance:[5]
          P  =  F    d t     {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\mathbf {F} {\frac {d}
      {t}}}  [{\mathbf  {P}}={\mathbf  {F}}{\frac  {d}{t}}]
In case of a rocket or a jet aircraft, the force is exactly the thrust (T)
produced by the engine. If the rocket or aircraft is moving at about a constant
speed, then distance divided by time is just speed, so power is thrust times
speed:[6]
          P  =  T   v    {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\mathbf {T} {v}}  [
      {\mathbf  {P}}={\mathbf  {T}}{v}]
This formula looks very surprising, but it is correct: the propulsive power (or
power available [7]) of a jet engine increases with its speed. If the speed is
zero, then the propulsive power is zero. If a jet aircraft is at full throttle
but attached to a static test stand, then the jet engine produces no propulsive
power, however thrust is still produced. Compare that to a piston_engine. The
combination piston engineâpropeller also has a propulsive power with exactly
the same formula, and it will also be zero at zero speed â but that is for
the engineâpropeller set. The engine alone will continue to produce its rated
power at a constant rate, whether the aircraft is moving or not.
Now, imagine the strong chain is broken, and the jet and the piston aircraft
start to move. At low speeds:
     The piston engine will have constant 100% power, and the propeller's
     thrust will vary with speed
     The jet engine will have constant 100% thrust, and the engine's power
     will vary with speed
**** Excess thrust[edit] ****
If a powered aircraft is generating thrust T and experiencing drag D, the
difference between the two, T â D, is termed the excess thrust. The
instantaneous performance of the aircraft is mostly dependent on the excess
thrust.
Excess thrust is a vector and is determined as the vector difference between
the thrust vector and the drag vector.
**** Thrust axis[edit] ****
The thrust axis for an airplane is the line_of_action of the total thrust at
any instant. It depends on the location, number, and characteristics of the jet
engines or propellers. It usually differs from the drag axis. If so, the
distance between the thrust axis and the drag axis will cause a moment that
must be resisted by a change in the aerodynamic force on the horizontal
stabiliser.[8] Notably, the Boeing_737_MAX, with larger, lower-slung engines
than previous 737 models, had a greater distance between the thrust axis and
the drag axis, causing the nose to rise up in some flight regimes,
necessitating a pitch-control system, MCAS.[9][10]
