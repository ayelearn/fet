A turboshaft engine is a form of gas_turbine that is optimized to produce shaft
power rather than jet_thrust.
In concept, turboshaft engines are very similar to turbojets, with additional
turbine expansion to extract heat energy from the exhaust and convert it into
output shaft power. They are even more similar to turboprops, with only minor
differences, and a single engine is often sold in both forms.
Turboshaft engines are commonly used in applications that require a sustained
high power output, high reliability, small size, and light weight. These
include helicopters, auxiliary_power_units, boats and ships, tanks, hovercraft,
and stationary equipment.

***** Overview[edit] *****
A turboshaft engine may be made up of two major parts assemblies: the 'gas
generator' and the 'power section'. The gas generator consists of the
compressor, combustion_chambers with ignitors and fuel nozzles, and one or more
stages of turbine. The power section consists of additional stages of turbines,
a gear_reduction system, and the shaft output. The gas generator creates the
hot expanding gases to drive the power section. Depending on the design, the
engine accessories may be driven either by the gas generator or by the power
section.
In most designs, the gas generator and power section are mechanically separate
so they can each rotate at different speeds appropriate for the conditions,
referred to as a 'free power turbine'. A free power turbine can be an extremely
useful design feature for vehicles, as it allows the design to forgo the weight
and cost of complex multiple-ratio transmissions and clutches.
The general layout of a turboshaft is similar to that of a turboprop. The main
difference is a turboprop is structurally designed to support the loads created
by a rotating propeller, as the propeller is not attached to anything but the
engine itself. In contrast, turboshaft engines usually drive a transmission
which is not structurally attached to the engine. The transmission is attached
to the vehicle structure and supports the loads created instead of the engine.
In practice, though, many of the same engines are built in both turboprop and
turboshaft versions, with only minor differences.
An unusual example of the turboshaft principle is the Pratt_&_Whitney_F135-PW-
600 turbofan engine for the STOVL F-35B â in conventional mode it operates as
a turbofan, but when powering the LiftFan, it switches partially to turboshaft
mode to send 29,000 horsepower forward through a shaft[1] and partially to
turbofan mode to continue to send thrust to the main engine's fan and rear
nozzle.
Large helicopters use two or three turboshaft engines for redundancy. The Mil
Mi-26 uses two Lotarev D-136 at 11,400 hp each,[2] while the Sikorsky_CH-53E
Super_Stallion uses three General_Electric_T64 at 4,380 hp each.[3]
Early turboshaft engines were adaptations of turboprop engines, delivering
power through a shaft driven directly from the gas generator shafts, via a
reduction gearbox. Examples of direct-drive turboshafts include marinised or
industrial Rolls-Royce_Dart engines.

***** History[edit] *****
The first examples of a gas turbine engine design ever considered for armoured
fighting vehicles, the BMW_003-based GT_101, were tested in Nazi Germany's
Panther_tanks in mid-1944.[4] The first true turboshaft engine for helicopters
was built by the French engine firm Turbomeca, led by the founder, Joseph
Szydlowski. In 1948, they built the first French-designed turbine engine, the
100-shp 782. Originally conceived as an auxiliary_power_unit, it was soon
adapted to aircraft propulsion, and found a niche as a powerplant for
turboshaft-driven helicopters in the 1950s. In 1950, this work was used to
develop the larger 280-shp Artouste, which was widely used on the AÃ©rospatiale
Alouette_II and other helicopters. This was following the experimental
installation of a Boeing_T50 turboshaft in an example of the Kaman_K-225
synchropter on December 11, 1951, as the world's first-ever turboshaft-powered
helicopter of any type to fly.[5] The T-80 tank, which entered service with the
Soviet_Army in 1976, was the first tank using a gas turbine as the main engine.
Since 1980 the US_Army has operated the M1_Abrams tank. Designed and built in
the late 1970s, this tank makes use of a gas turbine engine compared to most
tanks using reciprocating diesels. The engine has considerably fewer parts,
mechanically is very reliable, produces reduced exterior noise, and runs on
virtually any fuel: petrol (gasoline), diesel_fuel, aviation fuels. Similarly,
the Swedish Stridsvagn_103 was the first tank to utilize a gas turbine, in this
case as a secondary, high-horsepower "sprint" engine to augment the primary
piston engine's performance.
