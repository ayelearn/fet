Propulsion means to push forward or drive an object forward .[1] The term is
derived from two Latin words: pro, meaningbefore or forward; and pellere,
meaning to drive.[2] A propulsion system consists of a source of mechanical
power, and a propulsor (means of converting this power into propulsive force).
A technological system uses an engine_or_motor as the power source (commonly
called a powerplant), and wheels_and_axles, propellers, or a propulsive_nozzle
to generate the force. Components such as clutches or gearboxes may be needed
to connect the motor to axles, wheels, or propellers.
Biological propulsion systems use an animal's muscles as the power source, and
limbs such as wings, fins or legs as the propulsors.
A technological/biological system may use human, or trained animal, muscular
work to power a mechanical device.

***** Vehicular propulsion[edit] *****
**** Air propulsion[edit] ****
Main article: Powered_aircraft
A turboprop-engined Tupolev_Tu-95
An aircraft propulsion system generally consists of an aircraft_engine and some
means to generate thrust, such as a propeller or a propulsive_nozzle.
An aircraft propulsion system must achieve two things. First, the thrust from
the propulsion system must balance the drag of the airplane when the airplane
is cruising. And second, the thrust from the propulsion system must exceed the
drag of the airplane for the airplane to accelerate. The greater the difference
between the thrust and the drag, called the excess thrust, the faster the
airplane will accelerate[2].
Some aircraft, like airliners and cargo planes, spend most of their life in a
cruise condition. For these airplanes, excess thrust is not as important as
high engine efficiency and low fuel usage. Since thrust depends on both the
amount of gas moved and the velocity, we can generate high thrust by
accelerating a large mass of gas by a small amount, or by accelerating a small
mass of gas by a large amount. Because of the aerodynamic efficiency of
propellers and fans, it is more fuel efficient to accelerate a large mass by a
small amount, which is why high-bypass turbofans and turboprops are commonly
used on cargo planes and airliners[2].
Some aircraft, like fighter planes or experimental high speed aircraft, require
very high excess thrust to accelerate quickly and to overcome the high drag
associated with high speeds. For these airplanes, engine efficiency is not as
important as very high thrust. Modern combat aircraft usually have an
afterburner added to a low bypass turbofan. Future hypersonic aircraft may use
some type of ramjet or rocket propulsion[2].
**** Ground[edit] ****
Wheels are commonly used in ground propulsion
Main article: Ground_propulsion
Ground propulsion is any mechanism for propelling solid bodies along the
ground, usually for the purposes of transportation. The propulsion system often
consists of a combination of an engine_or_motor, a gearbox and wheel_and_axles
in standard applications.
**** Maglev[edit] ****
Transrapid 09 at the Emsland_test_facility in Germany
Main article: Maglev
Maglev (derived from magnetic levitation) is a system of transportation that
uses magnetic_levitation to suspend, guide and propel vehicles with magnets
rather than using mechanical methods, such as wheels,_axles_and_bearings. With
maglev a vehicle is levitated a short distance away from a guide way using
magnets to create both lift and thrust. Maglev vehicles are claimed to move
more smoothly and quietly and to require less maintenance than wheeled mass
transit systems. It is claimed that non-reliance on friction also means that
acceleration and deceleration can far surpass that of existing forms of
transport. The power needed for levitation is not a particularly large
percentage of the overall energy consumption; most of the power used is needed
to overcome air resistance (drag), as with any other high-speed form of
transport.
**** Marine[edit] ****

Main article: Marine_propulsion
Marine propulsion is the mechanism or system used to generate thrust to move a
ship or boat across water. While paddles and sails are still used on some
smaller boats, most modern ships are propelled by mechanical systems consisting
a motor or engine turning a propeller, or less frequently, in jet drives, an
impeller. Marine engineering is the discipline concerned with the design of
marine propulsion_systems.
Steam_engines were the first mechanical engines used in marine propulsion, but
have mostly been replaced by two-stroke or four-stroke diesel engines, outboard
motors, and gas_turbine_engines on faster ships. Nuclear_reactors producing
steam are used to propel warships and icebreakers, and there have been attempts
to utilize them to power commercial vessels. Electric_motors have been used on
submarines and electric_boats and have been proposed for energy-efficient
propulsion.[3] Recent development in liquified natural gas (LNG) fueled engines
are gaining recognition for their low emissions and cost advantages.
**** Space[edit] ****

Mississippi
Main article: Spacecraft_propulsion
Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and
artificial satellites. There are many different methods. Each method has
drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of
research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from
the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a supersonic_de_Laval
nozzle. This sort of engine is called a rocket_engine.
All current spacecraft use chemical rockets (bipropellant or solid-fuel) for
launch, though some (such as the Pegasus_rocket and SpaceShipOne) have used
air-breathing_engines on their first_stage. Most satellites have simple
reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant_rockets) or resistojet
rockets for orbital_station-keeping and some use momentum_wheels for attitude
control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric_propulsion for decades, and
newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south
stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical
rockets as well, although a few have used ion_thrusters and Hall_effect
thrusters (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.
**** Cable[edit] ****
Main article: Cable_car_(railway)
A cable car is any of a variety of transportation systems relying on cables to
pull vehicles along or lower them at a steady rate. The terminology also refers
to the vehicles on these systems. The cable car vehicles are motor-less and
engine-less and they are pulled by a cable that is rotated by a motor off-
board.
***** Animal[edit] *****
Main article: Animal_locomotion
A bee in flight
Animal locomotion, which is the act of self-propulsion by an animal, has many
manifestations, including running, swimming, jumping and flying. Animals move
for a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, or a suitable
microhabitat, and to escape predators. For many animals the ability to move is
essential to survival and, as a result, selective pressures have shaped the
locomotion methods and mechanisms employed by moving organisms. For example,
migratory animals that travel vast distances (such as the Arctic_tern)
typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit
distance, whereas non-migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to
escape predators (such as frogs) are likely to have costly but very fast
locomotion. The study of animal locomotion is typically considered to be a sub-
field of biomechanics.
Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction, drag, inertia, and gravity,
though in many circumstances some of these factors are negligible. In
terrestrial environments gravity must be overcome, though the drag of air is
much less of an issue. In aqueous environments however, friction (or drag)
becomes the major challenge, with gravity being less of a concern. Although
animals with natural buoyancy need not expend much energy maintaining vertical
position, some will naturally sink and must expend energy to remain afloat.
Drag may also present a problem in flight, and the aerodynamically efficient
body shapes of birds highlight this point. Flight presents a different problem
from movement in water however, as there is no way for a living organism to
have lower density than air. Limbless organisms moving on land must often
contend with surface friction, but do not usually need to expend significant
energy to counteract gravity.
Newton's_third_law_of_motion is widely used in the study of animal locomotion:
if at rest, to move forward an animal must push something backward. Terrestrial
animals must push the solid ground; swimming and flying animals must push
against a fluid (either water or air).[4] The effect of forces during
locomotion on the design of the skeletal system is also important, as is the
interaction between locomotion and muscle physiology, in determining how the
structures and effectors of locomotion enable or limit animal movement.
