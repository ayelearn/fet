In physics, angular momentum (rarely, moment of momentum or rotational
momentum) is the rotational equivalent of linear_momentum. It is an important
quantity in physics because it is a conserved_quantityâthe total angular
momentum of a closed system remains constant.
In three dimensions, the angular momentum for a point_particle is a
pseudovector r Ã p, the cross_product of the particle's position_vector r
(relative to some origin) and its momentum_vector; the latter is p = mv in
Newtonian mechanics. This definition can be applied to each point in continua
like solids or fluids, or physical_fields. Unlike momentum, angular momentum
does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is
measured from it.
Just like for angular_velocity, there are two special types of angular
momentum: the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum. The spin
angular momentum of an object is defined as the angular momentum about its
centre_of_mass coordinate. The orbital angular momentum of an object about a
chosen origin is defined as the angular momentum of the centre of mass about
the origin. The total angular momentum of an object is the sum of the spin and
orbital angular momenta. The orbital angular momentum vector of a particle is
always parallel and directly proportional to the orbital angular_velocity
vector Ï of the particle, where the constant of proportionality depends on
both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin. However, the spin
angular momentum of the object is proportional but not always parallel to the
spin angular velocity Î©, making the constant of proportionality a second-rank
tensor rather than a scalar.
Angular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of any composite
system is the (pseudo) vector_sum of the angular momenta of its constituent
parts. For a continuous rigid body, the total angular momentum is the volume
integral of angular momentum density (i.e. angular momentum per unit volume in
the limit as volume shrinks to zero) over the entire body.
Torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to
force. The net external torque on any system is always equal to the total
torque on the system; in other words, the sum of all internal torques of any
system is always 0 (this is the rotational analogue of Newton's_Third_Law).
Therefore, for a closed system (where there is no net external torque), the
total torque on the system must be 0, which means that the total angular
momentum of the system is constant. The conservation of angular momentum helps
explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed
of a spinning figure_skater as the skater's arms are contracted, the high
rotational rates of neutron_stars, the Coriolis_effect, and the precession of
gyroscopes. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a
system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.
In quantum_mechanics, angular momentum (like other quantities) is expressed as
an operator, and its one-dimensional projections have quantized_eigenvalues.
Angular momentum is subject to the Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle, implying
that at any time, only one projection (also called "component") can be measured
with definite precision; the other two then remain uncertain. Because of this,
it turns out that the notion of a quantum particle literally "spinning" about
an axis does not exist. Nevertheless, elementary particles still possess a spin
angular momentum, but this angular momentum does not correspond to spinning
motion in the ordinary sense.[1]

*** Orbital angular momentum in two dimensions[edit] ***
Velocity of the particle m with respect to the origin O can be resolved into
components parallel to (vâ¥) and perpendicular to (vâ¥) the radius vector r.
The angular momentum of m is proportional to the perpendicular_component vâ¥
of the velocity, or equivalently, to the perpendicular distance râ¥ from the
origin.
Angular momentum is a vector quantity (more precisely, a pseudovector) that
represents the product of a body's rotational_inertia and rotational_velocity
(in radians/sec) about a particular axis. However, if the particle's trajectory
lies in a single plane, it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of
angular momentum, and treat it as a scalar (more precisely, a pseudoscalar).[2]
Angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of linear_momentum.
Thus, where linear_momentum     p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] is proportional to
mass     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] and linear_speed     v   {\displaystyle v}
[v],
         p = m v ,   {\displaystyle p=mv,}  [p=mv,]
angular momentum     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] is proportional to moment_of
inertia     I   {\displaystyle I}  [I] and angular_speed     &#x03C9;
{\displaystyle \omega }  [\omega ] measured in radians per second.[3]
         L = I &#x03C9; .   {\displaystyle L=I\omega .}  [L=I\omega .]
Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia is also
dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter.
Unlike linear speed, which does not depend upon the choice of origin, angular
velocity is always measured with respect to a fixed origin. Therefore, strictly
speaking,     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] should be referred to as the angular
momentum relative to that center.[4]
Because     I =  r  2   m   {\displaystyle I=r^{2}m}  [{\displaystyle I=r^
{2}m}] for a single particle and     &#x03C9; =   v r     {\displaystyle \omega
={\frac {v}{r}}}  [\omega ={\frac  {v}{r}}] for circular motion, angular
momentum can be expanded,     L =  r  2   m &#x22C5;   v r   ,   {\displaystyle
L=r^{2}m\cdot {\frac {v}{r}},}  [{\displaystyle L=r^{2}m\cdot {\frac {v}{r}},}]
and reduced to,
         L = r m v ,   {\displaystyle L=rmv,}  [{\displaystyle L=rmv,}]
the product of the radius of rotation     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] and the
linear_momentum of the particle     p = m v   {\displaystyle p=mv}  [p = mv],
where     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] in this case is the equivalent linear_
(tangential)_speed at the radius (    = r &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle =r\omega }
[{\displaystyle =r\omega }]).
This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the
component of the motion which is perpendicular to the radius_vector is
considered. In that case,
         L = r m  v  &#x22A5;   ,   {\displaystyle L=rmv_{\perp },}  [
      {\displaystyle L=rmv_{\perp },}]
where      v  &#x22A5;   = v sin &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; )   {\displaystyle v_
{\perp }=v\sin(\theta )}  [{\displaystyle v_{\perp }=v\sin(\theta )}] is the
perpendicular component of the motion. Expanding,     L = r m v sin &#x2061;
( &#x03B8; ) ,   {\displaystyle L=rmv\sin(\theta ),}  [{\displaystyle L=rmv\sin
(\theta ),}] rearranging,     L = r sin &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) m v ,
{\displaystyle L=r\sin(\theta )mv,}  [{\displaystyle L=r\sin(\theta )mv,}] and
reducing, angular momentum can also be expressed,
         L =  r  &#x22A5;   m v ,   {\displaystyle L=r_{\perp }mv,}  [
      {\displaystyle L=r_{\perp }mv,}]
where      r  &#x22A5;   = r sin &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; )   {\displaystyle r_
{\perp }=r\sin(\theta )}  [{\displaystyle r_{\perp }=r\sin(\theta )}] is the
length of the moment_arm, a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto
the path of the particle. It is this definition, (length of moment arm)Ã
(linear momentum) to which the term moment of momentum refers.[5]
*** Scalarâangular momentum from Lagrangian mechanics[edit] ***
Another approach is to define angular momentum as the conjugate momentum (also
called canonical momentum) of the angular coordinate     &#x03D5;
{\displaystyle \phi }  [\phi ] expressed in the Lagrangian of the mechanical
system. Consider a mechanical system with a mass     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m]
constrained to move in a circle of radius     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] in the
absence of any external force field. The kinetic energy of the system is
         T =   1 2   m  a  2    &#x03C9;  2   =   1 2   m  a  2       &#x03D5;
      &#x02D9;     2   .   {\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}ma^{2}\omega ^{2}=
      {\frac {1}{2}}ma^{2}{\dot {\phi }}^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle T={\frac {1}
      {2}}ma^{2}\omega ^{2}={\frac {1}{2}}ma^{2}{\dot {\phi }}^{2}.}]
And the potential energy is
         U = 0.   {\displaystyle U=0.}  [{\displaystyle U=0.}]
Then the Lagrangian is
           L    (  &#x03D5; ,    &#x03D5; &#x02D9;     )  = T &#x2212; U =   1
      2   m  a  2       &#x03D5; &#x02D9;     2   .   {\displaystyle {\mathcal
      {L}}\left(\phi ,{\dot {\phi }}\right)=T-U={\frac {1}{2}}ma^{2}{\dot {\phi
      }}^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\left(\phi ,{\dot {\phi
      }}\right)=T-U={\frac {1}{2}}ma^{2}{\dot {\phi }}^{2}.}]
The generalized momentum "canonically conjugate to" the coordinate     &#x03D5;
{\displaystyle \phi }  [\phi ] is defined by
          p  &#x03D5;   =    &#x2202;   L     &#x2202;    &#x03D5; &#x02D9;
      = m  a  2      &#x03D5; &#x02D9;    = I &#x03C9; = L .   {\displaystyle
      p_{\phi }={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial {\dot {\phi }}}}=ma^
      {2}{\dot {\phi }}=I\omega =L.}  [{\displaystyle p_{\phi }={\frac
      {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial {\dot {\phi }}}}=ma^{2}{\dot {\phi
      }}=I\omega =L.}]
*** Orbital angular momentum in three dimensions[edit] ***
Relationship between force (F), torque (Ï), momentum (p), and angular momentum
(L) vectors in a rotating system. r is the position_vector.
To completely define orbital angular momentum in three_dimensions, it is
required to know the rate at which the position vector sweeps out angle, the
direction perpendicular to the instantaneous plane of angular displacement, and
the mass involved, as well as how this mass is distributed in space[6]. By
retaining this vector nature of angular momentum, the general nature of the
equations is also retained, and can describe any sort of three-dimensional
motion about the center of rotation â circular, linear, or otherwise. In
vector_notation, the orbital angular momentum of a point_particle in motion
about the origin can be expressed as:
          L  = I  &#x03C9;  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol
      {\omega }},}  [\mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol {\omega }},]
where
               I =  r  2   m   {\displaystyle I=r^{2}m}  [{\displaystyle I=r^
            {2}m}] is the moment_of_inertia for a point_mass,
                &#x03C9;  =     r  &#x00D7;  v    r  2       {\displaystyle
            {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} }{r^
            {2}}}}  [{\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf
            {v} }{r^{2}}}] is the orbital angular_velocity in radians/sec
            (units 1/sec) of the particle about the origin,
                r    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }  [\mathbf {r} ] is the
            position_vector of the particle relative to the origin,     r =  |
            r  |    {\displaystyle r=\left\vert \mathbf {r} \right\vert }
            [r=\left\vert \mathbf {r} \right\vert ],
                v    {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }  [\mathbf {v} ] is the linear
            velocity of the particle relative to the origin, and
               m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] is the mass of the particle.
This can be expanded, reduced, and by the rules of vector_algebra, rearranged:
              L     =  (   r  2   m  )   (     r  &#x00D7;  v    r  2     )
      = m  (   r  &#x00D7;  v   )        =  r  &#x00D7; m  v        =  r
      &#x00D7;  p  ,       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {L} &=\left
      (r^{2}m\right)\left({\frac {\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} }{r^
      {2}}}\right)\\&=m\left(\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} \right)\\&=\mathbf
      {r} \times m\mathbf {v} \\&=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} ,\end
      {aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {L} &=\left(r^
      {2}m\right)\left({\frac {\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} }{r^
      {2}}}\right)\\&=m\left(\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} \right)\\&=\mathbf
      {r} \times m\mathbf {v} \\&=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} ,\end
      {aligned}}}]
which is the cross_product of the position vector      r    {\displaystyle
\mathbf {r} }  [\mathbf {r} ] and the linear momentum      p  = m  v
{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} }  [{\mathbf  {p}}=m{\mathbf  {v}}] of
the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the      L
{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }  [\mathbf {L} ] vector is perpendicular to both
r    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }  [\mathbf {r} ] and      p    {\displaystyle
\mathbf {p} }  [\mathbf {p} ]. It is directed perpendicular to the plane of
angular displacement, as indicated by the right-hand_rule â so that the
angular velocity is seen as counter-clockwise from the head of the vector.
Conversely, the      L    {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }  [\mathbf {L} ] vector
defines the plane in which      r    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }  [\mathbf {r}
] and      p    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} }  [\mathbf {p} ] lie.
By defining a unit_vector        u &#x005E;      {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat
{u}} }  [\mathbf {\hat {u}} ] perpendicular to the plane of angular
displacement, a scalar_angular_speed     &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle \omega }
[\omega ] results, where
         &#x03C9;    u &#x005E;    =  &#x03C9;  ,   {\displaystyle \omega
      \mathbf {\hat {u}} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }},}  [{\displaystyle \omega
      \mathbf {\hat {u}} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }},}] and
         &#x03C9; =    v  &#x22A5;   r   ,   {\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {v_
      {\perp }}{r}},}  [{\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {v_{\perp }}{r}},}] where
      v  &#x22A5;     {\displaystyle v_{\perp }}  [v_\perp] is the
      perpendicular component of the motion, as above.
The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given
direction:
              L     = I  &#x03C9;        = I &#x03C9;    u &#x005E;          =
      (   r  2   m  )  &#x03C9;    u &#x005E;          = r m  v  &#x22A5;
      u &#x005E;          =  r  &#x22A5;   m v    u &#x005E;    ,
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {L} &=I{\boldsymbol {\omega
      }}\\&=I\omega \mathbf {\hat {u}} \\&=\left(r^{2}m\right)\omega \mathbf
      {\hat {u}} \\&=rmv_{\perp }\mathbf {\hat {u}} \\&=r_{\perp }mv\mathbf
      {\hat {u}} ,\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {L}
      &=I{\boldsymbol {\omega }}\\&=I\omega \mathbf {\hat {u}} \\&=\left(r^
      {2}m\right)\omega \mathbf {\hat {u}} \\&=rmv_{\perp }\mathbf {\hat {u}}
      \\&=r_{\perp }mv\mathbf {\hat {u}} ,\end{aligned}}}]
and      L  = r m v    u &#x005E;      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =rmv\mathbf
{\hat {u}} }  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =rmv\mathbf {\hat {u}} }] for
circular motion, where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius     r
{\displaystyle r}  [r].
**** Discussion[edit] ****
Angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of linear_momentum.
Like linear momentum it involves elements of mass and displacement. Unlike
linear momentum it also involves elements of position and shape.
Many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in
space, be it in actual rotation about it, or simply moving past it, where it is
desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the pointâcan it exert
energy upon it or perform work about it? Energy, the ability to do work, can be
stored in matter by setting it in motionâa combination of its inertia and its
displacement. Inertia is measured by its mass, and displacement by its
velocity. Their product,
             (  amount of inertia  ) &#x00D7; (  amount of displacement  )    =
      amount of (inertia&#x22C5;displacement)       mass  &#x00D7;  velocity
      =  momentum      m &#x00D7; v    = p       {\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}({\text{amount of inertia}})\times ({\text{amount of
      displacement}})&={\text{amount of (inertiaâdisplacement)}}\\{\text
      {mass}}\times {\text{velocity}}&={\text{momentum}}\\m\times v&=p\\\end
      {aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}({\text{amount of
      inertia}})\times ({\text{amount of displacement}})&={\text{amount of
      (inertiaâdisplacement)}}\\{\text{mass}}\times {\text{velocity}}&={\text
      {momentum}}\\m\times v&=p\\\end{aligned}}}]
is the matter's momentum.[7] Referring this momentum to a central point
introduces a complication: the momentum is not applied to the point directly.
For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect,
at the end of a lever of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum
turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the
moment arm. It has the effect of multiplying the momentum's effort in
proportion to its length, an effect known as a moment. Hence, the particle's
momentum referred to a particular point,
             (  moment arm  ) &#x00D7; (  amount of inertia  ) &#x00D7;
      (  amount of displacement  )    =  moment of
      (inertia&#x22C5;displacement)       length  &#x00D7;  mass  &#x00D7;
      velocity     =  moment of momentum      r &#x00D7; m &#x00D7; v    = L
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}({\text{moment arm}})\times ({\text{amount

is the angular momentum, sometimes called, as here, the moment of momentum of
the particle versus that particular center point. The equation     L = r m v
{\displaystyle L=rmv}  [L=rmv] combines a moment (a mass     m   {\displaystyle
m}  [m] turning moment arm     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r]) with a linear
(straight-line equivalent) speed     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v]. Linear speed
referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance     r
{\displaystyle r}  [r] and the angular speed     &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle
\omega }  [\omega ] versus the point:     v = r &#x03C9; ,   {\displaystyle
v=r\omega ,}  [v=r\omega ,] another moment. Hence, angular momentum contains a
double moment:     L = r m r &#x03C9; .   {\displaystyle L=rmr\omega .}
[L=rmr\omega .] Simplifying slightly,     L =  r  2   m &#x03C9; ,
{\displaystyle L=r^{2}m\omega ,}  [L=r^{2}m\omega ,] the quantity      r  2   m
{\displaystyle r^{2}m}  [r^{2}m] is the particle's moment_of_inertia, sometimes
called the second moment of mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.[8]
Moment_of_inertia (shown here), and therefore angular momentum, is different
for every possible configuration of mass and axis_of_rotation.
Because moment_of_inertia is a crucial part of the spin angular momentum, the
latter necessarily includes all of the complications of the former, which is
calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the squares of their
distances from the center of rotation.[9] Therefore, the total moment of
inertia, and the angular momentum, is a complex function of the configuration
of the matter about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation
for the various bits.
For a rigid_body, for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of
rotation is simply the position of the rotation_axis versus the matter of the
body. It may or may not pass through the center_of_mass, or it may lie
completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may take a
different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place.
[10] It reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of mass.[11]
For a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of the
bodies of the Solar_System, the orientations may be somewhat organized, as is
the Solar System, with most of the bodies' axes lying close to the system's
axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.
In brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation (the
longer the moment_arm), the greater the moment of inertia, and therefore the
greater the angular momentum for a given angular_velocity. In many cases the
moment_of_inertia, and hence the angular momentum, can be simplified by,[12]
         I =  k  2   m ,   {\displaystyle I=k^{2}m,}  [I=k^{2}m,]
      where     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] is the radius_of_gyration, the
      distance from the axis at which the entire mass     m   {\displaystyle m}
      [m] may be considered as concentrated.
Similarly, for a point_mass     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] the moment_of
inertia is defined as,
         I =  r  2   m   {\displaystyle I=r^{2}m}  [I=r^{2}m]
      where     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] is the radius of the point mass from
      the center of rotation,
and for any collection of particles      m  i     {\displaystyle m_{i}}  [m_
{i}] as the sum,
          &#x2211;  i    I  i   =  &#x2211;  i    r  i   2    m  i
      {\displaystyle \sum _{i}I_{i}=\sum _{i}r_{i}^{2}m_{i}}  [\sum _{i}I_
      {i}=\sum _{i}r_{i}^{2}m_{i}]
Angular momentum's dependence on position and shape is reflected in its units
versus linear momentum: kgâm2/s, Nâmâs, or Jâs for angular momentum
versus kgâm/s or Nâs for linear momentum. When calculating angular momentum
as the product of the moment of inertia times the angular velocity, the angular
velocity must be expressed in radians per second, where the radian assumes the
dimensionless value of unity. (When performing dimensional analysis, it may be
productive to use orientational_analysis which treats radians as a base unit,
but this is outside the scope of the International_system_of_units). Angular
momentum's units can be interpreted as torqueâtime or as energyâtime per
angle. An object with angular momentum of L Nâmâs can be reduced to zero
rotation (all of the rotational energy can be transferred out of it) by an
angular impulse of L Nâmâs[13] or equivalently, by torque or work of L
Nâm for one second, or energy of L J for one second.[14]
The plane perpendicular to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the
center of mass[15] is sometimes called the invariable plane, because the
direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies
within the system, free from outside influences, are considered.[16] One such
plane is the invariable_plane_of_the_Solar_System.
*** Angular momentum and torque[edit] ***
See also: Torque_Â§ Definition_and_relation_to_angular_momentum
Newton's_second_law_of_motion can be expressed mathematically,
          F  = m  a  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} ,}  [\mathbf
      {F} =m\mathbf {a} ,]
or force = mass Ã acceleration. The rotational equivalent for point particles
may be derived as follows:
          L  = I  &#x03C9;    {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol {\omega
      }}}  [\mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol {\omega }}]
which means that the torque (i.e. the time derivative of the angular momentum)
is
          &#x03C4;  =    d I   d t     &#x03C9;  + I    d  &#x03C9;    d t    .
      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}={\frac {dI}{dt}}{\boldsymbol {\omega
      }}+I{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}.}  [{\displaystyle
      {\boldsymbol {\tau }}={\frac {dI}{dt}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}+I{\frac {d
      {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}.}]
Because the moment of inertia is     m  r  2     {\displaystyle mr^{2}}  [mr^
{2}], it follows that        d I   d t    = 2 m r    d r   d t    = 2 r  p   |
|      {\displaystyle {\frac {dI}{dt}}=2mr{\frac {dr}{dt}}=2rp_{||}}  [
{\displaystyle {\frac {dI}{dt}}=2mr{\frac {dr}{dt}}=2rp_{||}}], and        d  L
d t    = I    d  &#x03C9;    d t    + 2 r  p   |   |     &#x03C9;  ,
{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}=I{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}
{dt}}+2rp_{||}{\boldsymbol {\omega }},}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} }
{dt}}=I{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}+2rp_{||}{\boldsymbol {\omega
}},}] which, reduces to
          &#x03C4;  = I  &#x03B1;  + 2 r  p   |   |     &#x03C9;  .
      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}+2rp_{||}
      {\boldsymbol {\omega }}.}  [{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=I
      {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}+2rp_{||}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}.}]
This is the rotational analog of Newton's Second Law. Note that the torque is
not necessarily proportional or parallel to the angular acceleration (as one
might expect). The reason for this is that the moment of inertia of a particle
can change with time, something that cannot occur for ordinary mass.
**** Conservation of angular momentum[edit] ****
A figure_skater conserves angular momentum â her rotational_speed increases
as her moment_of_inertia decreases by drawing in her arms and legs.
A rotational analog of Newton's_third_law_of_motion might be written, "In a
closed_system, no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on
some other matter of an equal and opposite torque."[17] Hence, angular momentum
can be exchanged between objects in a closed system, but total angular momentum
before and after an exchange remains constant (is conserved).[18]
Seen another way, a rotational analogue of Newton's_first_law_of_motion might
be written, "A rigid body continues in a state of uniform rotation unless acted
by an external influence."[17] Thus with no external influence to act upon it,
the original angular momentum of the system remains constant.[19]
The conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing central_force_motion.
If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the center,
then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the
force is directed along the radius_vector, and none is perpendicular to the
radius. Mathematically, torque      &#x03C4;  =  r  &#x00D7;  F  =  0  ,
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} =\mathbf
{0} ,}  [{\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} =\mathbf {0} ,]
because in this case      r    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }  [\mathbf {r} ] and
F    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }  [\mathbf {F} ] are parallel vectors.
Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This
is the case with gravitational_attraction in the orbits of planets and
satellites, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary
body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and
velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in
the analysis of the Bohr_model of the atom.
For a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet
and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various
mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the EarthâMoon_system
results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to tidal
torque the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down
of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,[20] and in
gradual increase of the radius of Moon's orbit, at about 3.82 centimeters per
year.[21]
The torque caused by the two opposing forces Fg and âFg causes a change in
the angular momentum L in the direction of that torque (since torque is the
time derivative of angular momentum). This causes the top to precess.
The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an
ice_skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of
rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis, she
decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product
of moment_of_inertia and angular_velocity, if the angular momentum remains
constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the
skater must increase.
The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like white
dwarfs, neutron_stars and black_holes) when they are formed out of much larger
and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object n times results in
increase of its angular velocity by the factor of n2.
Conservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but
is a key constraint. For example, a spinning top is subject to gravitational
torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation
axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a
conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its
precession axis. Also, in any planetary_system, the planets, star(s), comets,
and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the
angular momentum of the system is conserved.
Noether's_theorem states that every conservation_law is associated with a
symmetry (invariant) of the underlying physics. The symmetry associated with
conservation of angular momentum is rotational_invariance. The fact that the
physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis
implies that angular momentum is conserved.[22]
**** Angular momentum in orbital mechanics[edit] ****
Main article: Specific_relative_angular_momentum
In astrodynamics and celestial_mechanics, a massless (or per unit mass) angular
momentum is defined[23]
          h  =  r  &#x00D7;  v  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {h} =\mathbf {r}
      \times \mathbf {v} ,}  [\mathbf {h} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} ,]
called specific_angular_momentum. Note that      L  = m  h  .   {\displaystyle
\mathbf {L} =m\mathbf {h} .}  [\mathbf {L} =m\mathbf {h} .] Mass is often
unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations, because motion is defined by
gravity. The primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies
in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational
effect on it; it is, in effect, stationary. All bodies are apparently attracted
by its gravity in the same way, regardless of mass, and therefore all move
approximately the same way under the same conditions.
**** Solid bodies[edit] ****
For a continuous mass distribution with density function Ï(r), a differential
volume_element dV with position_vector r within the mass has a mass element dm
= Ï(r)dV. Therefore, the infinitesimal angular momentum of this element is:
         d  L  =  r  &#x00D7; d m  v  =  r  &#x00D7; &#x03C1; (  r  ) d V  v  =
      d V  r  &#x00D7; &#x03C1; (  r  )  v    {\displaystyle d\mathbf {L}
      =\mathbf {r} \times dm\mathbf {v} =\mathbf {r} \times \rho (\mathbf {r}
      )dV\mathbf {v} =dV\mathbf {r} \times \rho (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {v} }
      [d\mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times dm\mathbf {v} =\mathbf {r} \times \rho
      (\mathbf {r} )dV\mathbf {v} =dV\mathbf {r} \times \rho (\mathbf {r}
      )\mathbf {v} ]
and integrating this differential over the volume of the entire mass gives its
total angular momentum:
          L  =  &#x222B;  V   d V  r  &#x00D7; &#x03C1; (  r  )  v
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\int _{V}dV\mathbf {r} \times \rho (\mathbf
      {r} )\mathbf {v} }  [\mathbf {L} =\int _{V}dV\mathbf {r} \times \rho
      (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {v} ]
In the derivation which follows, integrals similar to this can replace the sums
for the case of continuous mass.
**** Collection of particles[edit] ****
*** Center of mass[edit] ***
The angular momentum of the particles i is the sum of the cross products R Ã
MV + Î£ri Ã mivi.
For a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin, it is
informative to develop the equation of angular momentum by resolving their
motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin.
Given,
          m  i     {\displaystyle m_{i}}  [m_{i}] is the mass of particle     i
      {\displaystyle i}  [i],
           R   i     {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} _{i}}  [\mathbf {R} _{i}] is
      the position vector of particle     i   {\displaystyle i}  [i] vs the
      origin,
           V   i     {\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{i}}  [\mathbf {V} _{i}] is
      the velocity of particle     i   {\displaystyle i}  [i] vs the origin,
          R    {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} }  [\mathbf {R} ] is the position
      vector of the center of mass vs the origin,
          V    {\displaystyle \mathbf {V} }  [\mathbf {V} ] is the velocity of
      the center of mass vs the origin,
           r   i     {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{i}}  [\mathbf {r} _{i}] is
      the position vector of particle     i   {\displaystyle i}  [i] vs the
      center of mass,
           v   i     {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{i}}  [\mathbf {v} _{i}] is
      the velocity of particle     i   {\displaystyle i}  [i] vs the center of
      mass,
The total mass of the particles is simply their sum,
         M =  &#x2211;  i    m  i   .   {\displaystyle M=\sum _{i}m_{i}.}
      [M=\sum _{i}m_{i}.]
The position vector of the center of mass is defined by,[24]
         M  R  =  &#x2211;  i    m  i     R   i   .   {\displaystyle M\mathbf
      {R} =\sum _{i}m_{i}\mathbf {R} _{i}.}  [M\mathbf {R} =\sum _{i}m_
      {i}\mathbf {R} _{i}.]
By inspection,
           R   i   =  R  +   r   i     {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} _{i}=\mathbf
      {R} +\mathbf {r} _{i}}  [\mathbf {R} _{i}=\mathbf {R} +\mathbf {r} _{i}]
      and       V   i   =  V  +   v   i   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _
      {i}=\mathbf {V} +\mathbf {v} _{i}.}  [\mathbf {V} _{i}=\mathbf {V}
      +\mathbf {v} _{i}.]
The total angular momentum of the collection of particles is the sum of the
angular momentum of each particle,
    L  =  &#x2211;  i    (    R   i   &#x00D7;  m  i     V   i    )

The first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to the
origin. Similar to Single_particle, below, it is the angular momentum of one
particle of mass M at the center of mass moving with velocity V. The second
term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of
mass, similar to Fixed_center_of_mass, below. The result is generalâthe
motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the
origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can
be elements of a continuous distribution, such as a solid body.

and grouping appropriately,

***** Angular momentum (modern definition)[edit] *****
The 3-angular momentum as a bivector (plane element) and axial_vector, of a
particle of mass m with instantaneous 3-position x and 3-momentum p.
In modern (20th century) theoretical physics, angular momentum (not including
any intrinsic angular momentum â see below) is described using a different
formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, angular
momentum is the 2-form Noether_charge associated with rotational invariance. As
a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general curved_spacetimes,
unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.[citation_needed]
In classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted
as a plane element:
          L  =  r  &#x2227;  p   ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r}
      \wedge \mathbf {p} \,,}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \wedge
      \mathbf {p} \,,}]
in which the exterior_product â§ replaces the cross_product Ã (these products
have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the advantage of
a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the x and p
vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or
higher). In Cartesian coordinates:
              L     =  (  x  p  y   &#x2212; y  p  x    )    e   x   &#x2227;
      e   y   +  (  y  p  z   &#x2212; z  p  y    )    e   y   &#x2227;   e   z
      +  (  z  p  x   &#x2212; x  p  z    )    e   z   &#x2227;   e   x
      =  L  x y     e   x   &#x2227;   e   y   +  L  y z     e   y   &#x2227;
      e   z   +  L  z x     e   z   &#x2227;   e   x    ,       {\displaystyle
      {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {L} &=\left(xp_{y}-yp_{x}\right)\mathbf {e} _
      {x}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{y}+\left(yp_{z}-zp_{y}\right)\mathbf {e} _

      {z}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{x}\\&=L_{xy}\mathbf {e} _{x}\wedge \mathbf {e} _
      {y}+L_{yz}\mathbf {e} _{y}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{z}+L_{zx}\mathbf {e} _
      {z}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{x}\,,\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin

      {e} _{z}+\left(zp_{x}-xp_{z}\right)\mathbf {e} _{z}\wedge \mathbf {e} _

      {y}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{z}+L_{zx}\mathbf {e} _{z}\wedge \mathbf {e} _
      {x}\,,\end{aligned}}}]
or more compactly in index notation:
          L  i j   =  x  i    p  j   &#x2212;  x  j    p  i    .
      {\displaystyle L_{ij}=x_{i}p_{j}-x_{j}p_{i}\,.}  [{\displaystyle L_
      {ij}=x_{i}p_{j}-x_{j}p_{i}\,.}]
The angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order
tensor, with components Ïij. The relation between the two antisymmetric
tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order
tensor:[26]
          L  i j   =  I  i j k &#x2113;    &#x03C9;  k &#x2113;    .
      {\displaystyle L_{ij}=I_{ijk\ell }\omega _{k\ell }\,.}  [L_{ij}=I_
      {ijk\ell }\omega _{k\ell }\,.]
Again, this equation in L and Ï as tensors is true in any number of
dimensions. This equation also appears in the geometric_algebra formalism, in
which L and Ï are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between
them.
In relativistic_mechanics, the relativistic_angular_momentum of a particle is
expressed as an antisymmetric_tensor of second order:
          M  &#x03B1; &#x03B2;   =  X  &#x03B1;    P  &#x03B2;   &#x2212;  X
      &#x03B2;    P  &#x03B1;     {\displaystyle M_{\alpha \beta }=X_{\alpha
      }P_{\beta }-X_{\beta }P_{\alpha }}  [{\displaystyle M_{\alpha \beta }=X_
      {\alpha }P_{\beta }-X_{\beta }P_{\alpha }}]
in the language of four-vectors, namely the four_position X and the four
momentum P, and absorbs the above L together with the motion of the centre_of
mass of the particle.
In each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular
momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the
centre of mass is for the system.
***** In quantum mechanics[edit] *****
Main article: Angular_momentum_operator
Angular momentum in quantum_mechanics differs in many profound respects from
angular momentum in classical_mechanics. In relativistic_quantum_mechanics, it
differs even more, in which the above relativistic definition becomes a
tensorial operator.
**** Spin, orbital, and total angular momentum[edit] ****
Main article: Spin_(physics)
Angular momenta of a classical object.
    * Left: "spin" angular momentum S is really orbital angular momentum of the
      object at every point.
    * Right: extrinsic orbital angular momentum L about an axis.
    * Top: the moment_of_inertia_tensor I and angular_velocity Ï (L is not
      always parallel to Ï).[27]
    * Bottom: momentum p and its radial position r from the axis. The total
      angular momentum (spin plus orbital) is J. For a quantum particle the
      interpretations are different; particle_spin does not have the above
      interpretation.
The classical definition of angular momentum as      L  =  r  &#x00D7;  p
{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} }  [{\displaystyle
\mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} }] can be carried over to quantum
mechanics, by reinterpreting r as the quantum position_operator and p as the
quantum momentum_operator. L is then an operator, specifically called the
orbital_angular_momentum_operator. The components of the angular momentum
operator satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3). Indeed,
these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on
the quantum Hilbert space.[28] (See also the discussion below of the angular
momentum operators as the generators of rotations.)
However, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called
spin_angular_momentum, represented by the spin operator S. Almost all
elementary_particles have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally
spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin
is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in
space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All elementary
particles have a characteristic spin, for example electrons have "spin 1/2"
(this actually means "spin Ä§/2") while photons have "spin 1" (this actually
means "spin Ä§").
Finally, there is total_angular_momentum J, which combines both the spin and
orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, J = L
+ S.) Conservation_of_angular_momentum applies to J, but not to L or S; for
example, the spinâorbit_interaction allows angular momentum to transfer back
and forth between L and S, with the total remaining constant. Electrons and
photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum, but can
also have fractional values.[29]
**** Quantization[edit] ****
In quantum_mechanics, angular momentum is quantized â that is, it cannot vary
continuously, but only in "quantum_leaps" between certain allowed values. For
any system, the following restrictions on measurement results apply, where
&#x210F;   {\displaystyle \hbar }  [\hbar ] is the reduced_Planck_constant and
n &#x005E;      {\displaystyle {\hat {n}}}  [{\hat {n}}] is any Euclidean
vector such as x, y, or z:

In this standing_wave on a circular string, the circle is broken into exactly 8
wavelengths. A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of
wavelengths around the circle, but it cannot have a non-integer number of
wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a
similar reason.
(There are additional restrictions as well, see angular_momentum_operator for
details.)
The reduced_Planck_constant     &#x210F;   {\displaystyle \hbar }  [\hbar ] is
tiny by everyday standards, about 10â34 J_s, and therefore this quantization
does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects.
However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the
structure of electron_shells and subshells in chemistry is significantly
affected by the quantization of angular momentum.
Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by Niels_Bohr in his Bohr
model of the atom and was later predicted by Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger in his
SchrÃ¶dinger_equation.

{\displaystyle p_{x}}  [p_{x}],      p  y     {\displaystyle p_{y}}  [p_{y}],
p  z     {\displaystyle p_{z}}  [p_{z}]. However, the Heisenberg_uncertainty
principle tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to
be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits
to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns
out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular
momentum vector's magnitude and its component along one axis.
The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an
angular_momentum_operator do not commute, for example      L  x    L  y
&#x2260;  L  y    L  x     {\displaystyle L_{x}L_{y}\neq L_{y}L_{x}}  [L_{x}L_
{y}\neq L_{y}L_{x}]. (For the precise commutation_relations, see angular
momentum_operator.)
**** Total angular momentum as generator of rotations[edit] ****
As mentioned above, orbital angular momentum L is defined as in classical
mechanics:      L  =  r  &#x00D7;  p    {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r}
\times \mathbf {p} }  [\mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} ], but total
angular momentum J is defined in a different, more basic way: J is defined as
the "generator of rotations".[30] More specifically, J is defined so that the
operator
         R (    n &#x005E;    , &#x03D5; ) &#x2261; exp &#x2061;  (  &#x2212;
      i &#x210F;   &#x03D5;   J  &#x22C5;     n  &#x005E;     )
      {\displaystyle R({\hat {n}},\phi )\equiv \exp \left(-{\frac {i}{\hbar
      }}\phi \,\mathbf {J} \cdot {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}\right)}  [R({\hat
      {n}},\phi )\equiv \exp \left(-{\frac {i}{\hbar }}\phi \,\mathbf {J} \cdot
      {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}\right)]
is the rotation_operator that takes any system and rotates it by angle
&#x03D5;   {\displaystyle \phi }  [\phi ] about the axis         n  &#x005E;
{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}}  [{\hat {\mathbf {n} }}]. (The "exp" in
the formula refers to operator_exponential) To put this the other way around,
whatever our quantum Hilbert space is, we expect that the rotation_group_SO(3)
will act on it. There is then an associated action of the Lie algebra so(3) of
SO(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our Hilbert space are
the (total) angular momentum operators.
The relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation
operators is the same as the relationship between Lie_algebras and Lie_groups
in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations
is reflected in Noether's_theorem that proves that angular momentum is
conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.
***** In electrodynamics[edit] *****
See also: Momentum_(Particle_in_field)
When describing the motion of a charged_particle in an electromagnetic_field,
the canonical_momentum P (derived from the Lagrangian for this system) is not
gauge_invariant. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum L = r Ã P is
not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-
called kinetic momentum (used throughout this article), is (in SI_units)
          p  = m  v  =  P  &#x2212; e  A    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p}
      =m\mathbf {v} =\mathbf {P} -e\mathbf {A} }  [\mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v}
      =\mathbf {P} -e\mathbf {A} ]
where e is the electric_charge of the particle and A the magnetic_vector
potential of the electromagnetic field. The gauge-invariant angular momentum,
that is kinetic angular momentum, is given by
          K  =  r  &#x00D7; (  P  &#x2212; e  A  )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {K}
      =\mathbf {r} \times (\mathbf {P} -e\mathbf {A} )}  [\mathbf {K} =\mathbf
      {r} \times (\mathbf {P} -e\mathbf {A} )]
The interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on
canonical_commutation_relations.
***** In optics[edit] *****
In classical Maxwell electrodynamics the Poynting_vector is a linear momentum
density of electromagnetic field.[31]
          S  (  r  , t ) =  &#x03F5;  0    c  2    E  (  r  , t ) &#x00D7;  B
      (  r  , t ) .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {S} (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\epsilon _
      {0}c^{2}\mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} ,t)\times \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ,t).}
      [{\displaystyle \mathbf {S} (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\epsilon _{0}c^{2}\mathbf
      {E} (\mathbf {r} ,t)\times \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ,t).}]
The angular momentum density vector      L  (  r  , t )   {\displaystyle
\mathbf {L} (\mathbf {r} ,t)}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} (\mathbf {r} ,t)}]
is given by a vector product as in classical mechanics:[32]
          L  (  r  , t ) =  r  &#x00D7;  S  (  r  , t ) .   {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {L} (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {S} (\mathbf {r}
      ,t).}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\mathbf {r} \times
      \mathbf {S} (\mathbf {r} ,t).}]
The above identities are valid locally, i.e. in each space point      r
{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }  [\mathbf {r} ] in a given moment     t
{\displaystyle t}  [t].
***** History[edit] *****
Newton, in the Principia, hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the
First_Law_of_Motion,
      A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from
      rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is
      retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets,
      meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions
      both progressive and circular for a much longer time.[33]
He did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the Principia,
      From such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of
      bodies about their own centres. But these are cases which I do not
      consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demonstrate
      every particular that relates to this subject.[34]
However, his geometric proof of the law_of_areas is an outstanding example of
Newton's genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the
case of a central_force.
**** The Law of Areas[edit] ****
Main articles: Classical_central-force_problem and Areal_velocity
*** Newton's derivation[edit] ***
Newton's derivation of the area law using geometric means.
As a planet orbits the Sun, the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps out
equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since Kepler
expounded his second_law_of_planetary_motion. Newton derived a unique geometric
proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's gravity was
the cause of all of Kepler's laws.
During the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point A to point
B. Undisturbed, it would continue to point c during the second interval. When
the object arrives at B, it receives an impulse directed toward point S. The
impulse gives it a small added velocity toward S, such that if this were its
only velocity, it would move from B to V during the second interval. By the
rules_of_velocity_composition, these two velocities add, and point C is found
by construction of parallelogram BcCV. Thus the object's path is deflected by
the impulse so that it arrives at point C at the end of the second interval.
Because the triangles SBc and SBC have the same base SB and the same height Bc
or VC, they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle SBc also has the same
area as triangle SAB, therefore the object has swept out equal areas SAB and
SBC in equal times.
At point C, the object receives another impulse toward S, again deflecting its
path during the third interval from d to D. Thus it continues to E and beyond,
the triangles SAB, SBc, SBC, SCd, SCD, SDe, SDE all having the same area.
Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path ABCDE approaches
indefinitely close to a continuous curve.
Note that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is
applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's second law of planetary
motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive
or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.
*** Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas[edit] ***
The proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving
object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is,
the lines from S to the object, are equivalent to the radius_r, and that the
heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of
velocity_vâ¥. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the
triangular area formula 1/2(base)(height), the product (base)(height) and
therefore the product rvâ¥ are constant: if r and the base length are
decreased, vâ¥ and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant,
therefore angular_momentum_rmvâ¥ is conserved by this exchange of distance and
velocity.
In the case of triangle SBC, area is equal to 1/2(SB)(VC). Wherever C is
eventually located due to the impulse applied at B, the product (SB)(VC), and
therefore rmvâ¥ remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.
**** After Newton[edit] ****
Leonhard_Euler, Daniel_Bernoulli, and Patrick_d'Arcy all understood angular
momentum in terms of conservation of areal_velocity, a result of their analysis
of Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized
the implications for ordinary rotating matter.[35]
In 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular
momentum in his Mechanica without further developing them.[36]
Bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a "moment of rotational motion", possibly
the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.[37]
In 1799, Pierre-Simon_Laplace first realized that a fixed plane was associated
with rotation â his invariable_plane.
Louis_Poinsot in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment
perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the "conservation of moments".
In 1852 LÃ©on_Foucault used a gyroscope in an experiment to display the Earth's
rotation.
William_J._M._Rankine's 1858 Manual of Applied Mechanics defined angular
momentum in the modern sense for the first time:
      ...a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular
      momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of
      the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the
      body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the
      body seems to have right-handed rotation.
In an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that "The term angular
momentum was introduced by Mr. Hayward,"[38] probably referring to R.B.
Hayward's article On a Direct Method of estimating Velocities, Accelerations,
and all similar Quantities with respect to Axes moveable in any manner in Space
with Applications,[39] which was introduced in 1856, and published in 1864.
Rankine was mistaken, as numerous publications feature the term starting in the
late 18th to early 19th centuries.[40] However, Hayward's article apparently
was the first use of the term and the concept seen by much of the English-
speaking world. Before this, angular momentum was typically referred to as
"momentum of rotation" in English.[41]
