For the pump component, see Pump_inducer.
In molecular_biology, an inducer is a molecule that regulates gene_expression.
[1] An inducer can bind to protein repressors or activators.
Inducers function by disabling repressors. The gene is expressed because an
inducer binds to the repressor. The binding of the inducer to the repressor
prevents the repressor from binding to the operator. RNA_polymerase can then
begin to transcribe operon genes.
Inducers also function by binding to activators. Activators generally bind
poorly to activator_DNA_sequences unless an inducer is present. Activator binds
to an inducer and the complex binds to the activation sequence and activates
target gene.[2] Removing the inducer stops transcription.[2]
Because a small inducer molecule is required, the increased expression of the
target gene is called induction.[2] The lactose operon is one example of an
inducible system.[2]

***** Function[edit] *****
Repressor proteins bind to the DNA strand and prevent RNA polymerase from being
able to attach to the DNA and synthesize mRNA. Inducers bind to repressors,
causing them to change shape and preventing them from binding to DNA.
Therefore, they allow transcription, and thus gene expression, to take place.
For a gene to be expressed, its DNA sequence must be copied (in a process known
as transcription) to make a smaller, mobile molecule called messenger_RNA
(mRNA), which carries the instructions for making a protein to the site where
the protein is manufactured (in a process known as translation). Many different
types of proteins can affect the level of gene expression by promoting or
preventing transcription. In prokaryotes (such as bacteria), these proteins
often act on a portion of DNA known as the operator at the beginning of the
gene. The promoter is where RNA_polymerase, the enzyme that copies the genetic
sequence and synthesizes the mRNA, attaches to the DNA strand.
Some genes are modulated by activators, which have the opposite effect on gene
expression as repressors. Inducers can also bind to activator proteins,
allowing them to bind to the operator DNA where they promote RNA transcription.
Ligands that bind to deactivate activator proteins are not, in the technical
sense, classified as inducers, since they have the effect of preventing
transcription.
***** Examples[edit] *****
**** lac operon[edit] ****
The inducer in the lac_operon is allolactose.[2] If lactose is present in the
medium, then a small amount of it will be converted to allolactose by a few
molecules of Î²-galactosidase that are present in the cell.[3] Allolactose
binds to the repressor and decreases the repressor's affinity for the operator
site.[3]
However, when lactose and glucose are both available in the system, the lac
operon is repressed. This is because glucose actively prevents the induction of
lacZYA.[2]
**** ara operon[edit] ****
In the ara_operon, arabinose is the inducer.
***** Potency[edit] *****
Index inducer or just inducer predictably induce metabolism via a given pathway
and are commonly used in prospective clinical drug-drug_interaction studies.[4]
Strong, moderate, and weak inducers are drugs that decreases the AUC of
sensitive_index_substrates of a given metabolic pathway by â¥80%, â¥50% to
<80%, and â¥20% to <50%, respectively.[4]
