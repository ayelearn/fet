Aerodynamics, from Greek á¼Î®Ï aer (air) + Î´ÏÎ½Î±Î¼Î¹ÎºÎ® (dynamics), is
the study of motion of air, particularly as interaction with a solid object,
such as an airplane wing. It is a sub-field of fluid_dynamics and gas_dynamics,
and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. The term
aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being
that "gas dynamics" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not
limited to air. The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in
the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as
aerodynamic_drag were recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in
aerodynamics were directed toward achieving heavier-than-air_flight, which was
first demonstrated by Otto_Lilienthal in 1891.[1] Since then, the use of
aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind
tunnel experimentation, and computer_simulations has formed a rational basis
for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other
technologies. Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to
compressible_flow, turbulence, and boundary_layers and has become increasingly
computational in nature.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_aerodynamics
Modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century, but aerodynamic
forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and
windmills,[2] and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded
history,[3] such as the Ancient_Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus.[4]
Fundamental concepts of continuum, drag, and pressure_gradients appear in the
work of Aristotle and Archimedes.[5]
In 1726, Sir_Isaac_Newton became the first person to develop a theory of air
resistance,[6] making him one of the first aerodynamicists. Dutch-Swiss
mathematician Daniel_Bernoulli followed in 1738 with Hydrodynamica in which he
described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow
velocity for incompressible flow known today as Bernoulli's_principle, which
provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift.[7] In 1757, Leonhard
Euler published the more general Euler_equations which could be applied to both
compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to
incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting
in the NavierâStokes_equations.[8][9] The Navier-Stokes equations are the
most general governing equations of fluid flow and but are difficult to solve
for the flow around all but the simplest of shapes.
A replica of the Wright_brothers' wind_tunnel is on display at the Virginia Air
and Space Center. Wind tunnels were key in the development and validation of
the laws of aerodynamics.
In 1799, Sir_George_Cayley became the first person to identify the four
aerodynamic forces of flight (weight, lift, drag, and thrust), as well as the
relationships between them,[10][11] and in doing so outlined the path toward
achieving heavier-than-air flight for the next century. In 1871, Francis
Herbert_Wenham constructed the first wind_tunnel, allowing precise measurements
of aerodynamic forces. Drag theories were developed by Jean_le_Rond_d'Alembert,
[12] Gustav_Kirchhoff,[13] and Lord_Rayleigh.[14] In 1889, Charles_Renard, a
French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the
power needed for sustained flight.[15] Otto_Lilienthal, the first person to
become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose
thin, curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag. Building on
these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel,
the Wright_brothers flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.
During the time of the first flights, Frederick_W._Lanchester,[16] Martin
Kutta, and Nikolai_Zhukovsky independently created theories that connected
circulation of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a
two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, Ludwig
Prandtl is credited with developing the mathematics[17] behind thin-airfoil and
lifting-line theories as well as work with boundary_layers.
As aircraft speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated
with air compressibility at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound. The
differences in air flows under such conditions leads to problems in aircraft
control, increased drag due to shock_waves, and the threat of structural
failure due to aeroelastic_flutter. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of
sound was named the Mach_number after Ernst_Mach who was one of the first to
investigate the properties of supersonic flow. William_John_Macquorn_Rankine
and Pierre_Henri_Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow
properties before and after a shock_wave, while Jakob_Ackeret led the initial
work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.[18] Theodore_von
KÃ¡rmÃ¡n and Hugh_Latimer_Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow
speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag
led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was
achievable until the sound_barrier was broken for the first time in 1947 using
the Bell_X-1 aircraft.
By the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the
subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The Cold_War prompted the design
of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. Computational_fluid
dynamics began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects
and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using
computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm
the computer predictions. Understanding of supersonic and hypersonic
aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have
shifted from the behavior of fluid flow to the engineering of a vehicle such
that it interacts pedictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for
supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the
aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to
motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on
important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and
the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes
equations.
***** Fundamental concepts[edit] *****
Forces of flight on an airfoil
Understanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field)
enables the calculation of forces and moments acting on the object. In many
aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of
flight: lift, drag, thrust, and weight. Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic
forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body. Calculation of these
quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as
a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as flow
velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, which may be functions of
position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in
aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for
conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in air flows. Density, flow
velocity, and an additional property, viscosity, are used to classify flow
fields.
**** Flow classification[edit] ****
Flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic
flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local
speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and
regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound.
Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater
than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow,
refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.
Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.
Compressible_flow accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows
are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be
constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations
that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate
results.
Viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow
fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely
neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows
for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally,
aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External
aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g.
around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow
through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).
*** Continuum assumption[edit] ***
Unlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete molecules which
occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular
level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas
molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most
aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored,
and the flow field is assumed to behave as a continuum. This assumption allows
fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere
within the flow.
The validity of the continuum_assumption is dependent on the density of the gas
and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the
mean_free_path length must be much smaller than the length scale of the
application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with
aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is
on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger.
In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a
few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For
such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum
assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those
encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000 ft/90 km)[5] or
satellites in Low_Earth_orbit. In those cases, statistical_mechanics is a more
accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The
Knudsen_number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics
and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.
**** Conservation laws[edit] ****
The assumption of a fluid_continuum allows problems in aerodynamics to be
solved using fluid_dynamics_conservation_laws. Three conservation principles
are used:
   1. Conservation_of_mass: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of
      this principle is known as the mass_continuity_equation, which requires
      that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow of interest.
   2. Conservation_of_momentum: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation
      of this principle can be considered an application of Newton's_Second
      Law. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the
      system by external forces, which may include both surface_forces, such as
      viscous (frictional) forces, and body_forces, such as weight. The
      momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a vector
      equation or separated into a set of three scalar equations (x,y,z
      components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation
      equations are known as the Navier-Stokes_equations. The Navier-Stokes
      equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern
      aerodynamics using computational_techniques. Because of the computational
      cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of
      momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The
      Euler_equations are a set of momentum conservation equations which
      neglect viscous forces and may be used in cases where the effect of
      viscous forces is expected to be small. Additionally, Bernoulli's
      equation is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an
      inviscid flow that neglects gravity.
   3. Conservation_of_energy: The energy conservation equation states that
      energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any
      addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by
      the fluid flow, by heat_transfer, or by work into and out of the region
      of interest.
The ideal_gas_law or another such equation_of_state is often used in
conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the
solution for the unknown variables.
***** Branches of aerodynamics[edit] *****
Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of
the flow, including flow_speed, compressibility, and viscosity. External
aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes.
Evaluating the lift and drag on an airplane or the shock_waves that form in
front of the nose of a rocket are examples of external aerodynamics. Internal
aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For
instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a
jet_engine or through an air_conditioning pipe.
Aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the flow_speed
is below, near or above the speed_of_sound. A problem is called subsonic if all
the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, transonic if speeds
both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the
characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), supersonic when the
characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and hypersonic
when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists
disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition
considers flows with Mach_numbers above 5 to be hypersonic.[5]
The influence of viscosity on the flow dictates a third classification. Some
problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity
can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are
called inviscid_flows. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called
viscous flows.
**** Incompressible aerodynamics[edit] ****
Further information: incompressible_flow
An incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and
space. Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated
as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes
to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds
are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are
more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound. The Mach
number is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed,
otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.
*** Subsonic flow[edit] ***
Subsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are
much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several
branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is
inviscid, incompressible and irrotational. This case is called potential_flow
and allows the differential_equations that describe the flow to be a simplified
version of the equations of fluid_dynamics, thus making available to the
aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.[19]
In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is
whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a
description of the amount of change of density in the flow. When the effects of
compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is
constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed
aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called
compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the Mach
number in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102 m) per second or
228 miles (366 km) per hour at 60 Â°F (16 Â°C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem
flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.
**** Compressible aerodynamics[edit] ****
Main article: Compressible_flow
According to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be
compressible if the density changes along a streamline. This means that â
unlike incompressible flow â changes in density are considered. In general,
this is the case where the Mach_number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3.
The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a
Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%.
Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the stagnation_point (the
point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around
the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and
hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.
*** Transonic flow[edit] ***
Main article: Transonic
The term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above
the local speed_of_sound (generally taken as Mach 0.8â1.2). It is defined as
the range of speeds between the critical_Mach_number, when some parts of the
airflow over an aircraft become supersonic, and a higher speed, typically near
Mach_1.2, when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of
the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.
*** Supersonic flow[edit] ***
Main article: Supersonic
Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than
the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the Concorde during cruise can be
an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.
Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to
differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is "told" to respond
to its environment. Therefore, since sound is, in fact, an infinitesimal
pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the speed_of_sound in that
fluid can be considered the fastest speed that "information" can travel in the
flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid
striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a stagnation
pressure as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid
traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream,
changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that
the fluid "knows" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and
is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow, however, the pressure disturbance
cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it
strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties â temperature,
density, pressure, and Mach_numberâin an extremely violent and irreversible
fashion called a shock_wave. The presence of shock waves, along with the
compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see Reynolds_number) fluids, is
the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics
regimes.
*** Hypersonic flow[edit] ***
Main article: Hypersonic
In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In
the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the
speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic
regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a
shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.
***** Associated terminology[edit] *****
Different types flow analysis around an airfoil:
  Potential_flow theory
  Boundary_layer_flow theory
  Turbulent_wake analysis
The incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated
phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.
**** Boundary layers[edit] ****
Main article: Boundary_layer
The concept of a boundary_layer is important in many problems in aerodynamics.
The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being
significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of
such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.
**** Turbulence[edit] ****
Main article: Turbulence
In aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the
flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid
variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not
turbulent is called laminar_flow.

piping, and in automotive_engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect
the performance of the engine.
