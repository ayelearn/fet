****** Kutta condition ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The Kutta condition is a principle in steady-flow fluid_dynamics, especially
aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as
the trailing_edges of airfoils. It is named for German mathematician and
aerodynamicist Martin_Kutta.
Kuethe and Schetzer state the Kutta condition as follows:[1]:Â§ 4.11
      A body with a sharp trailing edge which is moving through a fluid will
      create about itself a circulation of sufficient strength to hold the rear
      stagnation point at the trailing edge.
In fluid flow around a body with a sharp corner, the Kutta condition refers to
the flow pattern in which fluid approaches the corner from both directions,
meets at the corner, and then flows away from the body. None of the fluid flows
around the sharp corner.
The Kutta condition is significant when using the KuttaâJoukowski_theorem to
calculate the lift created by an airfoil with a sharp trailing edge. The value
of circulation of the flow around the airfoil must be that value which would
cause the Kutta condition to exist.

***** The Kutta condition applied to airfoils[edit] *****
Applying 2-D potential flow, if an airfoil with a sharp trailing edge begins to
move with an angle of attack through air, the two stagnation points are
initially located on the underside near the leading edge and on the topside
near the trailing edge, just as with the cylinder. As the air passing the
underside of the airfoil reaches the trailing edge it must flow around the
trailing edge and along the topside of the airfoil toward the stagnation point
on the topside of the airfoil. Vortex flow occurs at the trailing edge and,
because the radius of the sharp trailing edge is zero, the speed of the air
around the trailing edge should be infinitely fast. Though real fluids cannot
move at infinite speed, they can move very fast. The high airspeed around the
trailing edge causes strong viscous forces to act on the air adjacent to the
trailing edge of the airfoil and the result is that a strong vortex accumulates
on the topside of the airfoil, near the trailing edge. As the airfoil begins to
move it carries this vortex, known as the starting_vortex, along with it.
Pioneering aerodynamicists were able to photograph starting vortices in liquids
to confirm their existence.[2][3][4]
The vorticity in the starting vortex is matched by the vorticity in the bound
vortex in the airfoil, in accordance with Kelvin's_circulation_theorem.[1]:Â§
2.14 As the vorticity in the starting vortex progressively increases the
vorticity in the bound vortex also progressively increases and causes the flow
over the topside of the airfoil to increase in speed. The starting vortex is
soon cast off the airfoil and is left behind, spinning in the air where the
airfoil left it. The stagnation point on the topside of the airfoil then moves
until it reaches the trailing edge.[1]:Â§Â§ 6.2, 6.3 The starting vortex
eventually dissipates due to viscous forces.
As the airfoil continues on its way, there is a stagnation point at the
trailing edge. The flow over the topside conforms to the upper surface of the
airfoil. The flow over both the topside and the underside join up at the
trailing edge and leave the airfoil travelling parallel to one another. This is
known as the Kutta condition.[5]:Â§ 4.8
When an airfoil is moving with an angle of attack, the starting vortex has been
cast off and the Kutta condition has become established, there is a finite
circulation of the air around the airfoil. The airfoil is generating lift, and
the magnitude of the lift is given by the KuttaâJoukowski_theorem.[5]:Â§ 4.5
One of the consequences of the Kutta condition is that the airflow over the
topside of the airfoil travels much faster than the airflow under the
underside. A parcel of air which approaches the airfoil along the stagnation
streamline is cleaved in two at the stagnation point, one half traveling over
the topside and the other half traveling along the underside. The flow over the
topside is so much faster than the flow along the underside that these two
halves never meet again. They do not even re-join in the wake long after the
airfoil has passed. This is sometimes known as "cleavage". There is a popular
fallacy called the equal_transit-time_fallacy that claims the two halves rejoin
at the trailing edge of the airfoil. This fallacy is in conflict with the
phenomenon of cleavage that has been understood since Martin Kutta's discovery.
Whenever the speed or angle of attack of an airfoil changes there is a weak
starting vortex which begins to form, either above or below the trailing edge.
This weak starting vortex causes the Kutta condition to be re-established for
the new speed or angle of attack. As a result, the circulation around the
airfoil changes and so too does the lift in response to the changed speed or
angle of attack.[6][5]:Â§ 4.7-4.9
The Kutta condition gives some insight into why airfoils usually have sharp
trailing edges, even though this is undesirable from structural and
manufacturing viewpoints.
In irrotational, inviscid, incompressible flow (potential flow) over an
airfoil, the Kutta condition can be implemented by calculating the stream
function over the airfoil surface.[7] [8] The same Kutta condition
implementation method is also used for solving two dimensional subsonic
(subcritical) inviscid steady compressible flows over isolated airfoils.[9] The
viscous correction for the Kutta condition can be found in some of the recent
studies.[10]
***** The Kutta condition in aerodynamics[edit] *****
The Kutta condition allows an aerodynamicist to incorporate a significant
effect of viscosity while neglecting viscous effects in the underlying
conservation_of_momentum equation. It is important in the practical calculation
of lift on a wing.
The equations of conservation_of_mass and conservation_of_momentum applied to
an inviscid fluid flow, such as a potential_flow, around a solid body result in
an infinite number of valid solutions. One way to choose the correct solution
would be to apply the viscous equations, in the form of the NavierâStokes
equations. However, these normally do not result in a closed-form solution. The
Kutta condition is an alternative method of incorporating some aspects of
viscous effects, while neglecting others, such as skin_friction and some other
boundary_layer effects.
The condition can be expressed in a number of ways. One is that there cannot be
an infinite change in velocity at the trailing edge. Although an inviscid_fluid
can have abrupt changes in velocity, in reality viscosity smooths out sharp
velocity changes. If the trailing edge has a non-zero angle, the flow velocity
there must be zero. At a cusped trailing edge, however, the velocity can be
non-zero although it must still be identical above and below the airfoil.
Another formulation is that the pressure must be continuous at the trailing
edge.
The Kutta condition does not apply to unsteady flow. Experimental observations
show that the stagnation_point (one of two points on the surface of an airfoil
where the flow speed is zero) begins on the top surface of an airfoil (assuming
positive effective angle_of_attack) as flow accelerates from zero, and moves
backwards as the flow accelerates. Once the initial transient effects have died
out, the stagnation point is at the trailing edge as required by the Kutta
condition.
Mathematically, the Kutta condition enforces a specific choice among the
infinite allowed values of circulation.
