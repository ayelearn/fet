From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Immune tolerance, or immunological tolerance, or immunotolerance, is a state of
unresponsiveness of the immune system to substances or tissue that have the
capacity to elicit an immune response in given organism. It is induced by prior
exposure to that specific antigen[1][2] and contrasts with conventional immune-
mediated elimination of foreign antigens (see Immune_response). Tolerance is
classified into central_tolerance or peripheral_tolerance depending on where
the state is originally inducedâin the thymus and bone_marrow (central) or in
other tissues and lymph_nodes (peripheral). The mechanisms by which these forms
of tolerance are established are distinct, but the resulting effect is similar.
Immune tolerance is important for normal physiology. Central tolerance is the
main way the immune system learns to discriminate self from non-self.
Peripheral tolerance is key to preventing over-reactivity of the immune system
to various environmental entities (allergens, gut_microbes, etc.). Deficits in
central or peripheral tolerance also cause autoimmune_disease, resulting in
syndromes such as systemic_lupus_erythematosus,[3] rheumatoid_arthritis, type_1
diabetes,[4] autoimmune_polyendocrine_syndrome_type_1 (APS-1),[5] and
immunodysregulation_polyendocrinopathy_enteropathy_X-linked_syndrome (IPEX),[6]
and potentially contribute to asthma, allergy,[7] and inflammatory_bowel
disease.[4] And immune_tolerance_in_pregnancy is what allows a mother animal to
gestate a genetically distinct offspring with an alloimmune response muted
enough to prevent miscarriage.
Tolerance, however, also has its negative tradeoffs. It allows for some
pathogenic microbes to successfully infect a host and avoid elimination.[8] In
addition, inducing peripheral tolerance in the local microenvironment is a
common survival strategy for a number of tumors that prevents their elimination
by the host immune system.[9]

***** Historical background[edit] *****
The phenomenon of immune tolerance was first described by Ray D. Owens in 1945,
who noted that dizygotic twin cattle sharing a common placenta also shared a
stable mixture of each other's red blood cells (though not necessarily 50/50),
and retained that mixture throughout life.[1] Although Owens did not use the
term immune tolerance, his study showed the body could be tolerant of these
foreign tissues. This observation was experimentally validated by Rupert E.
Billingham and Peter Medawar in 1953, who showed by injecting foreign cells
into fetal or neonatal mice, they could become accepting of future grafts from
the same foreign donor. However, they were not thinking of the immunological
consequences of their work at the time: as Medawar explains:
      "We did not set out with the idea in mind of studying the immunological
      consequences of the phenomenon described by Owen; on the contrary, we had
      been goaded by Dr. H.P. Donald into trying to devise a foolproof method
      of distinguishing monozygotic from dizygotic twins... ."[1]
However, these discoveries, and the host of allograft experiments and
observations of twin chimerism they inspired, were seminal for the theories of
immune tolerance formulated by Sir_Frank_McFarlane_Burnet and Frank_Fenner, who
were the first to propose the deletion of self-reactive lymphocytes to
establish tolerance, now termed clonal_deletion.[10] Burnet and Medawar were
ultimately credited for "the discovery of acquired immune tolerance" and shared
the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1960.[1]
***** Definitions and usage[edit] *****
In their Nobel Lecture, Medawar and Burnet define immune tolerance as "a state
of indifference or non-reactivity towards a substance that would normally be
expected to excite an immunological response."[1] Other more recent definitions
have remained more or less the same. The 8th edition of Janeway's Immunobiology
defines tolerance as "immunologically unresponsiveâ¦to another's tissues.".[2]
Immune tolerance encompasses the range of physiological mechanisms by which the
body reduces or eliminates an immune response to particular agents. It is used
to describe the phenomenon underlying discrimination of self from non-self,
suppressing allergic responses, allowing chronic infection instead of rejection
and elimination, and preventing attack of fetuses by the maternal immune
system. Typically, a change in the host, not the antigen, is implied.[1] Though
some pathogens can evolve to become less virulent in host-pathogen coevolution,
[11] tolerance does not refer to the change in the pathogen, but can be used to
describe the changes in host physiology. Immune tolerance also does not usually
refer to artificially induced immunosuppression by corticosteroids, lymphotoxic
chemotherapy agents, sublethal irradiation, etc. Nor does it refer to other
types of non-reactivity such as immunological paralysis.[12] In the latter two
cases, the host's physiology is handicapped but not fundamentally changed.
Immune tolerance is formally differentiated into central or peripheral;[2]
however, alternative terms such as "natural" or "acquired" tolerance have at
times been used to refer to establishment of tolerance by physiological means
or by artificial, experimental, or pharmacological means.[13] These two methods
of categorization are sometimes confused, but are not equivalentâcentral or
peripheral tolerance may be present naturally or induced experimentally. This
difference is important to keep in mind.
***** Central tolerance[edit] *****
Central_tolerance refers to the tolerance established by deleting autoreactive
lymphocyte clones before they develop into fully immunocompetent cells. It
occurs during lymphocyte development in the thymus[14][15] and bone_marrow for
T and B_lymphocytes, respectively. In these tissues, maturing lymphocytes are
exposed to self-antigens presented by medullary thymic epithelial cells and
thymic dendritic cells, or bone marrow cells. Self-antigens are present due to
endogenous expression, importation of antigen from peripheral sites via
circulating blood, and in the case of thymic stromal cells, expression of
proteins of other non-thymic tissues by the action of the transcription factor
AIRE.
Those lymphocytes that have receptors that bind strongly to self-antigens are
removed by induction of apoptosis of the autoreactive cells, or by induction of
anergy, a state of non-activity.[16] Weakly autoreactive B cells may also
remain in a state of immunological ignorance where they simply do not respond
to stimulation of their B cell receptor. Some weakly self-recognizing T cells
are alternatively differentiated into natural regulatory_T_cells (nTreg cells),
which act as sentinels in the periphery to calm down potential instances of T
cell autoreactivity (see peripheral_tolerance below).[2]
The deletion threshold is much more stringent for T cells than for B cells
since T cells alone can cause direct tissue damage. Furthermore, it is more
advantageous for the organism to let its B cells recognize a wider variety of
antigen so it can produce antibodies against a greater diversity of pathogens.
Since the B cells can only be fully activated after confirmation by more self-
restricted T cells that recognize the same antigen, autoreactivity is held in
check.[16]
This process of negative selection ensures that T and B cells that could
initiate a potent immune response to the host's own tissues are eliminated
while preserving the ability to recognize foreign antigens. It is the step in
lymphocyte education that is key for preventing autoimmunity (entire process
detailed here). Lymphocyte development and education is most active in fetal
development, but continues throughout life as immature lymphocytes are
generated, slowing as the thymus degenerates and the bone marrow shrinks in
adult life.
***** Peripheral tolerance[edit] *****
Peripheral_tolerance develops after T and B cells mature and enter the
peripheral tissues and lymph nodes.[2] It is established by a number of partly
overlapping mechanisms that mostly involve control at the level of T cells,
especially CD4+ helper T cells, which orchestrate immune responses and give B
cells the confirmatory signals they need in order to produce antibodies.
Inappropriate reactivity toward normal self-antigen that was not eliminated in
the thymus can occur, since the T cells that leave the thymus are relatively
but not completely safe. Some will have receptors (TCRs) that can respond to
self-antigens that:
    * are present in such high concentration outside the thymus that they can
      bind to "weak" receptors.
    * the T cell did not encounter in the thymus (such as, tissue-specific
      molecules like those in the islets_of_Langerhans, brain, or spinal cord
      not expressed by AIRE in thymic tissues).
Those self-reactive T cells that escape intrathymic negative selection in the
thymus can inflict cell injury unless they are deleted or effectively muzzled
in the peripheral tissue chiefly by nTreg cells (see central_tolerance above).
Appropriate reactivity toward certain antigens can also be quieted by induction
of tolerance after repeated exposure, or exposure in a certain context. In
these cases, there is a differentiation of naÃ¯ve CD4+ helper T cells into
induced Treg_cells (iTreg cells) in the peripheral tissue or nearby lymphoid
tissue (lymph nodes, mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue, etc.). This
differentiation is mediated by IL-2 produced upon T cell activation, and TGF-Î²
from any of a variety of sources, including tolerizing dendritic_cells (DCs),
other antigen_presenting_cells, or in certain conditions surrounding tissue.[8]
Treg_cells are not the only cells that mediate peripheral tolerance. Other
regulatory immune cells include T cell subsets similar to but phenotypically
distinct from Treg cells, including TR1_cells that make IL-10 but do not
express Foxp3, TGF-Î²-secreting TH3 cells, as well as other less well-
characterized cells that help establish a local tolerogenic environment.[17] B
cells also express CD22, a non-specific inhibitor receptor that dampens B cell
receptor activation. A subset of B regulatory cells that makes IL-10 and TGF-Î²
also exists.[18] Some DCs can make Indoleamine_2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that
depletes the amino acid tryptophan needed by T cells to proliferate and thus
reduce responsiveness. DCs also have the capacity to directly induce anergy in
T cells that recognize antigen expressed at high levels and thus presented at
steady-state by DCs.[19] In addition, FasL expression by immune_privileged
tissues can result in activation-induced_cell_death of T cells.[20]
**** nTreg vs. iTreg cells[edit] ****
The involvement of T cells, later classified as Treg_cells, in immune tolerance
was recognized in 1995 when animal models showed that CD4+ CD25+ T cells were
necessary and sufficient for the prevention of autoimmunity in mice and rats.
[17] Initial observations showed removal of the thymus of a newborn mouse
resulted in autoimmunity, which could be rescued by transplantation of CD4+ T
cells. A more specific depletion and reconstitution experiment established the
phenotype of these cells as CD4+ and CD25+. Later in 2003, experiments showed
that Treg cells were characterized by the expression of the Foxp3 transcription
factor, which is responsible for the suppressive phenotype of these cells.[17]
It was assumed that, since the presence of the Treg cells originally
characterized was dependent on the neonatal thymus, these cells were thymically
derived. By the mid-2000s, however, evidence was accruing of conversion of
naÃ¯ve CD4+ T cells to Treg cells outside of the thymus.[8] These were later
defined as induced or iTreg cells to contrast them with thymus-derived nTreg
cells. Both types of Treg cells quieten autoreactive T cell signaling and
proliferation by cell-contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms including:
[21]
    * Contact-dependent:
          * Granzyme or perforin secretion upon contact
          * Upregulation of cAMP after contact, inducing anergy (reduced
            proliferation and IL-2 signaling)
          * Interaction with B7 on T cells
          * Downregulation of CD80/CD86 costimultory molecules on antigen
            presenting_cells upon interaction with CTLA-4 or lymphocyte
            function-associated_antigen_1 (LFA-1)
    * Contact-independent
          * Secretion of TGF-Î², which sensitizes cells to suppression and
            promotes Treg-like cell differentiation
          * Secretion of IL-10
          * Cytokine absorption leading to cytokine deprivation-mediated
            apoptosis
nTreg cells and iTreg cells, however, have a few important distinguishing
characteristics that suggest they have different physiological roles:[8]
    * nTreg cells develop in the thymus; iTreg cells develop outside the thymus
      in chronically inflamed tissue, lymph_nodes, spleen, and gut-associated
      lymphoid_tissue (GALT).
    * nTreg cells develop from Foxp3- CD25+ CD4+ cells while iTreg cells
      develop from Foxp3+ CD25- CD4- cells (both become Foxp3+ CD25+CD4+).
    * nTreg cells, when activated, require CD28 costimulation, while iTreg
      cells require CTLA-4 costimulation.
    * nTreg cells are specific, modestly, for self-antigen while iTreg cells
      recognize allergens, commensal bacteria, tumor antigens, alloantigens,
      and self-antigens in inflamed tissue.
***** Tolerance in physiology and medicine[edit] *****
**** Allograft tolerance[edit] ****
Immune recognition of non-self-antigens typically complicates transplantation
and engrafting of foreign tissue from an organism of the same species
(allografts), resulting in graft reaction. However, there are two general cases
in which an allograft may be accepted. One is when cells or tissue are grafted
to an immune-privileged site that is sequestered from immune surveillance (like
in the eye or testes) or has strong molecular signals in place to prevent
dangerous inflammation (like in the brain). The second is when a state of
tolerance has been induced, either by previous exposure to the antigen of the
donor in a manner that causes immune tolerance rather than sensitization in the
recipient, or after chronic rejection. Long-term exposure to a foreign antigen
from fetal development or birth may result in establishment of central
tolerance, as was observed in Medawar's mouse-allograft experiments.[1] In
usual transplant cases, however, such early prior exposure is not possible.
Nonetheless, a few patients can still develop allograft tolerance upon
cessation of all exogenous immunosuppressive therapy, a condition referred to
as operational tolerance.[22][23] CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg cells, as well as CD8+ CD28-
regulatory T cells that dampen cytotoxic responses to grafted organs, are
thought to play a role.[16] In addition, genes involved in NK_cell and Î³Î´T
cell function associated with tolerance have been implicated for liver
transplant patients.[23] The unique gene_signatures of these patients implies
their physiology may be predisposed toward immune tolerance.
**** Fetal development[edit] ****
The fetus has a different genetic makeup than the mother, as it also translates
its father's genes, and is thus perceived as foreign by the maternal immune
system. Women who have borne multiple children by the same father typically
have antibodies against the father's red blood cell and major
histocompatibility_complex (MHC) proteins.[2] However, the fetus usually is not
rejected by the mother, making it essentially a physiologically tolerated
allograft. It is thought that the placental tissues which interface with
maternal tissues not only try to escape immunological recognition by
downregulating identifying MHC proteins but also actively induce a marked
peripheral tolerance. Placental trophoblast cells express a unique Human
Leukocyte_Antigen (HLA-G) that inhibits attack by maternal NK_cells. These
cells also express IDO, which represses maternal T cell responses by amino acid
starvation. Maternal T cells specific for paternal antigens are also suppressed
by tolerogenic DCs and activated iTregs or cross-reacting nTregs.[24] Some
maternal Treg cells also release soluble fibrinogen-like_proteins_2 (sFGL2),
which suppresses the function of DCs and macrophages involved in inflammation
and antigen_presentation to reactive T cells[24] These mechanisms altogether
establish an immune-privileged state in the placenta that protects the fetus. A
break in this peripheral tolerance results in miscarriage and fetal loss.[25]
(for more information, see Immune_tolerance_in_pregnancy).
**** The microbiome[edit] ****
The skin and digestive tract of humans and many other organisms is colonized
with an ecosystem of microorganisms that is referred to as the microbiome.
Though in mammals a number of defenses exist to keep the microbiota at a safe
distance, including a constant sampling and presentation of microbial antigens
by local DCs, most organisms do not react against commensal microorganisms and
tolerate their presence. Reactions are mounted, however, to pathogenic microbes
and microbes that breach physiological barriers. Peripheral mucosal immune
tolerance, in particular mediated by iTreg cells and tolerogenic antigen-
presenting cells, is thought to be responsible for this phenomenon. In
particular, specialized gut CD103+ DCs that produce both TGF-Î² and retinoic
acid efficiently promotes the differentiation of iTreg cells in the gut
lymphoid tissue.[8] Foxp3- TR1 cells that make IL-10 are also enriched in the
intestinal lining.[2] Break in this tolerance is thought to underlie the
pathogenesis of inflammatory_bowel_diseases like Crohn's_disease and ulcerative
colitis.[4]
**** Oral tolerance and hypersensitivity[edit] ****
See also: Goblet_cell_Â§ Role_in_oral_tolerance
Oral tolerance refers to a specific type of peripheral tolerance induced by
antigens given by mouth and exposed to the gut mucosa and its_associated
lymphoid_tissues.[13] The hypo-responsiveness induced by oral exposure is
systemic, and can reduce hypersensitivity reactions in certain cases. Records
from 1829 indicate that American Indians would reduce contact hypersensitivity
from poison ivy by consuming leaves of related Rhus species; however,
contemporary attempts to use oral tolerance to ameliorate autoimmune diseases
like rheumatoid arthritis and other hypersensitivity reactions have been mixed.
[13] The systemic effects of oral tolerance may be explained by the extensive
recirculation of immune cells primed in one mucosal tissue in another mucosal
tissue, allowing extension of mucosal immunity.[26] The same probably occurs
for cells mediating mucosal immune tolerance.
Oral tolerance may depend on the same mechanisms of peripheral tolerance that
limit inflammation to bacterial antigens in the microbiome, since both involve
the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. It may also have evolved to prevent
hypersensitivity reactions to food proteins.[27] It is of immense immunological
importance, since it is a continuous natural immunologic event driven by
exogenous antigen.
Allergy and hypersensitivity_reactions in general are traditionally thought of
as misguided or excessive reactions by the immune system, possibly due to
broken or underdeveloped mechanisms of peripheral tolerance. Usually, Treg
cells, TR1, and Th3_cells at mucosal surfaces suppress type_2_CD4_helper_cells,
mast_cells, and eosinophils, which mediate allergic response. Deficits in Treg
cells or their localization to mucosa have been implicated in asthma and atopic
dermatitis.[28] Attempts have been made to reduce hypersensitivity reactions by
oral tolerance and other means of repeated exposure. Repeated administration of
the allergen in slowly increasing doses, subcutaneously or sublingually appears
to be effective for allergic rhinitis.[29] Repeated administration of
antibiotics, which can form haptens to cause allergic reactions, can also
reduce antibiotic allergies in children.[30]
**** The tumor microenvironment[edit] ****
Immune tolerance is an important means by which growing tumors, which have
mutated proteins and altered antigen expression, prevent elimination by the
host immune system. It is well recognized that tumors are a complex and dynamic
population of cells composed of transformed cells as well as stromal_cells,
blood vessels, tissue macrophages, and other immune infiltrates.[9][31] These
cells and their interactions all contribute to the changing tumor
microenvironment, which the tumor largely manipulates to be immunotolerant so
as to avoid elimination. There is an accumulation of metabolic enzymes that
suppress T cell proliferation and activation, including IDO and arginase, and
high expression of tolerance-inducing ligands like FasL, PD-1, CTLA-4, and B7.
[9][20] Pharmacologic monoclonal antibodies targeted against some of these
ligands has been effective in treating cancer.[32] Tumor-derived vesicles known
as exosomes have also been implicated promoting differentiation of iTreg cells
and myeloid_derived_suppressor_cells (MDSCs), which also induce peripheral
tolerance.[9][33] In addition to promoting immune tolerance, other aspects of
the microenvironment aid in immune evasion and induction of tumor-promoting
inflammation.
***** Evolution[edit] *****
Though the exact evolutionary rationale behind the development of immunological
tolerance is not completely known, it is thought to allow organisms to adapt to
antigenic stimuli that will consistently be present instead of expending
considerable resources fighting it off repeatedly. Tolerance in general can be
thought of as an alternative defense strategy that focuses on minimizing impact
of an invader on host fitness, instead of on destroying and eliminating the
invader.[34] Such efforts may have a prohibitive cost on host fitness. In
plants, where the concept was originally used, tolerance is defined as a
reaction_norm of host fitness over a range of parasite burdens, and can be
measured from the slope of the line fitting these data.[35] Immune tolerance
may constitute one aspect of this defense strategy, though other types of
tissue tolerance have been described.[34]
Schematic of the reaction norm of tolerance (after[35]). Organisms of genotype
2 are considered more tolerant to the pathogen than organisms of genotype 1.
The advantages of immune tolerance in particular may be seen in experiments
with mice infected with malaria, in which more tolerant mice have higher
fitness at greater pathogen burdens. In addition, development of immune
tolerance would have allowed organisms to reap the benefits of having a robust
commensal microbiome, such as increased nutrient absorption and decreased
colonization by pathogenic bacteria.
Though it seems that the existence of tolerance is mostly adaptive, allowing an
adjustment of the immune response to a level appropriate for the given
stressor, it comes with important evolutionary disadvantages. Some infectious
microbes take advantage of existing mechanisms of tolerance to avoid detection
and/or elimination by the host immune system. Induction of regulatory_T_cells,
for instance, has been noted in infections with Helicobacter_pylori, Listeria
monocytogenes, Brugia_malayi, and other worms and parasites.[8] Another
important disadvantage of the existence of tolerance may be susceptibility to
cancer progression. Treg cells inhibit anti-tumor NK_cells.[36] The injection
of Treg cells specific for a tumor antigen also can reverse experimentally-
mediated tumor rejection based on that same antigen.[37] The prior existence of
immune tolerance mechanisms due to selection for its fitness benefits
facilitates its utilization in tumor growth.
**** Tradeoffs between immune tolerance and resistance[edit] ****
Immune tolerance contrasts with resistance. Upon exposure to a foreign antigen,
either the antigen is eliminated by the standard immune response (resistance),
or the immune system adapts to the pathogen, promoting immune tolerance
instead.
Resistance typically protects the host at the expense of the parasite, while
tolerance reduces harm to the host without having any direct negative effects
on the parasite.[35] Each strategy has its unique costs and benefits for host
fitness:[34]
                         Costs                      Benefits
                             * Pain, swelling, and
                               disruption of tissue
                               function by
                               inflammation.            * Reduces pathogen
                             * Tissue damage by           burden

                               (immunopathology)          dangerous organisms
                             * High energy cost         * Prevents parasitism
                             * Risk of
                               autoimmunity,
                               hypersensitivity,
                               allergy
                                                        * Reduced tissue damage
                             * Direct damage by           from immune response
                               pathogen (toxins,        * Less selection
Tolerance                      digestion, etc.)           pressure on pathogens
                             * Energy and resources       for resistance
                               lost to pathogen         * Promotes commensalism
                                                        * Lower energy cost
Evolution works to optimize host fitness, so whether elimination or tolerance
occurs depends on which would benefit the organism most in a given scenario. If
the antigen is from a rare, dangerous invader, the costs of tolerating its
presence are high and it is more beneficial to the host to eliminate it.
Conversely, if experience (of the organism or its ancestors) has showed that
the antigen is innocuous, then it would be more beneficial to tolerate the
presence of the antigen rather than pay the costs of inflammation.
Despite having mechanisms for both immune resistance and tolerance, any one
organism may be overall more skewed toward a tolerant or resistant phenotype
depending on individual variation in both traits due to genetic and
environmental factors.[35] In mice infected with malaria, different genetic
strains of mice fall neatly along a spectrum of being more tolerant but less
resistant or more resistant but less tolerant.[38] Patients with autoimmune
diseases also often have a unique gene signature and certain environmental risk
factors that predispose them to disease.[2] This may have implications for
current efforts to identify why certain individuals may be disposed to or
protected against autoimmunity, allergy, inflammatory_bowel_disease, and other
such diseases.
