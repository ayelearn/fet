Autoimmunity
Specialty Immunology
Autoimmunity is the system of immune responses of an organism against its own
healthy cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant
immune response is termed an "autoimmune_disease". Prominent examples include
celiac_disease, diabetes_mellitus_type_1, sarcoidosis, systemic_lupus
erythematosus (SLE), SjÃ¶gren's_syndrome, eosinophilic_granulomatosis_with
polyangiitis, Hashimoto's_thyroiditis, Graves'_disease, idiopathic
thrombocytopenic_purpura, Addison's_disease, rheumatoid_arthritis (RA),
ankylosing_spondylitis, polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and multiple
sclerosis (MS). Autoimmune diseases are very often treated with steroids.[1]

***** History[edit] *****
In the later 19th century it was believed that the immune system was unable to
react against the body's own tissues. Paul_Ehrlich, at the turn of the 20th
century, proposed the concept of horror autotoxicus. Ehrlich later adjusted his
theory to recognize the possibility of autoimmune tissue attacks, but believed
certain innate protection mechanisms would prevent the autoimmune response from
becoming pathological.
In 1904 this theory was challenged by the discovery of a substance in the serum
of patients with paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria that reacted with red blood
cells. During the following decades, a number of conditions could be linked to
autoimmune responses. However, the authoritative status of Ehrlich's postulate
hampered the understanding of these findings. Immunology became a biochemical
rather than a clinical discipline.[2] By the 1950s the modern understanding of
autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases started to spread.
More recently it has become accepted that autoimmune responses are an integral
part of vertebrate_immune_systems (sometimes termed "natural autoimmunity").[3]
Autoimmunity should not be confused with alloimmunity.
***** Low-level autoimmunity[edit] *****
While a high level of autoimmunity is unhealthy, a low level of autoimmunity
may actually be beneficial. Taking the experience of a beneficial factor in
autoimmunity further, one might hypothesize with intent to prove that
autoimmunity is always a self-defense mechanism of the mammal system to
survive. The system does not randomly lose the ability to distinguish between
self and non-self, the attack on cells may be the consequence of cycling
metabolic processes necessary to keep the blood chemistry in homeostasis.
Second, autoimmunity may have a role in allowing a rapid immune response in the
early stages of an infection when the availability of foreign antigens limits
the response (i.e., when there are few pathogens present). In their study,
Stefanova et al. (2002) injected an anti-MHC_Class_II antibody into mice
expressing a single type of MHC Class II molecule (H-2b) to temporarily prevent
CD4+ T cell-MHC interaction. Naive CD4+_T_cells (those that have not
encountered any antigens before) recovered from these mice 36 hours post-anti-
MHC administration showed decreased responsiveness to the antigen pigeon
cytochrome_C peptide, as determined by Zap-70 phosphorylation, proliferation,
and Interleukin-2 production. Thus Stefanova et al. (2002) demonstrated that
self-MHC recognition (which, if too strong may contribute to autoimmune
disease) maintains the responsiveness of CD4+ T cells when foreign antigens are
absent.[4]
***** Immunological tolerance[edit] *****
Pioneering work by Noel_Rose and Ernst_Witebsky in New York, and Roitt and
Doniach at University_College_London provided clear evidence that, at least in
terms of antibody-producing B cells (B lymphocytes), diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis and thyrotoxicosis are associated with loss of
immunological_tolerance, which is the ability of an individual to ignore
"self", while reacting to "non-self". This breakage leads to the immune
system's mounting an effective and specific immune response against self
determinants. The exact genesis of immunological tolerance is still elusive,
but several theories have been proposed since the mid-twentieth century to
explain its origin.
Three hypotheses have gained widespread attention among immunologists:
    * Clonal_Deletion theory, proposed by Burnet, according to which self-
      reactive lymphoid cells are destroyed during the development of the
      immune system in an individual. For their work Frank M. Burnet and Peter
      B. Medawar were awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
      "for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance".
    * Clonal Anergy theory, proposed by Nossal, in which self-reactive T- or B-
      cells become inactivated in the normal individual and cannot amplify the
      immune response.[5]
    * Idiotype Network theory, proposed by Jerne, wherein a network of
      antibodies capable of neutralizing self-reactive antibodies exists
      naturally within the body.[6]
In addition, two other theories are under intense investigation:
    * Clonal Ignorance theory, according to which autoreactive T cells that are
      not represented in the thymus will mature and migrate to the periphery,
      where they will not encounter the appropriate antigen because it is
      inaccessible tissues. Consequently, auto-reactive B cells, that escape
      deletion, cannot find the antigen or the specific helper T cell.[7]
    * Suppressor population or Regulatory_T_cell theory, wherein regulatory T-
      lymphocytes (commonly CD4+FoxP3+ cells, among others) function to
      prevent, downregulate, or limit autoaggressive immune responses in the
      immune system.
Tolerance can also be differentiated into "Central" and "Peripheral" tolerance,
on whether or not the above-stated checking mechanisms operate in the central
lymphoid organs (Thymus and Bone Marrow) or the peripheral lymphoid organs
(lymph node, spleen, etc., where self-reactive B-cells may be destroyed). It
must be emphasised that these theories are not mutually exclusive, and evidence
has been mounting suggesting that all of these mechanisms may actively
contribute to vertebrate immunological tolerance.
A puzzling feature of the documented loss of tolerance seen in spontaneous
human autoimmunity is that it is almost entirely restricted to the autoantibody
responses produced by B lymphocytes. Loss of tolerance by T cells has been
extremely hard to demonstrate, and where there is evidence for an abnormal T
cell response it is usually not to the antigen recognised by autoantibodies.
Thus, in rheumatoid arthritis there are autoantibodies to IgG Fc but apparently
no corresponding T cell response. In systemic lupus there are autoantibodies to
DNA, which cannot evoke a T cell response, and limited evidence for T cell
responses implicates nucleoprotein antigens. In Celiac disease there are
autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase but the T cell response is to the
foreign protein gliadin. This disparity has led to the idea that human
autoimmune disease is in most cases (with probable exceptions including type I
diabetes) based on a loss of B cell tolerance which makes use of normal T cell
responses to foreign antigens in a variety of aberrant ways.[8]
***** Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity[edit] *****
There are a large number of immunodeficiency syndromes that present clinical
and laboratory characteristics of autoimmunity. The decreased ability of the
immune system to clear infections in these patients may be responsible for
causing autoimmunity through perpetual immune system activation.[9]
One example is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) where multiple
autoimmune diseases are seen, e.g.: inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune
thrombocytopenia and autoimmune thyroid disease.
Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, an autosomal recessive primary
immunodeficiency, is another example. Pancytopenia, rashes, swollen_lymph_nodes
and enlargement_of_the_liver_and_spleen are commonly seen in such individuals.
Presence of multiple uncleared viral infections due to lack of perforin are
thought to be responsible.
In addition to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases
including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma and type_1
diabetes_mellitus are also seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Recurrent
bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammation of the gut and lungs
are seen in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) as well. CGD is a caused by
decreased production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
oxidase by neutrophils. Hypomorphic RAG mutations are seen in patients with
midline granulomatous disease; an autoimmune disorder that is commonly seen in
patients with granulomatosis_with_polyangiitis and NK/T cell lymphomas.
Wiskott-Aldrich_syndrome (WAS) patients also present with eczema, autoimmune
manifestations, recurrent bacterial infections and lymphoma.
In autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also
autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations
(e.g. hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) and chronic mucocutaneous
candidiasis.
Finally, IgA_deficiency is also sometimes associated with the development of
autoimmune and atopic phenomena.
***** Genetic factors[edit] *****
Certain individuals are genetically susceptible to developing autoimmune
diseases. This susceptibility is associated with multiple genes plus other risk
factors. Genetically predisposed individuals do not always develop autoimmune
diseases.
Three main sets of genes are suspected in many autoimmune diseases. These genes
are related to:
    * Immunoglobulins
    * T-cell_receptors
    * The major_histocompatibility_complexes (MHC).
The first two, which are involved in the recognition of antigens, are
inherently variable and susceptible to recombination. These variations enable
the immune system to respond to a very wide variety of invaders, but may also
give rise to lymphocytes capable of self-reactivity.

    * HLA DR2 is strongly positively correlated with Systemic_Lupus
      Erythematosus, narcolepsy[10] and multiple_sclerosis, and negatively
      correlated with DM Type 1.
    * HLA DR3 is correlated strongly with SjÃ¶gren's_syndrome, myasthenia
      gravis, SLE, and DM Type 1.
    * HLA DR4 is correlated with the genesis of rheumatoid_arthritis, Type 1
      diabetes_mellitus, and pemphigus_vulgaris.
Fewer correlations exist with MHC class I molecules. The most notable and
consistent is the association between HLA B27 and spondyloarthropathies like
ankylosing_spondylitis and reactive_arthritis. Correlations may exist between
polymorphisms within class II MHC promoters and autoimmune disease.
The contributions of genes outside the MHC complex remain the subject of
research, in animal models of disease (Linda Wicker's extensive genetic studies
of diabetes in the NOD mouse), and in patients (Brian Kotzin's linkage analysis
of susceptibility to SLE).
Recently, PTPN22 has been associated with multiple autoimmune diseases
including Type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
Hashimotoâs thyroiditis, Gravesâ disease, Addisonâs disease, Myasthenia
Gravis, vitiligo, systemic sclerosis juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and
psoriatic arthritis.[11][clarification_needed]
***** Sex[edit] *****
Ratio of female/male incidence
of autoimmune diseases
Hashimoto's_thyroiditis            10:1[12]
Graves'_disease                    7:1[12]
Multiple_sclerosis (MS)            2:1[12]
Myasthenia_gravis                  2:1[12]
Systemic_lupus_erythematosus (SLE) 9:1[12]
Rheumatoid_arthritis               5:2[12]
Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis     1:2
There is some evidence that a person's sex may also have some role in the
development of autoimmunity; that is, most autoimmune diseases are sex-related.
A few autoimmune diseases that men are just as or more likely to develop as
women include: ankylosing_spondylitis, type_1_diabetes_mellitus, granulomatosis
with_polyangiitis, Crohn's_disease, Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis and
psoriasis.
The reasons for the sex role in autoimmunity vary. Women appear to generally
mount larger inflammatory responses than men when their immune systems are
triggered, increasing the risk of autoimmunity. Involvement of sex_steroids is
indicated by that many autoimmune diseases tend to fluctuate in accordance with
hormonal changes, for example: during pregnancy, in the menstrual cycle, or
when using oral contraception. A history of pregnancy also appears to leave a
persistent increased risk for autoimmune disease. It has been suggested that
the slight, direct exchange of cells between mothers and their children during
pregnancy may induce autoimmunity.[13] This would tip the gender balance in the
direction of the female.
Another theory suggests the female high tendency to get autoimmunity is due to
an imbalanced X_chromosome_inactivation.[14] The X-inactivation skew theory,
proposed by Princeton University's Jeff Stewart, has recently been confirmed
experimentally in scleroderma and autoimmune thyroiditis.[15] Other complex X-
linked genetic susceptibility mechanisms are proposed and under investigation.
***** Environmental factors[edit] *****
An interesting inverse relationship exists between infectious diseases and
autoimmune diseases. In areas where multiple infectious diseases are endemic,
autoimmune diseases are quite rarely seen. The reverse, to some extent, seems
to hold true. The hygiene_hypothesis attributes these correlations to the
immune manipulating strategies of pathogens. While such an observation has been
variously termed as spurious and ineffective, according to some studies,
parasite infection is associated with reduced activity of autoimmune disease.
[16][17][18]
The putative mechanism is that the parasite attenuates the host immune response
in order to protect itself. This may provide a serendipitous benefit to a host
that also suffers from autoimmune disease. The details of parasite immune
modulation are not yet known, but may include secretion of anti-inflammatory
agents or interference with the host immune signaling.
A paradoxical observation has been the strong association of certain microbial
organisms with autoimmune diseases. For example, Klebsiella_pneumoniae and
coxsackievirus_B have been strongly correlated with ankylosing_spondylitis and
diabetes_mellitus_type_1, respectively. This has been explained by the tendency
of the infecting organism to produce super-antigens that are capable of
polyclonal activation of B-lymphocytes, and production of large amounts of
antibodies of varying specificities, some of which may be self-reactive (see
below).
Certain chemical agents and drugs can also be associated with the genesis of
autoimmune conditions, or conditions that simulate autoimmune diseases. The
most striking of these is the drug-induced_lupus_erythematosus. Usually,
withdrawal of the offending drug cures the symptoms in a patient.
Cigarette smoking is now established as a major risk factor for both incidence
and severity of rheumatoid_arthritis. This may relate to abnormal
citrullination of proteins, since the effects of smoking correlate with the
presence of antibodies to citrullinated peptides.
***** Pathogenesis of autoimmunity[edit] *****
Several mechanisms are thought to be operative in the pathogenesis of
autoimmune diseases, against a backdrop of genetic predisposition and
environmental modulation. It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss
each of these mechanisms exhaustively, but a summary of some of the important
mechanisms have been described:
    * T-Cell Bypass â A normal immune system requires the activation of B-
      cells by T-cells before the former can undergo differentiation into
      plasma B-cells and subsequently produce antibodies in large quantities.
      This requirement of a T-cell can be bypassed in rare instances, such as
      infection by organisms producing super-antigens, which are capable of
      initiating polyclonal activation of B-cells, or even of T-cells, by
      directly binding to the Î²-subunit of T-cell receptors in a non-specific
      fashion.
    * T-Cell-B-Cell discordance â A normal immune response is assumed to
      involve B and T cell responses to the same antigen, even if we know that
      B cells and T cells recognise very different things: conformations on the
      surface of a molecule for B cells and pre-processed peptide fragments of
      proteins for T cells. However, there is nothing as far as we know that
      requires this. All that is required is that a B cell recognising antigen
      X endocytoses and processes a protein Y (normally =X) and presents it to
      a T cell. Roosnek and Lanzavecchia showed that B cells recognising IgGFc
      could get help from any T cell responding to an antigen co-endocytosed
      with IgG by the B cell as part of an immune complex. In coeliac disease
      it seems likely that B cells recognising tissue transglutamine are helped
      by T cells recognising gliadin.
    * Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated feedback â A feature of human
      autoimmune disease is that it is largely restricted to a small group of
      antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune
      response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin
      receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous
      autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens
      leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through
      membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for
      antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like
      receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More
      indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with
      autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and
      hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-
      cell-B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of
      self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells.[19] Autoreactive B cells in
      spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both
      of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B cell
      receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell
      self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-
      tolerance.
    * Molecular_Mimicry â An exogenous antigen may share structural
      similarities with certain host antigens; thus, any antibody produced
      against this antigen (which mimics the self-antigens) can also, in
      theory, bind to the host antigens, and amplify the immune response. The
      idea of molecular mimicry arose in the context of Rheumatic_Fever, which
      follows infection with Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci. Although
      rheumatic fever has been attributed to molecular mimicry for half a
      century no antigen has been formally identified (if anything too many
      have been proposed). Moreover, the complex tissue distribution of the
      disease (heart, joint, skin, basal ganglia) argues against a cardiac
      specific antigen. It remains entirely possible that the disease is due to
      e.g. an unusual interaction between immune complexes, complement
      components and endothelium.
    * Idiotype Cross-Reaction â Idiotypes are antigenic epitopes found in the
      antigen-binding portion (Fab) of the immunoglobulin molecule. Plotz and
      Oldstone presented evidence that autoimmunity can arise as a result of a
      cross-reaction between the idiotype on an antiviral antibody and a host
      cell receptor for the virus in question. In this case, the host-cell
      receptor is envisioned as an internal image of the virus, and the anti-
      idiotype antibodies can react with the host cells.
    * Cytokine Dysregulation â Cytokines have been recently divided into two
      groups according to the population of cells whose functions they promote:
      Helper T-cells type 1 or type 2. The second category of cytokines, which
      include IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-Î² (to name a few), seem to have a role in
      prevention of exaggeration of pro-inflammatory immune responses.
    * Dendritic cell apoptosis â immune system cells called dendritic_cells
      present antigens to active lymphocytes. Dendritic cells that are
      defective in apoptosis can lead to inappropriate systemic lymphocyte
      activation and consequent decline in self-tolerance.[20]
    * Epitope spreading or epitope drift â when the immune_reaction changes
      from targeting the primary epitope to also targeting other epitopes.[21]
      In contrast to molecular mimicry, the other epitopes need not be
      structurally similar to the primary one.
    * Epitope modification or Cryptic epitope exposure â this mechanism of
      autoimmune disease is unique in that it does not result from a defect in
      the hematopoietic system. Instead, disease results from the exposure of
      cryptic N-glycan (polysaccharide) linkages common to lower eukaryotes and
      prokaryotes on the glycoproteins of mammalian non-hematopoietic cells and
      organs[22] This exposure of phylogenically primitive glycans activates
      one or more mammalian innate immune cell receptors to induce a chronic
      sterile inflammatory state. In the presence of chronic and inflammatory
      cell damage, the adaptive immune system is recruited and selfâtolerance
      is lost with increased autoantibody production. In this form of the
      disease, the absence of lymphocytes can accelerate organ damage, and
      intravenous IgG administration can be therapeutic. Although this route to
      autoimmune disease may underlie various degenerative disease states, no
      diagnostics for this disease mechanism exist at present, and thus its
      role in human autoimmunity is currently unknown.
The roles of specialized immunoregulatory cell types, such as regulatory_T
cells, NKT_cells, Î³Î´_T-cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease are
under investigation.
***** Classification[edit] *****
Autoimmune diseases can be broadly divided into systemic and organ-specific or
localised autoimmune disorders, depending on the principal clinico-pathologic
features of each disease.
    * Systemic_autoimmune_diseases include coeliac_disease, lupus
      erythematosus, SjÃ¶gren's_syndrome, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, rheumatoid
      arthritis, cryoglobulinemic_vasculitis, and dermatomyositis. These
      conditions tend to be associated with autoantibodies to antigens which
      are not tissue specific. Thus although polymyositis is more or less
      tissue specific in presentation, it may be included in this group because
      the autoantigens are often ubiquitous t-RNA synthetases.
    * Local syndromes which affect a specific organ or tissue:
          o Endocrinologic: diabetes_mellitus_type_1, Hashimoto's_thyroiditis,
            Addison's_disease
          o Gastrointestinal: Crohn's_disease, pernicious_anaemia
          o Dermatologic: pemphigus_vulgaris, vitiligo
          o Haematologic: autoimmune_haemolytic_anaemia, idiopathic
            thrombocytopenic_purpura
          o Neurological: multiple_sclerosis, myasthenia_gravis, autoimmune
            encephalitis, gluten_ataxia
Using the traditional âorgan specificâ and ânon-organ specificâ
classification scheme, many diseases have been lumped together under the
autoimmune disease umbrella. However, many chronic inflammatory human disorders
lack the telltale associations of B and T cell driven immunopathology. In the
last decade it has been firmly established that tissue "inflammation against
self" does not necessarily rely on abnormal T and B cell responses.
This has led to the recent proposal that the spectrum of autoimmunity should be
viewed along an âimmunological disease continuum,â with classical
autoimmune diseases at one extreme and diseases driven by the innate immune
system at the other extreme. Within this scheme, the full spectrum of
autoimmunity can be included. Many common human autoimmune diseases can be seen
to have a substantial innate immune mediated immunopathology using this new
scheme. This new classification scheme has implications for understanding
disease mechanisms and for therapy development.[23]
***** Diagnosis[edit] *****
Diagnosis of autoimmune disorders largely rests on accurate history and
physical examination of the patient, and high index of suspicion against a
backdrop of certain abnormalities in routine laboratory tests (example,
elevated C-reactive_protein). In several systemic disorders, serological assays
which can detect specific autoantibodies can be employed. Localised disorders
are best diagnosed by immunofluorescence of biopsy specimens. Autoantibodies
are used to diagnose many autoimmune diseases. The levels of autoantibodies are
measured to determine the progress of the disease.
***** Treatments[edit] *****
Treatments for autoimmune disease have traditionally been immunosuppressive,
anti-inflammatory, or palliative.[7] Managing inflammation is critical in
autoimmune diseases.[24] Non-immunological therapies, such as hormone
replacement in Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Type 1 diabetes mellitus treat
outcomes of the autoaggressive response, thus these are palliative treatments.
Dietary manipulation limits the severity of celiac disease. Steroidal or NSAID
treatment limits inflammatory symptoms of many diseases. IVIG is used for CIDP
and GBS. Specific immunomodulatory therapies, such as the TNFÎ± antagonists
(e.g. etanercept), the B cell depleting agent rituximab, the anti-IL-6 receptor
tocilizumab and the costimulation blocker abatacept have been shown to be
useful in treating RA. Some of these immunotherapies may be associated with
increased risk of adverse effects, such as susceptibility to infection.
Helminthic_therapy is an experimental approach that involves inoculation of the
patient with specific parasitic intestinal nematodes (helminths). There are
currently two closely related treatments available, inoculation with either
Necator americanus, commonly known as hookworms, or Trichuris Suis Ova,
commonly known as Pig Whipworm Eggs.[25][25][26][27][28][29]
T_cell_vaccination is also being explored as a possible future therapy for
autoimmune disorders.
**** Nutrition and autoimmunity[edit] ****
Vitamin D/Sunlight
          * Because most human cells and tissues have receptors for vitamin D,
            including T and B cells, adequate levels of vitamin D can aid in
            the regulation of the immune system.[30] Vitamin D plays a role in
            immune function by acting on T_cells and natural_killer cells.[31] 
            Research has demonstrated an association between low serum vitamin
            D and autoimmune diseases, including multiple_sclerosis, type_1
            diabetes, and Systemic_Lupus_Erythematosus (commonly referred to
            simply as lupus).[31][32][33]  However,
            since photosensitivity occurs in lupus, patients are advised to
            avoid sunlight which may be responsible for vitamin D deficiency
            seen in this disease.[31][32][33] Polymorphisms in the vitamin_D
            receptor gene are commonly found in people with autoimmune
            diseases, giving one potential mechanism for vitamin D's role in
            autoimmunity.[31][32] There is mixed evidence on the effect of
            vitamin D supplementation in type 1 diabetes, lupus, and multiple
            sclerosis.[31][32][33] 
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
          * Studies have shown that adequate consumption of omega-3 fatty acids
            counteracts the effects of arachidonic acids, which contribute to
            symptoms of autoimmune diseases. Human and animal trials suggest
            that omega-3 is an effective treatment_modality for many cases of
            Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Asthma, and
            Psoriasis.[34]
          * While major depression is not necessarily an autoimmune disease,
            some of its physiological symptoms are inflammatory and autoimmune
            in nature. Omega-3 may inhibit production of interferon gamma and
            other cytokines which cause the physiological symptoms of
            depression. This may be due to the fact that an imbalance in omega-
            3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which have opposing effects, is
            instrumental in the etiology of major depression.[34]
Probiotics/Microflora
          * Various types of bacteria and microflora present in fermented dairy
            products, especially Lactobacillus casei, have been shown to both
            stimulate immune response to tumors in mice and to regulate immune
            function, delaying or preventing the onset of nonobese diabetes.
            This is particularly true of the Shirota strain of L. casei (LcS).
            The LcS strain is mainly found in yogurt and similar products in
            Europe and Japan, and rarely elsewhere.[35]
Antioxidants
          * It has been theorized that free radicals contribute to the onset of
            type-1 diabetes in infants and young children, and therefore that
            the risk could be reduced by high intake of antioxidant substances
            during pregnancy. However, a study conducted in a hospital in
            Finland from 1997-2002 concluded that there was no statistically
            significant correlation between antioxidant intake and diabetes
            risk.[36] This study involved monitoring of food intake through
            questionnaires, and estimated antioxidant intake on this basis,
            rather than by exact measurements or use of supplements.
