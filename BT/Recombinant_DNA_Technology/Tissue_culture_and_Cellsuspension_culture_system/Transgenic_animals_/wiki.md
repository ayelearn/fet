Main article: Genetic_engineering_techniques
The process of genetically engineering mammals is a slow, tedious, and
expensive process.[2] As with other genetically modified organisms (GMOs),
first genetic engineers must isolated the gene they wish to insert into the
host organism. This can be taken from a cell containing the gene[3] or
artificially_synthesised.[4] If the chosen gene or the donor organism's genome
has been well studied it may already be accessible from a genetic_library. The
gene is then combined with other genetic elements, including a promoter and
terminator region and usually a selectable_marker.[5]
A number of techniques are available for inserting_the_isolated_gene_into_the
host_genome. With animals DNA is generally inserted into using microinjection,
where it can be injected through the cell's nuclear_envelope directly into the
nucleus, or through the use of viral_vectors.[6] The first transgenic animals
were produced by injecting viral DNA into embryos and then implanting the
embryos in females.[7] It is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is
present in the embryonic_stem_cells.[8] The embryo would develop and it would
be hoped that some of the genetic material would be incorporated into the
reproductive cells. Then researchers would have to wait until the animal
reached breeding age and then offspring would be screened for presence of the
gene in every cell, using PCR, Southern_hybridization, and DNA_sequencing.[9]
New technologies are making genetic modifications easier and more precise.[2]
Gene_targeting techniques, which creates double-stranded_breaks and takes
advantage on the cells natural homologous_recombination repair systems, have
been developed to target insertion to exact locations. Genome_editing uses
artificially engineered nucleases that create breaks at specific points. There
are four families of engineered nucleases: meganucleases,[10][11] zinc_finger
nucleases,[12][13] transcription_activator-like_effector_nucleases (TALENs),
[14][15] and the Cas9-guideRNA system (adapted from CRISPR).[16][17] TALEN and
CRISPR are the two most commonly used and each has its own advantages.[18]
TALENs have greater target specificity, while CRISPR is easier to design and
more efficient.[18] The development of the CRISPR-Cas9_gene_editing system has
effectively halved the amount of time needed to develop genetically modified
animals.[19]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_genetic_engineering
In 1974 Rudolf_Jaenisch created the first GM animal.
Humans have domesticated animals since around 12,000 BCE, using selective
breeding or artificial selection (as contrasted with natural_selection). The
process of selective_breeding, in which organisms with desired traits (and thus
with the desired genes) are used to breed the next generation and organisms
lacking the trait are not bred, is a precursor to the modern concept of genetic
modification[20]:1 Various advancements in genetics allowed humans to directly
alter the DNA and therefore genes of organisms. In 1972 Paul_Berg created the
first recombinant_DNA molecule when he combined DNA from a monkey_virus with
that of the lambda_virus.[21][22]
In 1974 Rudolf_Jaenisch created a transgenic_mouse by introducing foreign DNA
into its embryo, making it the worldâs first transgenic animal.[23][24]
However it took another eight years before transgenic mice were developed that
passed the transgene to their offspring.[25][26] Genetically modified mice were
created in 1984 that carried cloned oncogenes, predisposing them to developing
cancer.[27] Mice with genes knocked_out (knockout_mouse) were created in 1989.
The first transgenic livestock were produced in 1985[28] and the first animal
to synthesise transgenic proteins in their milk were mice,[29] engineered to
produce human tissue plasminogen activator in 1987.[30]
The first genetically modified animal to be commercialised was the GloFish, a
Zebra_fish with a fluorescent_gene added that allows it to glow in the dark
under ultraviolet_light.[31] It was released to the US market in 2003.[32] The
first genetically modified animal to be approved for food use was AquAdvantage
salmon in 2015.[33] The salmon were transformed with a growth_hormone-
regulating gene from a Pacific_Chinook_salmon and a promoter from an ocean_pout
enabling it to grow year-round instead of only during spring and summer.[34]
***** Mammals[edit] *****
Main article: Genetically_modified_mammals
Some chimeras, like the blotched mouse shown, are created through genetic
modification techniques like gene_targeting.
GM mammals are created for research purposes, production of industrial or
therapeutic products, agricultural uses or improving their health. There is
also a market for creating genetically modified pets.[35]
**** Medicine[edit] ****
Mammals are the best models for human disease, making genetic engineered ones
vital to the discovery and development of cures and treatments for many serious
diseases. Knocking out genes responsible for human_genetic_disorders allows
researchers to study the mechanism of the disease and to test possible cures.
Genetically_modified_mice have been the most common mammals used in biomedical
research, as they are cheap and easy to manipulate. Pigs are also a good target
as they have a similar body size and anatomical features, physiology,
pathophysiological response and diet.[36] Nonhuman primates are the most
similar model organisms to humans, but there is less public acceptance towards
using them as research animals.[37] In 2009, scientists announced that they had
successfully transferred a gene into a primate species (marmosets) and produced
a stable line of breeding transgenic primates for the first time.[38][39] Their
first research target for these marmosets was Parkinson's_disease, but they
were also considering amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis and Huntington's_disease.
[40]
Transgenic pig for cheese production
Human proteins expressed in mammals are more likely to be similar to their
natural counterparts than those expressed in plants or microorganisms. Stable
expression has been accomplished in sheep, pigs, rats and other animals. In
2009, the first human biological drug produced from such an animal, a goat.,
was approved. The drug, ATryn, is an anticoagulant which reduces the
probability of blood_clots during surgery or childbirth was extracted from the
goat's milk.[41] Human alpha-1-antitrypsin is another protein that is used in
treating humans with this deficiency.[42] Another area is in creating pigs with
greater capacity for human_organ_transplants (xenotransplantation). Pigs have
been genetically modified so that their organs can no longer carry retroviruses
[43] or have modifications to reduce the chance of rejection.[44][45] Pig lungs
from genetically modified pigs are being considered for transplantation into
humans.[46][47] There is even potential to create chimeric pigs that can carry
human organs.[36][48]
**** Livestock[edit] ****
Livestock are modified with the intention of improving economically important
traits such as growth-rate, quality of meat, milk composition, disease
resistance and survival. Animals have been engineered to grow faster, be
healthier[49] and resist diseases.[50] Modifications have also improved the
wool production of sheep and udder health of cows.[1]
Goats have been genetically engineered to produce milk with strong spiderweb-
like silk proteins in their milk.[51] The goat gene sequence has been modified,
using fresh umbilical cords taken from kids, in order to code for the human
enzyme lysozyme. Researchers wanted to alter the milk produced by the goats, to
contain lysozyme in order to fight off bacteria causing diarrhea in humans.[52]
Enviropig was a genetically enhanced line of Yorkshire_pigs in Canada created
with the capability of digesting plant phosphorus more efficiently than
conventional Yorkshire pigs.[53][54] The A transgene construct consisting of a
promoter expressed in the murine parotid_gland and the Escherichia_coli phytase
gene was introduced into the pig embryo by pronuclear microinjection.[55] This
caused the pigs to produce the enzyme phytase, which breaks down the
indigestible phosphorus, in their saliva.[53][56] As a result they excrete 30
to 70% less phosphorus in manure depending upon the age and diet.[53][56] The
lower concentrations of phosphorus in surface_runoff reduces algal growth,
because phosphorus is the limiting_nutrient for algae.[53] Because algae
consume large amounts of oxygen, excessive growth can result in dead zones for
fish. Funding for the Enviropig program ended in April 2012,[57] and as no new
partners were found the pigs were killed.[58] However, the genetic material
will be stored at the Canadian Agricultural Genetics Repository Program. In
2006, a pig was engineered to produce omega-3_fatty_acids through the
expression of a roundworm gene.[59]
Herman the Bull on display in Naturalis_Biodiversity_Center
In 1990, the world's first transgenic bovine, Herman the Bull, was developed.
Herman was genetically engineered by micro-injected embyonic cells with the
human gene coding for lactoferrin. The Dutch_Parliament changed the law in 1992
to allow Herman to reproduce. Eight calves were born in 1994 and all calves
inherited the lactoferrin gene.[60] With subsequent sirings, Herman fathered a
total of 83 calves.[61] Dutch law required Herman to be slaughtered at the
conclusion of the experiment. However the Dutch Agriculture Minister at the
time, Jozias_van_Aartsen, granted him a reprieve provided he did not have more
offspring after public and scientists rallied to his defence.[62] Together with
cloned cows named Holly and Belle, he lived out his retirement at Naturalis,
the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden.[62] On 2 April 2004, Herman
was euthanised by veterinarians from the University_of_Utrecht because he
suffered from osteoarthritis.[63][62] At the time of his death Herman was one
of the oldest bulls in the Netherlands.[63] Herman's hide has been preserved
and mounted by taxidermists and is permanently on display in Naturalis. They
say that he represents the start of a new era in the way man deals with nature,
an icon of scientific progress, and the subsequent public discussion of these
issues.[63]
Researchers have developed GM dairy cattle to grow without horns (sometimes
referred to as "polled") which can cause injuries to farmers and other animals.
DNA was taken from the genome of Red_Angus cattle, which is known to suppress
horn growth, and inserted into cells taken from an elite Holstein bull called
"Randy". Each of the progeny will be a clone of Randy, but without his horns,
and their offspring should also be hornless.[64] In 2011, Chinese scientists
generated dairy_cows genetically engineered with genes from human beings to
produce milk that would be the same as human breast milk.[65] This could
potentially benefit mothers who cannot produce breast milk but want their
children to have breast milk rather than formula.[66][67] The researchers claim
these transgenic cows to be identical to regular cows.[68] Two months later,
scientists from Argentina presented Rosita, a transgenic cow incorporating two
human genes, to produce milk with similar properties as human breast milk.[69]
In 2012, researchers from New Zealand also developed a genetically engineered
cow that produced allergy-free milk.[70]
**** Research[edit] ****
Scientists have genetically engineered several organisms, including some
mammals, to include green_fluorescent_protein (GFP), for research purposes.[71]
GFP and other similar reporting genes allow easy visualisation and localisation
of the products of the genetic modification.[72] Fluorescent pigs have been
bred to study human organ transplants, regenerating ocular photoreceptor_cells,
and other topics.[73] In 2011 green-fluorescent cats were created to find
therapies for HIV/AIDS and other diseases[74] as feline_immunodeficiency_virus
(FIV) is related to HIV.[75]
**** Conservation[edit] ****
Genetically modification with a myxoma_virus has been proposed to conserve
European_wild_rabbits in the Iberian_peninsula and to help regulate them in
Australia. To protect the Iberian species from viral diseases, the myxoma virus
was genetically modified to immunize the rabbits, while in Australia the same
myxoma virus was genetically modified to lower fertility in the Australian
rabbit population.[76] There have also been suggestions that genetic
engineering could be used to bring animals back_from_extinction. It involves
changing the genome of a close living relative to resemble the extinct one and
is currently being attempted with the passenger_pigeon.[77] Genes associated
with the woolly_mammoth have been added to the genome of an African_Elephant,
although the lead researcher says he has no intention of using live elephants.
[78]
**** Humans[edit] ****
Gene_therapy,[79] uses genetically modified viruses to deliver genes which can
cure disease in humans. Although gene therapy is still relatively new, it has
had some successes. It has been used to treat genetic_disorders such as severe
combined_immunodeficiency,[80] and Leber's_congenital_amaurosis.[81] Treatments
are also being developed for a range of other currently incurable diseases,
such as cystic_fibrosis,[82] sickle_cell_anemia,[83] Parkinson's_disease,[84]
[85] cancer,[86][87][88] diabetes,[89] heart_disease[90] and muscular
dystrophy.[91] These treatments only affect somatic_cells, meaning any changes
would not be inheritable. Germline gene therapy results in any change being
inheritable, which has raised concerns within the scientific community.[92][93]
In 2015, CRISPR was used to edit the DNA of non-viable human_embryos.[94][95]
In November 2018, He_Jiankui announced that he had edited_the_genomes of two
human embryos, to attempt to disable the CCR5 gene, which codes for a receptor
that HIV uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, Lulu_and_Nana, had been
born a few weeks earlier and that they carried functional copies of CCR5 along
with disabled CCR5 (mosaicism) and were still vulnerable to HIV. The work was
widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.[96]
***** Fish[edit] *****
Main article: Genetically_modified_fish
Genetically modified fish are used for scientific research, as pets and as a
food source. Aquaculture is a growing industry, currently providing over half
the consumed fish worldwide.[97] Through genetic engineering It is possible to
increase growth rates, reduce food intake, remove allergenic properties,
increase cold tolerance and provide disease resistance.
**** Detecting pollution[edit] ****
Fish can also be used to detect aquatic pollution or function as bioreactors.
[98] Several groups have been developing zebrafish to detect pollution by
attaching fluorescent proteins to genes activated by the presence of
pollutants. The fish will then glow and can be used as environmental sensors.
[99][100]
**** Pets[edit] ****
The GloFish is a brand of genetically modified fluorescent zebrafish with
bright red, green, and orange fluorescent color. It was originally developed by
one of the groups to detect pollution, but is now part of the ornamental fish
trade, becoming the first genetically modified animal to become publicly
available as a pet when it was introduced for sale in 2003.[101]
**** Research[edit] ****
GM fish are widely used in basic research in genetics and development. Two
species of fish, zebrafish and medaka, are most commonly modified because they
have optically clear chorions (membranes in the egg), rapidly develop, and the
1-cell embryo is easy to see and microinject with transgenic DNA.[102]
Zebrafish are model organisms for developmental processes, regeneration,
genetics, behaviour, disease mechanisms and toxicity testing.[103] Their
transparency allows researchers to observe developmental stages, intestinal
functions and tumour growth.[104][105] The generation of transgenic protocols
(whole organism, cell or tissue specific, tagged with reporter genes) has
increased the level of information gained by studying these fish.[106]
**** Growth[edit] ****
GM fish have been developed with promoters driving an over-production of "all
fish" growth_hormone for use in the aquaculture industry to increase the speed
of development and potentially reduce fishing pressure on wild stocks. This has
resulted in dramatic growth enhancement in several species, including salmon,
[107] trout[108] and tilapia.[109]
AquaBounty_Technologies have produced a salmon that can mature in half the time
as wild salmon.[110] The fish is an Atlantic salmon with a Chinook_salmon
(Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) gene inserted. This allows the fish to produce
growth hormones all year round compared to the wild-type fish that produces the
hormone for only part of the year.[111] The fish also has a second gene
inserted from the eel-like ocean_pout that acts like an "on" switch for the
hormone.[111] Pout also have antifreeze_proteins in their blood, which allow
the GM salmon to survive near-freezing waters and continue their development.
[112] The wild-type salmon takes 24 to 30 months to reach market size
(4â6 kg) whereas the producers of the GM salmon say it requires only 18
months for the GM fish to achieve this.[112][113][114] In November 2015, the
FDA of the USA approved the AquAdvantage_salmon for commercial production, sale
and consumption,[115] the first non-plant GMO food to be commerialised.[116]
AquaBounty say that to prevent the genetically modified fish inadvertently
breeding with wild salmon, all the fish will be female and reproductively
sterile,[114] although a small percentage of the females may remain fertile.
[111] Some opponents of the GM salmon have dubbed it the "Frankenfish".[111]
[117]
***** Insects[edit] *****
See also: Genetically_modified_insect
**** Research[edit] ****
In biological research, transgenic fruit flies (Drosophila_melanogaster) are
model_organisms used to study the effects of genetic changes on development.
[118] Fruit flies are often preferred over other animals due to their short
life cycle and low maintenance requirements. It also has a relatively simple
genome compared to many vertebrates, with typically only one copy of each gene,
making phenotypic analysis easy.[119] Drosophila have been used to study
genetics and inheritance, embryonic development, learning, behavior, and aging.
[120] Transposons (particularly P elements) are well developed in Drosophila
and provided an early method to add transgenes to their genome, although this
has been taken over by more modern gene-editing techniques.[121]
**** Population control[edit] ****
Due to their significance to human health, scientists are looking at ways to
control mosquitoes through genetic engineering. Malaria-resistant mosquitoes
have been developed in the laboratory.[122] by inserting a gene that reduces
the development of the malaria parasite[123] and then use homing_endonucleases
to rapidly spread that gene throughout the male population (known as a gene
drive).[124] This has been taken further by swapping it for a lethal gene.[125]
[126] In trials the populations of Aedes_aegypti mosquitoes, the single most
important carrier of dengue fever and Zika virus, were reduced by between 80%
and by 90%.[127][128][126] Another approach is to use the sterile_insect
technique, whereby males genetically engineered to be sterile out compete
viable males, to reduce population numbers.[129]
Other insect pests that make attractive targets are moths. Diamondback_moths
cause US$4 to $5 billion of damage a year worldwide.[130] The approach is
similar to the mosquitoes, where males transformed with a gene that prevents
females from reaching maturity will be released.[131] They underwent field
trials in 2017.[130] Genetically modified moths have previously been released
in field trials.[132] A strain of pink_bollworm that were sterilised with
radiation were genetically engineered to express a red_fluorescent_protein
making it easier for researchers to monitor them.[133]
**** Industry[edit] ****
Silkworm, the larvae stage of Bombyx_mori, is an economically important insect
in sericulture. Scientists are developing strategies to enhance silk quality
and quantity. There is also potential to use the silk producing machinery to
make other valuable proteins.[134] Proteins expressed by silkworms include;
human_serum_albumin, human_collagen_Î±-chain, mouse monoclonal_antibody and N-
glycanase.[135] Silkworms have been created that produce spider_silk, a
stronger but extremely difficult to harvest silk,[136] and even novel silks.
[137]
***** Birds[edit] *****
Attempts to produce genetically modified birds began before 1980.[138] Chickens
have been genetically modified for a variety of purposes. This includes
studying embryo_development,[139] preventing the transmission of bird_flu[140]
and providing evolutionary insights using reverse_engineering to recreate
dinosaur-like phenotypes.[141] A GM chicken that produces the drug Kanuma, an
enzyme that treats a rare condition, in its egg passed regulatory approval in
2015.[142]
**** Disease control[edit] ****
One potential use of GM birds could be to reduce the spread of avian disease.
Researchers at Roslin_Institute have produced a strain of GM chickens (Gallus
gallus domesticus) that does not transmit avian_flu to other birds; however,
these birds are still susceptible to contracting it. The genetic modification
is an RNA molecule that prevents the virus reproduction by mimicking the region
of the flu virus genome that controls replication. It is referred to as a
"decoy" because it diverts the flu virus enzyme, the polymerase, from functions
that are required for virus replication.[143]
**** Evolutionary insights[edit] ****
A team of geneticists led by University_of_Montana paleontologist Jack_Horner
is seeking to modify a chicken to express several features present in ancestral
maniraptorans but absent in modern birds, such as teeth and a long tail,[144]
creating what has been dubbed a 'chickenosaurus'.[145] Parallel projects have
produced chicken embryos expressing dinosaur-like skull,[146] leg,[141] and
foot[147] anatomy.
***** Amphibians[edit] *****
Genetically modified frogs, in particular Xenopus_laevis and Xenopus
tropicalis, are used in development_biology. GM frogs can also being used as
pollution sensors, especially for endocrine_disrupting_chemicals.[148] There
are proposals to use genetic engineering to control cane_toads_in_Australia.
[149][150]
***** Nematodes[edit] *****
The nemotode Caenorhabditis_elegans is one of the major model organisms for
researching molecular_biology.[151] RNA_interference (RNAi) was discovered in C
elegans[152] and could be induced by simply feeding them bacteria modified to
express double_stranded_RNA.[153] It is also relatively easy to produce stable
transgenic nemotodes and this along with RNAi are the major tools used in
studying their genes.[154] The most common use of transgenic nematodes has been
studying gene expression and localisation by attaching reporter genes.
Transgenes can also be combined with RNAi to rescue phenotypes, altered to
study gene function, imaged in real time as the cells develop or used to
control expression for different tissues or developmental stages.[154]
Transgenic nematodes have been used to study viruses,[155] toxicology,[156] and
diseases[157][158] and to detect environmental pollutants.[159]
***** Other[edit] *****
Systems have been developed to create transgenic organisms in a wide variety of
other animals. The gene responsible for Albinism in sea_cucumbers has been
found and used to engineer white_sea_cucumbers, a rare delicacy. The technology
also opens the way to investigate the genes responsible for some of the
cucumbers more unusual traits, including hibernating in summer, eviscerating
their intestines, and dissolving their bodies upon death.[160] Flatworms have
the ability to regenerate themselves from a single cell.[161] Until 2017 there
was no effective way to transform them, which hampered research. By using
microinjection and radiation scientist have now created the first genetically
modified flatworms.[162] The bristle_worm, a marine annelid, has been modified.
It is of interest due to its reproductive cycle being synchronised with lunar
phases, regeneration capacity and slow evolution rate.[163] Cnidaria such as
Hydra and the sea anemone Nematostella_vectensis are attractive model organisms
to study the evolution of immunity and certain developmental processes.[164]
Other organisms that have been genetically modified include snails,[165]
geckos, turtles,[166] crayfish, oysters, shrimp, clams, abalone[167] and
sponges.[168]
