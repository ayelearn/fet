***** Camel[edit] *****
Injaz, a cloned female dromedary camel, was born in 2009 at the Camel
Reproduction Center in Dubai, United_Arab_Emirates[1] after an "uncomplicated"
gestation of 378 days.[2]
***** Carp[edit] *****
Embryologist Tong_Dizhou unsuccessfully inserted the DNA from a male Asian_carp
into the egg of a female Asian carp to create the first fish clone in 1963. In
1973 Dizhou inserted Asian carp DNA into a European_crucian_carp to create the
first interspecies of this clone.[3]
***** Cat[edit] *****
    * In 2001, scientists at Texas_A&M_University created the first cloned cat,
      CC (CopyCat).[4] Even though CC is an exact copy of her host, they have
      different personalities; i.e. CC is shy and timid, her host on the other
      hand is playful and curious.[5]
    * In 2004, the first commercially cloned cat, Little_Nicky, was created by
      Genetic_Savings_&_Clone.[6]
***** Cattle[edit] *****
    * Gene, the first cloned calf in the world was born in 1997 at the American
      Breeders Service facilities in Deforest, Wisconsin, United States. Later
      it was transferred and kept at the Minnesota Zoo Education Center.[7]
      Three more cloned calves were born in 1998.[8]
    * A Holstein heifer named Daisy was cloned by Dr. Xiangzhong (Jerry) Yang
      using ear skin cells from a high-merit cow named Aspen at the University
      of Connecticut in 1999, followed by three additional clones, Amy, Betty,
      and Cathy in 1999.[9]
    * Second Chance, a Brahman_bull was cloned from Chance, a beloved celebrity
      bull. Second Chance was born in August, 1999 at Texas A&M University.[10]
    * Texas A&M University cloned a Black_Angus bull named 86 Squared in 2000,
      after cells from his donor, Bull 86, had been frozen for 15 years. Both
      bulls exhibit a natural resistance to brucellosis, tuberculosis and other
      diseases which can be transferred in meat.[11][12]
    * In 2001 researchers at Advanced_Cell_Technology in Worcester,
      Massachusetts, United States, reported that 24 successfully cloned
      Holsteins had been monitored from birth to the age of four. All
      maintained healthy stats comparable to control cattle, and reached
      reproductive maturity at the proper stage.[13][14] Two of these cloned
      cattle successfully mated, each producing a healthy calf.[14]
    * A purebred Hereford calf clone named Chloe was born in 2001 at Kansas
      State University's purebred research unit. This was Kansas State's first
      cloned calf.[15]
    * Millie and Emma were two female Jersey_cows cloned at the University_of
      Tennessee in 2001. They were the first calves to be produced using
      standard cell-culturing techniques.
    * In 2001, Brazil cloned their first heifer, VitÃ³ria.[16]
    * Pampa, a Jersey calf, was the first animal cloned in Argentina (by the
      company Bio Sidus) in 2002.[17]
    * A Javan_banteng calf was successfully cloned from frozen cells using a
      cow as a surrogate, delivered via c-section April 1, 2003 then hand
      raised at the San Diego Wild Animal Parks Infant Isolation Unit.[18] It
      died due to an injury when it was less than seven years old, about half
      the normal life of a banteng which is an endangered species.[19]
    * The world's first water_buffalo was cloned in Guangxi, China by the
      Guangxi_University in 2005 according to one reference.[20]
    * An Anatolian Grey bull (Efe) was cloned in Turkey in 2009 and four female
      calves from the same breed (Ece, Ecem, Nilufer, Kiraz) in 2010 by the
      Scientific_and_Technological_Research_Council_of_Turkey (TÃBÄ°TAK).[21]
    * Samrupa, the world's first Murrah_buffalo (a type of water buffalo) calf
      cloned using a simple "Hand guided cloning technique" was born in 2009 at
      National_Dairy_Research_Institute (NDRI), Karnal, India, but died due to
      a lung infection five days after she was born.[22] Garima-I, a buffalo
      calf cloned using an "Advanced Hand guided Cloning Technique" was born in
      2009 at the NDRI. Two years later in 2011, she died of a heart failure.
      [23][24] Garima-II, another cloned calf was born in 2010. This buffalo
      was inseminated with frozen-thawed semen of a progeny tested bull and
      gave birth to a female calf, Mahima in 2013.[25] A cloned male buffalo
      calf Shresth was born in 2010 at the NDRI.[26]
    * In May 2010, Got became the first cloned Spanish_Fighting_Bull, cloned by
      Spanish scientists.[27]
    * In February 2011, Brazil cloned a brahman.[28]
    * A Boran_cattle bull was cloned at the International Livestock Research
      Institute in Nairobi.[29]
    * In 2015 the Chinese company BoyaLife announced that in partnership with
      the Korean company Sooam Biotech, they were planning to build a factory
      in_Tianjin,_China to produce 100,000 cloned cattle per year, starting in
      2016 to supply China's growing market for quality beef.[30]
    * In January 2016 the scientist at the Central_Institute_for_Research_on
      Buffaloes in Hisar,_India announced that they had cloned a buffalo
      offspring "Cirb Gaurav" using cells of the ventral side of the tail of
      superior buffalo.[31]
    * In July 2016 scientists at the National_University_Toribio_RodrÃ­guez_de
      Mendoza in Chachapoyas,_Peru cloned a Jersey_cattle by handmade_cloning
      method using cells of an ear of a cow. The first Peruvian clon was called
      "Alma CL-01".[32]
***** Coyote[edit] *****
Sooam Biotech, Korea cloned eight coyotes in 2011 using domestic dogs as
surrogate mothers.[33]
***** Deer[edit] *****
    * Dewey was born in 2003 at Texas A&M University.[34]

    * Snuppy, an Afghan hound puppy, was the first dog to be cloned, in 2005 in
      South Korea.[35]
    * Sooam Biotech, South Korea, was reported in 2015 to have cloned 700 dogs
      to date for their owners. They were also reported to charge $100,000 for
      each cloned puppy.[36] One puppy was cloned from the cells of a dog that
      had died 12 days before.[36]
    * Sinogene, a Beijing, China-based biotechnology company, was reported in
      December 2017 to have cloned Apple, a gene-edited dog, with the clone
      being named "Longlong".[37][38]
***** Frog (tadpole)[edit] *****
In 1958, John_Gurdon, then at Oxford_University, explained that he had
successfully cloned a frog named Damian. He did this by using intact nuclei
from somatic cells from a Xenopus tadpole.[39] This was an important extension
of work of Briggs and King in 1952 on transplanting nuclei from embryonic
blastula cells.[40]

      born at the Royan_Institute in Isfahan, Iran in 2009. The cloned goat was
      developed in the surrogate uterus of a Bakhtiari goat. Iranian
      researchers were reported in 2009 to be planning to use cloned goats to
      eventually manufacture new medications such as antibodies and medicines
      for stroke victims.[45]
    * The world's first pashmina_goat clone was produced at Centre of Animal
      Biotechnology at Sher-e-Kashmir_University_of_Agricultural_Sciences_and
      Technology_of_Kashmir (SKUAST), Indian Administered Kashmir. It was named
      Noori, an Arabic word referring to light. Funded by World_Bank, this
      clone was a joint project of SKUAST and the Karnal-based National_Dairy
      Research_Institute.[46]
***** Horse[edit] *****
    * In 2003, the world's first cloned horse, Prometea, was born.[47]
    * In 2006, Scamper, an extremely successful barrel_racing horse, a gelding,

      breeding line from Gem Twist.
    * In 2010, the first lived equine cloned of a Criollo_horse was born in
      Argentina, and was the first horse clone produced in Latin America.[50]
      In the same year a cloned polo horse was sold for $800,000 - the highest
      known price ever paid for a polo horse.[51]
    * In 2013, the world-famous[52] polo star Adolfo_Cambiaso helped his high-
      handicap team La Dolfina win the Argentine National Open, scoring nine
      goals in the 16-11 match. Two of those he scored atop a horse named Show
      Meâa clone, and the first to ride onto the Argentine pitch.[53][54]
***** House mouse[edit] *****
    * In 1986, the first mouse was cloned in the Soviet_Union from an embryo
      cell.[55]
    * The first mouse from adult cells, Cumulina, was born in 1997 at the
      University_of_Hawai'i_at_MÄnoa in the laboratory of Ryuzo_Yanagimachi
      using the Honolulu_technique.

    * In January 2019, scientists in China reported the creation of five
      identical cloned gene-edited monkeys, using the same cloning technique
      that was used with Zhong_Zhong_and_Hua_Hua â the first ever cloned
      monkeys - and Dolly_the_sheep, and the same gene-editing Crispr-Cas9
