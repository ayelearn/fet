This article is about Chromosomes derived from yeast DNA. For Yeast created
from synthetic DNA, see Synthetic_DNA.
Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) are genetically engineered chromosomes
derived from the DNA of the yeast, Saccharomyces_cerevisiae, which is then
ligated into a bacterial plasmid. By inserting large fragments of DNA, from
100â1000 kb, the inserted sequences can be cloned and physically mapped using
a process called chromosome walking. This is the process that was initially
used for the Human_Genome_Project, however due to stability issues, YACs were
abandoned for the use of Bacterial_artificial_chromosomes_(BAC). Beginning with
the initial research of the Rankin et al., Strul et al., and Hsaio et al., the
inherently fragile chromosome was stabilized by discovering the necessary
autonomously_replicating_sequence (ARS);[1] a refined YAC utilizing this data
was described in 1983 by Murray et al.[2] The primary components of a YAC are
the ARS, centromere, and telomeres from S. cerevisiae. Additionally, selectable
marker genes, such as antibiotic resistance and a visible marker, are utilized
to select transformed yeast cells. Without these sequences, the chromosome will
not be stable during extracellular replication, and would not be
distinguishable from colonies without the vector.[3]

Library. Each of the stacks is approximately 12 microtiter plates. Each plate
has 96 wells, each with different yeast clones.

***** Construction[edit] *****
A YAC is built using an initial circular DNA plasmid, which is typically cut
into a linear DNA molecule using restriction_enzymes; DNA_ligase is then used
to ligate a DNA sequence or gene of interest into the linearized DNA, forming a
single large, circular piece of DNA.[2] The basic generation of linear yeast
artificial chromosomes can be broken down into 6 main steps:
1. Ligation of selectable marker into plasmid vector: this allows for the
differential selection of colonies with, or without the marker gene An
antibiotic_resistance gene allows the YAC vector to be amplified and selected
for in E._coli by rescuing the ability of mutant E. coli to synthesize leucine
in the presence of the necessary components within the growth medium. TRP1 and
URA3 genes are other selectable markers. The YAC vector cloning site for
foreign DNA is located within the SUP4 gene. This gene compensates for a
mutation in the yeast host cell that causes the accumulation of red pigment.
The host cells are normally red, and those transformed with YAC only, will form
colorless colonies. Cloning of a foreign DNA fragment into the YAC causes
insertional inactivation of the gene, restoring the red color. Therefore, the
colonies that contain the foreign DNA fragment are red.[4]
2. Ligation of necessary centromeric sequences for mitotic stability [5]
3. Ligation of Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) providing an origin of
replication to undergo mitotic replication. This allows the plasmid to
replicate extrachromosomally, but renders the plasmid highly mitotically
unstable, and easily lost without the centromeric sequences.[3][6]
4. Ligation of artificial telomeric sequences to convert circular plasmid into
a linear piece of DNA [7]
5. Insertion of DNA sequence to be amplified (up to 1000kb)
6. Transformation yeast colony[8]
***** Full chromosome III[edit] *****
In March 2014, Jef_Boeke of the Langone Medical Centre at New York University,
published that his team has synthesized one of the S._cerevisiae 16 yeast
chromosomes, the chromosome III, that he named synIII.[9][10] The procedure
involved replacing the genes in the original chromosome with synthetic versions
and the finished synthesized chromosome was then integrated into a yeast cell.
It required designing and creating 273,871 base pairs of DNA - fewer than the
316,667 pairs in the original chromosome.
***** Uses in biotechnology[edit] *****
Yeast expression vectors, such as YACs, YIps (yeast integrating plasmids), and
YEps (yeast episomal plasmids), have an advantage over bacterial_artificial
chromosomes (BACs) in that they can be used to express eukaryotic proteins that
require posttranslational_modification. By being able to insert large fragments
of DNA, YACs can be utilized to clone and assemble the entire genomes of an
organism.[11] With the insertion of a YAC into yeast cells, they can be
propagated as linear artificial chromosomes, cloning the inserted regions of
DNA in the process. With this completed, two process can be used to obtain a
sequenced genome, or region of interest:
1. Physical_Mapping
2. Chromosome_Walking[12]
This is significant in that it allows for the detailed mapping of specific
regions of the genome. Whole human chromosomes have been examined, such as the
X chromosome,[13] generating the location of genetic markers for numerous
genetic disorders and traits.[14]
Schematic of the pBR322 plasmid generated in the Boyer Lab at UC San Francisco
by Bolivar and Rodriguez in 1972. It is one of the first and most widely
utilized vectors, and the foundation for the YACs created by Murray and Szostak
in 1983 The plasmid contains ampicillin and tetracycline resistance genes, and
a suite of restriction enzyme target sites for inserting DNA fragments.
***** The Human Genome Project[edit] *****
YACs are significantly less stable than BACs, producing "chimeric effects":
artifacts where the sequence of the cloned DNA actually corresponds not to a
single genomic region but to multiple regions. Chimerism may be due to either
co-ligation of multiple genomic segments into a single YAC, or recombination of
two or more YACs transformed in the same host Yeast cell.[15] The incidence of
chimerism may be as high as 50%.[16] Other artifacts are deletion of segments
from a cloned region, and rearrangement of genomic segments (such as
inversion). In all these cases, the sequence as determined from the YAC clone
is different from the original, natural sequence, leading to inconsistent
results and errors in interpretation if the clone's information is relied upon.
Due to these issues, the Human_Genome_Project ultimately abandoned the use of
YACs and switched to bacterial_artificial_chromosomes, where the incidence of
these artifacts is very low. In addition to stability issues, specifically the
relatively frequent occurrence of chimeric events, YACs proved to be
inefficient when generating the minimum tiling path covering the entire human
genome. Generating the clone libraries is time consuming. Also, due to the
nature of the reliance on sequence_tagged_sites_(STS) as a reference point when
selecting appropriate clones, there are large gaps that need further generation
of libraries to span. It is this additional hindrance that drove the project to
utilize BACs instead.[17] This is due to two factors:[18]
1) BACs are much quicker to generate, and when generating redundant libraries
of clones, this is essential
2) BACs allow more dense coverage with STSs, resulting in more complete and
efficient minimum tiling paths generated in silico.
However, it is possible to utilize both approaches, as was demonstrated when
the genome of the nematode, C. elegans. There majority of the genome was tiled
with BACs, and the gaps filled in with YACs.[17]
