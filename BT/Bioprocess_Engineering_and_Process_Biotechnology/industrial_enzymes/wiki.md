From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Industrial enzymes are enzymes that are commercially used in a variety of
industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemical production, biofuels, food &
beverage, and consumer products. Due to advancements in recent years,
biocatalysis through isolated enzymes is considered more economical than use of
whole cells. Enzymes may be used as a unit_operation within a process to
generate a desired product, or may be the product of interest. Industrial
biological catalysis through enzymes has experienced rapid growth in recent
years due to their ability to operate at mild conditions, and exceptional
chiral and positional specificity, things that traditional chemical processes
lack.[1] Isolated enzymes are typically used in hydrolytic and isomerization
reactions. Whole cells are typically used when a reaction requires a co-factor.
Although co-factors may be generated in_vitro, it is typically more cost-
effective to use metabolically active cells.[1]

***** Enzymes as a unit operation[edit] *****
**** Immobilization[edit] ****
Despite their excellent catalytic capabilities, enzymes and their properties
must be improved prior to industrial implementation in many cases. Some aspects
of enzymes that must be improved prior to implementation are stability,
activity, inhibition by reaction products, and selectivity towards non-natural
substrates. This may be accomplished through immobilization of enzymes on a
solid material, such as a porous support.[2] Immobilization of enzymes greatly
simplifies the recovery process, enhances process control, and reduces
operational costs. Many immobilization techniques exist, such as adsorption,
covalent binding, affinity, and entrapment.[3] Ideal immobilization processes
should not use highly toxic reagents in the immobilization technique to ensure
stability of the enzymes.[4] After immobilization is complete, the enzymes are
introduced into a reaction vessel for biocatalysis.
*** Adsorption[edit] ***
Enzyme adsorption onto carriers functions based on chemical and physical
phenomena such as van_der_Waals_forces, ionic_interactions, and hydrogen
bonding. These forces are weak, and as a result, do not affect the structure of
the enzyme. A wide variety of enzyme carriers may be used. Selection of a
carrier is dependent upon the surface area, particle size, pore structure, and
type of functional group.[5]
*** Covalent binding[edit] ***
Example of Enzyme Immobilization through Covalent Binding
Many binding chemistries may be used to adhere an enzyme to a surface to
varying degrees of success. The most successful covalent_binding techniques
include binding via glutaraldehyde to amino_groups and N-hydroxysuccinide
esters. These immobilization techniques occur at ambient temperatures in mild
conditions, which have limited potential to modify the structure and function
of the enzyme.[6]
*** Affinity[edit] ***
Immobilization using affinity relies on the specificity of an enzyme to couple
an affinity ligand to an enzyme to form a covalently bound enzyme-ligand
complex. The complex is introduced into a support matrix for which the ligand
has high binding affinity, and the enzyme is immobilized through ligand-support
interactions.[3]
*** Entrapment[edit] ***
Immobilization using entrapment relies on trapping enzymes within gels or
fibers, using non-covalent interactions. Characteristics that define a
successful entrapping material include high surface area, uniform pore
distribution, tunable pore size, and high adsorption capacity.[3]
**** Recovery[edit] ****
Enzymes typically constitute a significant operational cost for industrial
processes, and in many cases, must be recovered and reused to ensure economic
feasibility of a process. Although some biocatalytic processes operate using
organic solvents, the majority of processes occur in aqueous environments,
improving the ease of separation.[1] Most biocatalytic processes occur in
batch, differentiating them from conventional chemical processes. As a result,
typical bioprocesses employ a separation technique after bioconversion. In this
case, product accumulation may cause inhibition of enzyme activity. Ongoing
research is performed to develop in situ separation techniques, where product
is removed from the batch during the conversion process. Enzyme separation may
be accomplished through solid-liquid extraction techniques such as
centrifugation or filtration, and the product-containing solution is fed
downstream for product separation.[1]

***** Enzymes as a desired product[edit] *****
To industrialize an enzyme, the following upstream and downstream enzyme
production processes are considered:
**** Upstream[edit] ****
Upstream processes are those that contribute to the generation of the enzyme.
*** Selection of a suitable enzyme[edit] ***
An enzyme must be selected based upon the desired reaction. The selected enzyme
defines the required operational properties, such as pH, temperature, activity,
and substrate affinity.[12]
*** Identification and selection of a suitable source for the selected enzyme
[edit] ***
The choice of a source of enzymes is an important step in the production of
enzymes. It is common to examine the role of enzymes in nature, and how they
relate to the desired industrial process. Enzymes are most commonly sourced
through bacteria, fungi, and yeast. Once the source of the enzyme is selected,
genetic modifications may be performed to increase the expression of the gene
responsible for producing the enzyme.[12]
*** Process development[edit] ***
Process development is typically performed after genetic modification of the
source organism, and involves the modification of the culture medium and growth
conditions. In many cases, process development aims to reduce mRNA hydrolysis
and proteolysis.[12]
*** Large scale production[edit] ***
Scaling up of enzyme production requires optimization of the fermentation
process. Most enzymes are produced under aerobic conditions, and as a result,
require constant oxygen input, impacting fermenter design. Due to variations in
the distribution of dissolved oxygen, as well as temperature, pH, and
nutrients, the transport phenomena associated with these parameters must be
considered. The highest possible productivity of the fermenter is achieved at
maximum transport capacity of the fermenter.[12][13]
**** Downstream[edit] ****
Downstream processes are those that contribute to separation or purification of
enzymes.
*** Removal of insoluble materials and recovery of enzymes from the source
[edit] ***
The procedures for enzyme recovery depend on the source organism, and whether
enzymes are intracellular or extracellular. Typically, intracellular enzymes
require cell lysis and separation of complex biochemical mixtures.
Extracellular enzymes are released into the culture medium, and are much
simpler to separate. Enzymes must maintain their native conformation to ensure
their catalytic capability. Since enzymes are very sensitive to pH,
temperature, and ionic strength of the medium, mild isolation conditions must
be used.[12]
*** Concentration and primary purification of enzymes[edit] ***
Depending on the intended use of the enzyme, different levels purity are
required. For example, enzymes used for diagnostic purposes must be separated
to a higher purity than bulk industrial enzymes to prevent catalytic activity
that provides erroneous results. Enzymes used for therapeutic purposes
typically require the most rigorous separation. Most commonly, a combination of
chromatography steps is employed for separation.[12]
The purified enzymes are either sold in pure form and sold to other industries,
or added to consumer goods.
